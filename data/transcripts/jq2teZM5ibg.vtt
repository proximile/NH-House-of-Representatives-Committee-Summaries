you Mr chair and good morning members of

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
record my name is Keith Ammon and I
 
00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro District
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
42 and that includes the towns of New
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
Boston Mount Vernon and
 
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
lineboro and I'm here to introduce uh
 
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
1146 that deals with the removal of a
 
00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 align:start position:0%
voter from the
 
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
checklist so this bill this is a
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
constituent request this bill and um
 
00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
we'll hear some testimony from uh the
 
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
constituent that requested the bill
 
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
after me and uh so I'll tell the story
 
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
as as I can recall it in Mount Vernon uh
 
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
there was a voter who would who
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
requested to be removed from the
 
00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
checklist and um the Secretary of
 
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
State's office I believe uh said that
 
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
that's not possible there isn't a
 
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
statute that allows someone to do that
 
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
which is surprising to me and so that's
 
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do it it would
 
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
create a process for someone to request
 
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
their name to be removed from the
 
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
checklist and this would be similar to
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
if someone moved out of state or out of
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
district and there were no longer uh you
 
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
know uh validly part of the
 
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
checklist um and so the process is very
 
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 align:start position:0%
similar and you might ask why would
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
someone want to do this um I think it
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
would be personal reasons but I can
 
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
think of a few um someone might be
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
disaffected with politics someone might
 
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
be uh there's some religions that uh
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
don't allow someone to vote uh so
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
someone might have a a change in faith
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
that would require them uh to not vote
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
and so I I couldn't tell you the
 
00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
particular reason for this uh this
 
00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
constituent request um but I think there
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
should be a process uh that
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
is uh verifiable and make sure that the
 
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
checklist remains you know uh keeps its
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
Integrity so that we have uh solid
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
voting uh
 
00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 align:start position:0%
roles so with that I'll I'll take any
 
00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.830 align:start position:0%
roles so with that I'll I'll take any
questions

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:01.879 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:06.990 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you um I'm out of
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
practice um can they come back and sign
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
up again is there a process where or
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
once they're off they're off no they
 
00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:20.879 align:start position:0%
could change their mind again and they'd
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
have to go through the process of of you
 
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
know reestablishing their their name on
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
the voter
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
roles further questions
 
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
um I actually have one um would you I
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
know that this is a constituent bill but
 
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
would you be opposed if we change
 
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
sections 1 and two basically lines 8
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
through 13 instead of having it be
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
witnessed by an election official if it
 
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
was just a notorized um because to your
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
point about somebody moves right now in
 
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
theory they'd have to fly back to New
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh to go to the town to be
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
removed um instead of just having it
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
would you be objectionable to that if it
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
was just a notorized
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
document yeah what however the committee
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh sees fit um I know the person coming
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
after me is actually uh the the
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
supervisor of a checklist in Mount
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
Vernon so they may have some additional
 
00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:12.919 align:start position:0%
input on that question uh any other
 
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee this might
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
be the fastest one we do today all right
 
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:17.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ammon okay
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next up is William
 
00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.589 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next up is William
Sandford

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
Sandford
 
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
um Mr Sanford what town do you live in
 
00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:26.919 align:start position:0%
when you get up
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
most people have never heard of it I
 
00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:35.959 align:start position:0%
have heard of Mount Vernon and not just
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh and not just the
 
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
um George
 
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
differently good to go all right I'm one
 
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
of the supervisors of the checklist we
 
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
have three and I've been doing this for
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
about eight years now I just signed up
 
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
to be on the ballot for the next term uh
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
this bill came because a constituent a
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
voter came to me and wanted to be
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
removed from the checklist so I started
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
to do it and I realized there's no way
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
to do this on Election net so I called
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
Bud Fitch and he said that's right you
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
have no power to take somebody off the
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
checklist unless number one they die or
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
number two they have moved out of the
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and that's very easy to do
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
now in answer to your question uh if
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
somebody leaves the checklist once to be
 
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
removed from the checklist and then they
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
want to come back to the checklist it's
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
very easy to do all they have to do is
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
re-register for us to remove someone is
 
00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
it takes two seconds to do that on the
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
election net for us to re-register them
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
it takes three seconds to do that so
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
there's no time involved in
 
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.150 align:start position:0%
there's no time involved in
this

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
um as far as as far as the voter is
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
concerned this is the one person in
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
eight years that has requested to to be
 
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
removed from the checklist so it's not a
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
common practice but it should be
 
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
legal are you willing to take questions
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
from the committee sure are there
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
representative wood Yeah you mentioned
 
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
uh legal ways to take your name off the
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
checklist are the those the only two yes
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
so the ask for a follow up there I'm
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
sorry it's all right you go ahead so you
 
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
were saying the uh if the death death
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
certificate so that Trigg is the removal
 
00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
well we get we get news of a person who
 
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
has passed from the vital records
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
Network in New Hampshire so it will call
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
it will show up on our election net
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
reminder screen I don't know if you're
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
familiar with election net okay it shows
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
up on the reminder screen so we um take
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
a look at that we remove the voter from
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
the checklist so they're gone forever as
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
far as somebody moving out of the CH out
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:10:59.230 --> 00:10:59.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um if they have registered
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
in another town or another state we will
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
also know about that so we can remove
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
them but those are the only two ways
 
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
right now you thank you for saving
 
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
another followup thank
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
you represent B yeah also you to another
 
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
state you get a notice uh is that always
 
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
true because for example my
 
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
granddaughter had moved working in in
 
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
Chicago some years ago and she had a
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
Illinois driver's license everything and
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
was Voting in Chicago and in order to be
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
removed town clerk says she needs to
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
come to show her ID which she couldn't
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
because she was you know so you said you
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
get notice but you only get notice if
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
the J new jurisdiction sends you notice
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
there are 28 states that use the
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
election net system and if she was not
 
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
in one of those States then we wouldn't
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
know about it but if she hasn't voted in
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
the last four years or in the last four
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
elections but that we would have a purge
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
right yeah okay thank
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative wey
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh just for uh hypothetical so to help
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
me understand removing people from the
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
checklist suppose you had
 
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
someone uh in in the town or Community
 
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
who uh noticed that someone was uh no
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
longer living in their uh residents but
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
had um not
 
00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
registered or had not uh filed anything
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
saying they should be removed from the
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
checklist um is there any mechanism to
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
deal with that sort of issue where if
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
they haven't you know if they voted
 
00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
within the last couple of years but but
 
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
they have since moved out but provided
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
no notification and hadn't yet been
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
registered on the you know uh electronic
 
00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:56.839 align:start position:0%
list yeah to to uh be able to notify you
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
directly well periodically during the
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
year we form a 30-day list where we put
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
people on the list that we think have
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
moved out of town or even out of state a
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
neighbor could tell us hey so and so
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
sold his house and moved out of town so
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
we put that person on a 30-day list and
 
00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
we send them a letter if you don't
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
respond within 30 days you'll be removed
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
checklist but that's the only way we can
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
do something like
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
that further questions followup yeses
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
that that is that codified within the
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
RSA or is is that a good just a good so
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
it is okay right and we do that
 
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
periodically during the year maybe twice
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
a year in our small town maybe twice a
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
year yeah thank you further questions
 
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.829 align:start position:0%
year yeah thank you further questions
representative

00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
Bay so um if some you said uh somebody
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
might have said that uh a neighbor had
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
moved and and so forth um is there no
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
other a formal process because if if uh
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
for example if a person is not very
 
00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:08.839 align:start position:0%
friendly to their neighbors and no one
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
had told you so that that person will be
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
forever in the checklist in
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
theory again we'd have to send them a
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
30-day may I follow up it's fine Mr
 
00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
chair yes um so there there's no process
 
00:14:24.199 --> 00:14:25.350 align:start position:0%
chair yes um so there there's no process
of

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
um let's say uh the realtor will so the
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
house uh and then there there will be a
 
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
notification no okay the problem with
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
somebody saying so and so sold their
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
house at times they sold their house but
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
they move within the town so we can't
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
remove them from the checklist we can
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
change their address but we can't remove
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
them thank you thank you Mr chair person
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
of course further questions from the
 
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
committee saying none thank you so much
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
no um last up to speak is Dan Healey
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire uh clerks in you
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
know what you know who yeah you know who
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
you're from I'll and I'll learn to speak
 
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:12.350 align:start position:0%
you're from I'll and I'll learn to speak
English

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
today hi uh Dan Hy uh NAA city clerk uh
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire Clerk's
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
Association uh so we oppose um HB
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
1146 uh the law already provides a few
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
ways to remove a voter from the
 
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
checklist and we our concerns with this
 
00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
bill um allowing someone to come in and
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
have their name removed uh whenever
 
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
they'd like poses a problem so for this
 
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
past presidential primary uh party
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
changes closed October 6th so someone
 
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
that didn't switch their party could
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
come in remove themsel from the voter
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
checklist so then re-register on
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
Election Day as the party that they um
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
then wanted uh also we have residents
 
00:16:12.749 --> 00:16:12.759 align:start position:0%
that come in that don't like that um the
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
voter checklist is public and they don't
 
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
want their name on it so they come in
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
they ask to be removed but they intend
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
to still vote in the future so they
 
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
would be removing themselves to
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
re-register and so we get the intent of
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
but overall with the different
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
scenarios um I think a person could come
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
in they could remove themselves to then
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
be added
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
later uh just for these these various
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
reasons uh that's why we oppose this
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
bill i' be open to any questions
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
committee okay uh so if we fix the uh
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
party switch Clause you'd be good to
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
go um so what would that entail it would
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
be a provision in the bill that said you
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
know you cannot use this for the purpose
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
of changing your party after the
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
deadline because I just I think it would
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
be hard to track on Election Day uh a
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
lot of the um the supervisors of the
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
checklist or the registrars depending on
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
how big the um the municipality is they
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
don't have access to see if someone's
 
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
registered prior so I think someone came
 
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
in they registered prior and then they
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
register again on election day there's
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
not a lot of ways to go back and check
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
that until we're entering it the days
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
following so I think it it kind of
 
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.510 align:start position:0%
following so I think it it kind of
complicates

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
complicates
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
things okay I'm going oh I
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
you uh well I I I do but we let we're
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to let other reps to ask before
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
you just start doing the follow-ups all
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
right um so there was recently a ruling
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
by the First Circuit Court of Appeals uh
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
that the under the national voter
 
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
registration Act of 1993 Main's voter
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
roles had to be public record does that
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
impact your position on whether or not
 
00:18:10.149 --> 00:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
voter voter checklists have to be uh
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
made public so our voter checklist right
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
now is public so it's um so I'm I'm the
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
clerk out of NASA if you walked into the
 
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
NASA City Hall our voter uh checklist is
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
sitting on the uh desk in the lobby of
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
of the city clerk's office so anyone can
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
come in and and look at that information
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
and I did have a situation a few years
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
ago where um when I was working in a
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
different municipality a voter came in
 
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
and they asked for their name to be
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
removed but they informed me that they
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
are still interested in voting at every
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
election they want their name to be
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
removed and then to re-register every
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
time just because they didn't want uh
 
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
someone to be able to come in and look
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
up their information so I do we have
 
00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
those concerns that it could be used in
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:02.590 align:start position:0%
 
further

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:06.039 align:start position:0%
questions representative HR um wouldn't
 
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
that be a confidential voter or is that
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
a different so a a confidential voter um
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
if they have a your court order
 
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
protective order um where their identity
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be hidden that's a separate um
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
issue this this person uh did not have
 
00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
that they were just looking they didn't
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
want maybe the phone calls or the mail
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
or maybe their neighbor to see what
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
party they're registered as they just
 
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:36.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
list further questions representative
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you um can you just remind us
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
again what information is on the voter
 
00:19:50.909 --> 00:19:50.919 align:start position:0%
checklist so on the voter checklist is
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
their uh unique voter ID that's
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
generated when we enter the voter into
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
our election portal uh it's their name
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
um their domicile
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
affiliation further
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
questions so this they're sending in an
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit could we have a checkbox on
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
the affidavit that says that they do not
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
intend to vote in the next election
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
would that ass suade your concern since
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
an affidavit is a sworn statement
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
um that would yeah that would help um I
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
just I see it being used used not for
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
the way that it was intended I get the
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
intention of it of the bill and um we
 
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
you know we agree with the intention but
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
we looking at it we think that it could
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
be used for you know other ways around
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
say the party affiliation thing or to
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
get someone's name off the list and then
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
on okay uh further questions seeing none
 
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh last up is the a
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
late entry the great secretary skate
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David scanland Secretary
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
of State um I just want to provide a
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
little information on this bill um I
 
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
understand the reason why somebody might
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
submit it because we get plenty of calls
 
00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:24.039 align:start position:0%
in our office from voters who would like
 
00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:26.919 align:start position:0%
to have their name removed from the list
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
for various reasons probably the most
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
common one is the amount of mail uh that
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
they get during campaign season but uh
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
voters get particularly a aggravated
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
when the number of phone calls uh and
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
personal contacts go way up um we try to
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
explain to the voters when they call
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
that in the in the process of collecting
 
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
the voter registration information when
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
they fill out the form we are not taking
 
00:21:59.470 --> 00:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
their phone number uh or their email
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
address that whoever is contacting them
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
has gotten that data from some other uh
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
location um there is a a
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
a a basic premise to elections and that
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
is uh in addition to you know voters
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
having the right to vote and to do so
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
conveniently and easily there is also a
 
00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
right for members of a community to know
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
who is particip ipating in the election
 
00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
process and that's why checklists are
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
important and that's why there's a voter
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
history that is uh tagged along with
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
that so that uh anybody who's interested
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
can make sure that the voters that are
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
participating are actually qualified uh
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
to vote in an
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
election the um couple of concerns that
 
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
I have with the bill are uh
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
one if you were uh as a matter of policy
 
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to let people be removed
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
from the checklist there's no direction
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
in here about the frequency at which
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
that could happen I mean technically you
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
could have people showing up and
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
registering at the polls on the day of
 
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.669 align:start position:0%
registering at the polls on the day of
the

00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
election and then having their name
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
removed from the N list the next day if
 
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.590 align:start position:0%
removed from the N list the next day if
not

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
sooner and you know that causes problems
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
in making sure I mean if if if there was
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
concern about whether that individual
 
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
was qualified to vote being able to
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
track them uh and and just you know
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
verify their their status as a
 
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
voter um I'm looking at the bill itself
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
one lines 11 through 13 Roman numeral
 
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
number two where it says that a voter
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
shall present a valid photo
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
identification to the official and this
 
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
is to have their name removed from the
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
list the election official offal shall
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
examine the photo
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
identification and confirm that the name
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
domicile address and date of birth match
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
the information provided on the
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
affidavit there are many forms of
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
acceptable ID that can be presented
 
00:24:16.269 --> 00:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
photo ID that does not have that
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
information on it it could be the name
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
of a of a person who um got married and
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
their name changed so that information
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
might not be accurate there are many
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
photo IDs that do not have birth dates
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
on them uh and and even a driver's
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
license may not have an accurate
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
domicile address so I I think that uh
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
you know that that provision in the
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
statute or in the proposed
 
00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:47.420 align:start position:0%
legislation uh is
 
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.909 align:start position:0%
legislation uh is
[Music]

00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:48.919 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
problematic I think I'll stop there Mr
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
chairman and and just answer any
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
questions the committee might have
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
excellent questions from the
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
committee represent weing uh thank you
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
secretary scandin would so if if the
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
identification aligned with uh other
 
00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
areas of the RSA that um for
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
registration would you be amendable to
 
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
that I I think that if I think that if
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
the committee were going to go along
 
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
with this that if you matched up the the
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
comparison of the information you just
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
use similar language to other sections
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
of the statute like a registration form
 
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
qua thank you Mr chairman uh the idea
 
00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:38.919 align:start position:0%
was mentioned just a couple of minutes
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
ago about someone going through this
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
process and filling out an affidavit
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
that they I think it was said wouldn't
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
vote in the next election could could
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
someone actually alienate their right to
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
vote in that fashion so they couldn't
 
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
change their mind before the next
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
election I don't believe they could I
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
think that would be a violation of
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
you further questions all right seeing
 
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
none thank you secretary scalan uh
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%

00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:11.559 align:start position:0%
don't have my computer up yet um there's
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
no other speakers signed up to speak and
 
00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
if the committee will indulge me I
 
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
should have had my computer up for this
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh I'll read the uh sign in um I tell
 
00:26:20.909 --> 00:26:20.919 align:start position:0%
you what we'll actually stand in recess
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%

to answer any questions I'm sorry
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
question comments okay uh so what we're
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
going to do here representative Reed did
 
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
let me know um she has another bill um
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
being introduced literally at the exact
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
same time by the way thank you
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
representative Lane um for doing that um
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
so what we're going to do is we're we're
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
going to start the public testimony the
 
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
um and when representative re gets here
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
um if we're still in the middle of
 
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
public testimony I will probably try to
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
pause the public testimony allow her to
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
kind of do the formal introduction but
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
what I don't want is the committee to
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
fall behind today um so we're going to
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
be a little ad hoc on that um but I want
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
to respect everybody's time so first up
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.630 align:start position:0%
 
zinc

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
zinc
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh good morning members of the committee
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
my for the record my name is Olivia zinc
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'm a voter in Franklin and the
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
executive director of open democracy
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to give some background um
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
this we have um prohibition of campaign
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
spending in our laws and in
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
1999 um uh stretch Kennedy took this to
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
court against Bill Gardner and uh the
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
court basically said that corporations
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
were allowed owed to make campaign
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
contributions um but they needed to do
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
it through a segregated fund the court
 
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
outlined what the legislator needed to
 
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
do to fix this and this is what that is
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
so this is just making our law our
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
campaign law compliant with what the
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
court asked us to do years ago um so
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's all this is um it should be a
 
00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:27.079 align:start position:0%
simple thing um and if anybody wants the
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
court case Kennedy versus Gardener um
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to bring it or email it um I
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
didn't print it out this morning
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
apologies um with that I can take some
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
questions if anyone has any Kennedy
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
versus Gardner I would have loved to
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
seeing that one that two names which
 
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
shall live in infamy representative Wei

00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
much further questions from the
 
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:02.599 align:start position:0%
committee okay seeing none uh next up
 
00:37:20.589 --> 00:37:20.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
langel good morning uh for the record my
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
name is Katherine LEL and I'm a year old
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
voter from conquered I'm a student at St
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
anom College serving as open democracy
 
00:37:34.349 --> 00:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
actions public policy fellow um open
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
democracy action is a nonpartisan
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofit uh that focuses on advocating
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
for campaign Finance reform uh and and
 
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
voter rights so this bill came to our
 
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
attention um after examining the bill I
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to vote a to pass um
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
the language used would standardize
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
actions taken by labor unions and
 
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
business organizations to participate in
 
00:37:56.119 --> 00:37:57.230 align:start position:0%
business organizations to participate in
government

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
um the ability for groups to express
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
their support is pivotal to our
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
democracy um and lines 13 through 15 of
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
the proposed Bill read quote provided
 
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
the committee's expenditures and
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
contributions are made through a
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
separate segregated fund consisting only
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
of voluntary
 
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
contributions um solicited from
 
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
individuals who are employees officers
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
Etc um this language would ensure that
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
the money allocated to support any
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
political Pursuit would come directly
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
from within the union or the group
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
itself eliminating the potential for
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
private gain um and it would like I said
 
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
essentially standardize this process um
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
which could be very helpful in
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh helping with uh sorry trying to word
 
00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:47.780 align:start position:0%
this it's
 
00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.230 align:start position:0%
this it's
[Music]

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
morning uh standardizing it and helping
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
with election uh integrity and campaign
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
Integrity um yeah my I'm so proud to say
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
that my dad was the vice president of
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
the conquered firefighters 1045 local
 
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
1045 so I asked him about this bill um
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
to gain some context because I'm a
 
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
college student I did not know very much
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
about kind of how this works um and he
 
00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
was able to provide uh some context and
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
let me know that this is a this process
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
is a lot of what people already do
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
standardizing it would just uh secure
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
that Integrity so I'm happy to take
 
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
questions okay questions from the
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
Lane um thank you uh my understanding is
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
that this puts corporations and unions
 
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
on a level footing is that correct am I
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
understanding that correct when you talk
 
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
about the process and sure okay
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
um that wasn't my understanding my
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
that that's my
 
00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
boss um so it would yes uh both
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
processes would be standardized so yeah
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay hearing none um thank you um we
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
don't have anyone else sign up to speak
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
I will say I forgot to announce on 11:46
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
we had 51 signed up in support three
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
opposed uh with that this committee this
 
00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
bill will be recessed until but
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
basically what we're going to do is kind
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
of like rolling five minute recesses so
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
you can kind of go where you want to go
 
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's enough time to use the bathroom and
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
come back um so we're going to reset
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
until 9:40 and if representative Reed's
 
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
not here I'm going to gavl in and gavel
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
out till 9:45 and then at 9:45 I'll
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
gavel in and gavel out till 950 and
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
we'll just keep going like that until
 
00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:39.079 align:start position:0%
representative re can come here um so
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
that's the game plan so with that I will

necessary protections for our election
 
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:35.960 align:start position:0%

all right repres TR 11:47 relative to
 
00:55:09.549 --> 00:55:09.559 align:start position:0%
the permissible campaign contribut by

business organization unions thank you
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
so much Mr chair um I do have to
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
introduce four of my own bills today so
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
um one down and apparently three more to
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
go okay so uh thank you this bill simply
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
seeks to treat Corporation corporate
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
political donations the same as we
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
already treat labor union donations the
 
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
history of this is that back in the the
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
teens 19 teens around 1917 Teddy
 
00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
Roosevelt um famously railed against
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
political corruption and um under that
 
00:55:49.789 --> 00:55:49.799 align:start position:0%
Administration direct um contributions
 
00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:52.039 align:start position:0%
from corporations became illegal across
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
the country still is illegal to this day
 
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh for federal elections from
 
00:55:58.750 --> 00:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
corporations to political campaigns at
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
that time very many states New Hampshire
 
00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:04.839 align:start position:0%
included also made direct um or made any
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
donations from corporations to uh
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
political campaigns illegal after that
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
came the rise of labor unions and at
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
that time our laws which are still the
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
laws on the books today said that labor
 
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
unions can donate but it has to be from
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
a segregated fund it can't be from the
 
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
the general fund which is funded by dues
 
00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:26.200 align:start position:0%
it has to be from separate political
 
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
what we call today a Pac political fund
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
that is specifically donated to for
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
political purposes um and so what we had
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
was a complete ban on corporate
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
donations and a kind of
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
regulation on uh on labor union
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
donations and in the 90s so nearly a
 
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
hundred years after the original
 
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
complete ban on corporations um the
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court of the state struck down
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
the corporate ban is overly Broad and
 
00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
they specifically in their casee as you
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
may have already heard um referenced the
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
fact that the regulation on labor unions
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
allowed donations as long as it was from
 
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
a dedicated fund and therefore um the
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
corporate language should be the same
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
and they recommended that we do exactly
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
that in our
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
legislation and we never did it simply
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
was struck down and we never went back
 
00:57:21.029 --> 00:57:21.039 align:start position:0%
and did what the Supreme Court said
 
00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:23.039 align:start position:0%
which was to have the same language
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
impact corporations and labor unions
 
00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
equally and that is what this bill does
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
so it simply says the the labor unions
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
the language that already exists I
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
simply add or business so in that first
 
00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph So the existing words are by
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
any L labor union or group of labor
 
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
unions and then it says um because this
 
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
is under the prohibition and then I say
 
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
or by any business organization or any
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
officer acting in the business so we're
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
just we're bringing it under the same
 
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
language and then these second paragraph
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
says allows for that political action
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee for both labor unions and
 
00:58:04.109 --> 00:58:04.119 align:start position:0%
explicitly for both L labor unions and
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
businesses and with that I'm happy to
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
take questions questions from the
 
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
committee representative weie wrong
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
Bill hi thank you for your
 
00:58:14.119 --> 00:58:17.750 align:start position:0%
Bill hi thank you for your
testimony

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
um I understand that that uh there are
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
also single single member llc's that
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
would be equivalent to sole
 
00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
proprietorships but there is a
 
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
distinction within the Secretary of
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
State's office I think for company
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
registrations and the like would you be
 
00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.470 align:start position:0%
registrations and the like would you be
amendable

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
amendable
 
00:58:40.109 --> 00:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
to uh amending that uh last line on
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
eight and N to include single member
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
llc's if that's the the direction this
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to go in I would
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
support that I just think the major
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
thing is that we do not treat unions and
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
businesses differently when it comes to
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
their politic iCal
 
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
donations thank you representative
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
Hamlet thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
um how does this relate to the citizens
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
united decision didn't is this more
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
restrictive so this only has to do with
 
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
direct contributions to political
 
00:59:20.029 --> 00:59:20.039 align:start position:0%
campaigns the citizens united decision
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
has to do with independent expenditures
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
so that these are two completely
 
00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:26.839 align:start position:0%
separate um issues so just to be clear
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
for the entire Committee in case there's
 
00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
any confusion because obviously all
 
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
these things can get confusing um so a
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
direct contribution is where a business
 
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
which is what I seek to address or a
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
labor union or whoever directly gives
 
00:59:40.349 --> 00:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
money to a campaign Ellen for New
 
00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for example um an independent
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
expenditure is and according to Citizens
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
United there has to be no cooperation
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
between the two groups is where I might
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
on my own buy ads for Joan Hamlet right
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
but you're not supposed to cooperate
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
with me on that whatsoever and what
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
citizens united said is that that
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
independent expenditure as long as
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
there's no cooperation is unregulated
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
and and unlimited but this is only has
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
to do with direct
 
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
contributions okay thank you further
 
01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:15.079 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative see we did it
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
we did it we did it I apologize and
 
01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:20.039 align:start position:0%

by limited liability companies or
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
llc's I'm representative cat McGee from
 
01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:33.559 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 35 which is Hollis um in the
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
last several Cycles we have had some
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
form of this bill and it is
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
affectionately known as the LLC loophole
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
bill so you may have heard of it um that
 
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
is because it seeks to mend a loophole
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
in our statutory language that
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
undermines our own individual campaign
 
01:04:51.799 --> 01:04:53.150 align:start position:0%
undermines our own individual campaign

Finance
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
limits in a June 2023 New Hampshire
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
bulletin article on New Hampshire
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance changes I found this
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
quote quote individuals have always been
 
01:05:08.349 --> 01:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
able to find ways to skirt campaign
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
Finance limits in the state argued Greg
 
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
Moore the state director for Americans
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
Prosperity New Hampshire a conservative
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
advocacy group one popular way is
 
01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
through the use of quote limited
 
01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:23.799 align:start position:0%
liability corporations that individuals
 
01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:27.559 align:start position:0%
can form to increase their donations a
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
process reformers call the LLC
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
loophole so Mr Moore is saying that if
 
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
an individual who has a limit of
 
01:05:38.829 --> 01:05:38.839 align:start position:0%
$115,000 over three different reporting
 
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
periods per campaign cycle per candidate
 
01:05:44.589 --> 01:05:44.599 align:start position:0%
wants to skirt that individual limit
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
then they can create an LLC or shell
 
01:05:49.549 --> 01:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
Corp to hide the fact that they are
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
bundling money to give more than the
 
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
legal limit but that is a bad habit we
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
have allowed to take root and clearly it
 
01:05:59.269 --> 01:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
is not the intent of the
 
01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
law the Law's intent is to place some
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
restriction on escalating costs of
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
Elections which as anyone who identifies
 
01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:10.119 align:start position:0%
as fiscally conservative must admit is
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
an incredible waste of money at this
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
point um where does it end if anyone can
 
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
flout the rules and we as a legislative
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
body who continue uh continue to look
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
the other way this bill seeks to add the
 
01:06:27.269 --> 01:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
transparency necessary to know who is
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
contributing what via the New Hampshire
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's campaign Finance
 
01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
reporting system if you are part of an
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
LLC we should have your name uh and
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
contact information when a political
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
donation is made not an innocuous shell
 
01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
Corporation that's specifically designed
 
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
to sidestep the disclosure of donor
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
information and everyone else uh has to
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
follow that everyone else has to follow
 
01:06:54.029 --> 01:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
if there are three people involved
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
involved in the LLC they get onethird of
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
the donation attributed to them so
 
01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
individual limits can be tracked as the
 
01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:03.029 align:start position:0%
individual limits can be tracked as the
law

01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:07:05.549 --> 01:07:05.559 align:start position:0%
intends HB
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
1074 asks that we provide some direction
 
01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:11.079 align:start position:0%
for the secretary scanland office in
 
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
order that in order to remove the guess
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
work in whether an LLC is actually just
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
a Dodge of the campaign Finance rules
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
llc's are designed to remove Li ility
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
from individuals for Investments and
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
other Financial transactions the LLC is
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
a protection uh for the individual but
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
it was never designed to provide a cloak
 
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
of secrecy for donors in campaign
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
Finance systems and that requires
 
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
everyone else to be transparent about
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
where election money
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
originates if we want people to have
 
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
faith in us and their elections we
 
01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
should recommend HB 1074 out of
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
committee OTP to make clear that
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
everyone plays by the same rules when we
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
create Financial limits on contributions
 
01:08:02.109 --> 01:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
we need to require the disclosures that
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
allow us to verify that donors are
 
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
working within state law thank
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
you okay we've taken questions from the
 
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
committee oh be happy to all right other
 
01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
qualey thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:08:20.349 --> 01:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
you representative for speaking with us
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
today uh I'm aware that some C's can
 
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
consist of Partnerships with multiple me
 
01:08:28.749 --> 01:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
Members I don't know of an upper limit
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
there could be three four or
 
01:08:35.309 --> 01:08:35.319 align:start position:0%
five uh suppose we have a scenario where
 
01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
in in Partnerships in my experience are
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
typically divided by a vote of the
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
decisions are made by votes of the
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
members uh suppose we have a member of
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
an LLC partnership who was outvoted by
 
01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
the other members and did not have any
 
01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
wish to contribute to a particular
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
candidate does it seem right that that
 
01:09:00.749 --> 01:09:00.759 align:start position:0%
person should be ascribed a
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
contribution having made a contribution
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
when they that person had no desire to
 
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
do so thank you thank you for the
 
01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
question it's an interesting question
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
there are definitely um going to be
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
unique scenarios and edge cases as with
 
01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
any any law um the idea really is to say
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
if you are if you are part of an LLC is
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
making a contribution that contribution
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be adequately attributed so I
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that person would be happy
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
if they were donating to a candidate or
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
a cause that that person wasn't
 
01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
interested in or didn't support but I
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
think that that does not negate the need
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
for transparency around who is
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
contributing the money and how it should
 
01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
be attributed so the example that I gave
 
01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
of three
 
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
contributors it's just math right no
 
01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
matter how many folks are in that LLC
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
you can divide the money uh so that you
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
know and um and what it really is
 
01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
designed to do is just stop that
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
bundling that is clearly not the intent
 
01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
law further questions represent
 
01:10:16.590 --> 01:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
we thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um just kind of a
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
followup to the previous
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
question um uh for instance down in line
 
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
29 it talks about the amount of the
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
contribution attributed to each member
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
so you're you are you would anticipate
 
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
that an LLC
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
could allocate different portions and
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
not just
 
01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
average the amounts out to to all
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
members but could actually assign it to
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
you it would be it would be allocate
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
allocated evenly amongst the number of
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
members is the way I I believe the
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
wording okay that's what it means I
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
think so it couldn't it couldn't be
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
followup uh Mr chair uh representative
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
Lane has her hand up so she gets to go
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
first if she was so
 
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
choose I was going to say my
 
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of the law was that in
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
fact if if if it's
 
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
divided 30 20 whatever 50 that it would
 
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
be divided up in that manner and if it
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear that it would be presumed
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
to be a third a third a
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
third just that okay I assume there'll
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
one so you're saying it can be
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
designated if if different members of an
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
LLC want more of it attributed to them
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
is well the the have may I ask yes um
 
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
thank you the LLC agreement would would
 
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
um allocate it within the members so
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
that not they may not have all equal
 
01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
membership they may have it may be like
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
I said 30 20 50 or whatever you come up
 
01:12:08.669 --> 01:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
with and if they're going to give out
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
money then they would divide it up that
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
way most llc's are are are not making
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
political donations it's a very specific
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
kind so you wouldn't probably run into
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
this problem too often
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you does anyone else have any
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
questions before we go back to
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative wary all right let's just
 
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.709 --> 01:12:35.719 align:start position:0%
rep thank
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you for the
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
compliment um so um again following up
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
on uh the previous questions so if if
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
there are different levels of ownership
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
within the LLC or the
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and you know a a 10% member
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
might have 10% of a contribution
 
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
allocated to them versus someone who
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
owns 90% say um
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
or the LLC could choose to designate
 
01:13:18.629 --> 01:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
when they provide this information the
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
respective contribution levels do you
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
see anything I mean that would still get
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
at the intent you don't want an
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
individual contributing beyond their
 
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
stated amount under uh
 
01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.629 align:start position:0%
stated amount under uh
6645

01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
6645
 
01:13:37.639 --> 01:13:40.629 align:start position:0%
6645
um

01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
so it do you do you see that this could
 
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
be worded in such a way to account for
 
01:13:46.199 --> 01:13:48.070 align:start position:0%
be worded in such a way to account for
those

01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
factors I think that the language that
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
is here which has gone through several
 
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
iterations since I've been in the
 
01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
legislature is sufficient for the
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's Department to
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
Institute it I know that in I I'm in the
 
01:14:06.669 --> 01:14:06.679 align:start position:0%
electronic campaign Finance system and
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
um there are some folks who are opting
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
to give to multiple candidates very low
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
amounts of money so I'm getting you know
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
a163 or something you know I'm getting
 
01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh notices of of small amounts of money
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
electronically that are being donated to
 
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
my account through act blue which is a A
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
system that helps you know donations to
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
democratic causes and so the systems can
 
01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
do the math what we're asking for is
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
that we put in place a requirement that
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
there be an accounting of who's doing
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
what and that they acknowledge that so
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
transparency and what will happen is if
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
someone is contributing in multiple
 
01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
places in multiple amounts it will all
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
go to them just like it does in the
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
regular you know any any regular
 
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
contributor in the campaign Finance
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
system who puts um you know when we put
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
our donations in from different
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
individuals uh that system is capable of
 
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
calculating how much money the
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
individual has provided to individual
 
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
causes and candidates so it wouldn't be
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
any different uh for this they can do
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
it you want to go again yeah all right
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
so so does that risk so in the scenario
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
that I laid out before Grant it is a
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
hypothetical but could you sort of
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise the
 
01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
10% owner by by averaging out the
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
contribution and then they would not be
 
01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
able to contribute more to their
 
01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.310 align:start position:0%
able to contribute more to their
preferred

01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
preferred
 
01:15:44.189 --> 01:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
candidate no I think the actual 10% is
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
what would be would is what would be
 
01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
attributed to that person so the the
 
01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
LLC may be the donor but once you create
 
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
transparency with the people behind the
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
LLC then the contribution per individual
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
will only be calculated based upon what
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
percentage is attributable to them so if
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
was a 10 if was a $10,000 donation and
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
$1,000 was was representative we's um
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
then that is all that would be
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
attributed to you and so the balance of
 
01:16:20.629 --> 01:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
your individual campaign limit would
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
still be available to you and that's
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
okay um further questions uh
 
01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.550 align:start position:0%
okay um further questions uh
representative

01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you so much for taking my
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
question uh when we're talking about
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
contributions are we talking about
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
direct contributions or independent
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh direct contributions
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
sure further questions from the
 
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
represent McGee uh next up will be our
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
own representative Lane who's decided to
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
fry uh thank you uh Mr chair I'm a
 
01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill and um I can't
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
testify from up there to answer
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
questions so I thought it would be
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
better for me to be sitting here um my
 
01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
name is Connie LAN I am uh from
 
01:17:29.629 --> 01:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
conquered War I marac District uh 16 so
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
the the bill as U representative McGee
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
indicated is all it's transparency it's
 
01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
to allow people to be
 
01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
transparent most of these types of llc's
 
01:17:44.669 --> 01:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
are not the kind of llc's that most of
 
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
us think about where there's a
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
partnership or a small one they're
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
created specifically to get around
 
01:17:56.629 --> 01:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
this I know representative qua hates
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
this term this loophole or this way to
 
01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.110 align:start position:0%
this term this loophole or this way to
get

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
around the the limitation in the amount
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
and so if you look down at the bottom
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
it's on pay on number 27 so what happens
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
is when the limited liability company
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
contributes it provides the recipient
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
with the names and the addresses and
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
that all goes into the campaign Finance
 
01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
system and that's how it
 
01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
recorded so that's how the Secretary of
 
01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
State and the campaign Finance um system
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
will keep track of it and so to answer
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know representative we's concerns
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
yes it is possible that that one person
 
01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
could get the 10% but I would like to
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
think that in a partnership that they
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
would not do that to their own
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
partner yes it would be possible but
 
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
again this law is not really directed at
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
a typical LLC that we all tend to think
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
about and organize and give limited
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
liability for people who are you know
 
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
running their own business so these are
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
for people who do this on purpose to
 
01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
funnel money to political action
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
campaigns or to political campaigns and
 
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
to make them be transparent that's the
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
goal I assume you'll be taking questions
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
from the Comm oh yes sir oh yes all
 
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
right representative we we'll keep the
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
The Show Goes On
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
I I've been waiting to ask
 
01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
representative Lane questions for for a
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
long time long time so um so to that to
 
01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:33.910 align:start position:0%
long time long time so um so to that to
that

01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
end um yeah the the principle here is is
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
good but but um I'm just wondering if
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
there might be a better way of of
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
working it around do you think there
 
01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
might be a better way of working it
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
around by
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
more clearly identifying the purpose of
 
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
the LLC in its initial registrations or
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
things like that if they're creating
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
shell companies to do that facilitate
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
this should the law be directed more
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
toward the creation of the LLC and the
 
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
registration process there or or does it
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
belong in election law I just I'm yeah
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
curious I guess I hadn't thought about
 
01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
it that way but my concern is that most
 
01:20:26.189 --> 01:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
LC's when they form they have a clause
 
01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
that says in any other legal reason to
 
01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
do business in the state of New
 
01:20:33.149 --> 01:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there's a catchall clause
 
01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
So in theory any one of them could do
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
that they usually State the primary
 
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
reason so if the primary reason is a you
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
know auto part store or mechanic or
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
whatever that's the primary reason but
 
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
in theory they could go out and and they
 
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
can give money too so but it it's a good
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it solve the problem
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
totally but you know we could ask that
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
for people to do it but I'm not sure
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
first thises this probably just from
 
01:21:12.669 --> 01:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
ignorant thank you Mr chair um when you
 
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
form an
 
01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
LLC uh you can do it in any state or do
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
you have to do it in New Hampshire
 
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
correct so you can do it
 
01:21:21.639 --> 01:21:23.830 align:start position:0%
correct so you can do it
in

01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
yeah well now we have to go back to
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative weary and got do this
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
back and forth weirdness can I yield to
 
01:21:31.629 --> 01:21:31.639 align:start position:0%
you can y yeah absolutely yeah represent
 
01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
B go back it's a courtesy you know
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
I'm thank you
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative so if um wouldn't you say
 
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
that if we're going to
 
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:21:48.430 --> 01:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
Implement something such as okay you
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
have to to state that this LLC is uh
 
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
formed for for this particular purpose
 
01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
then effectively you're making all of
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
the states do that and and make that
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
part of the questionnaire when you form
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
an LLC which is like not within the
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
realm of what we can do in New Hampshire
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
actually no it would only we can only
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
govern New Hampshire llc's most people
 
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
actually form well I shouldn't say most
 
01:22:18.510 --> 01:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
many people form their llc's in
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
Delaware um because it's better known
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
the laws the courts are more favorable
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
to businesses and um everybody's pretty
 
01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
familiar with them so um but the fact
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
that they would have to
 
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
still in this act they would still have
 
01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.229 align:start position:0%
still in this act they would still have
to

01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
report whether they're Delaware
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
California West Virginia whatever they
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
would still have to report to the
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
recipient and and how many you know and
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
donating okay nice try though further
 
01:22:52.159 --> 01:22:54.149 align:start position:0%
donating okay nice try though further
questions

01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
so so the r it so the legal status it
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
sends up in line one RSA 304
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
so you're saying we could apply this to
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
other llc's formed in other
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
states no well the reporting under the
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
last the on line 27 when a limited
 
01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
liability contributes it has to provide
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
the recipient of the contribution with
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
the names and addresses of all
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
members so that's a campaign Finance
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
provision I don't think that it is a
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily a formation question which
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
is I think what representative Bay was
 
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
getting to it's it's a fine
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
difference it has to do with campaign
 
01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
Finance as opposed to LLC formation sure
 
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
I I'd be curri thank you Mr chair I'd be
 
01:23:57.310 --> 01:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
curious about the applicability I mean
 
01:23:59.870 --> 01:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
it'd be a good question to to understand
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State or attorney
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
general how you know whether or not
 
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's really
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
applicable um because I I mean I can see
 
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
it being
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
applicable right for New Hampshire but I
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
I can't I can't see and the and you
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
talked earlier about the enforcement
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
mechanism I would also find that
 
01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
challenging to to enforce in that
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
context I I think you just gave us our
 
01:24:29.709 --> 01:24:29.719 align:start position:0%
homework I Tred oh Lord okay further
 
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative rafter um yeah just one
 
01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
uh clarification I guess in lines four
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
and five going back to the allocation of
 
01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
the contributions it refers to allocated
 
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
as provided in RSA 6644 so that would
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
determine the allocations based on each
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
member's investments in the LLC okay
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
which is governed by the LLC
 
01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.550 align:start position:0%
which is governed by the LLC
agreement

01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay okay further question of the
 
01:24:59.390 --> 01:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
committee seeing now representative
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
qu I knew that was too easy I
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
tried thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Lane for taking my
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
question uh I understand your concern is
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
stated about uh I won't restate it but I
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
understand it how many instances are you
 
01:25:19.109 --> 01:25:19.119 align:start position:0%
aware of where an LLC has been used in
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
the fashion that that you oppose please
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
I will defer I know that I've read a lot
 
01:25:27.149 --> 01:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
of articles but I don't remember the
 
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
number but I'm going to defer to some of
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
the folks who are going to speak because
 
01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
they do know how many times I think
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
there's a Dunkin Donuts there's a law
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
there's a a law there is a law article
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
law review article that goes into depth
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
about how many times it's used and it
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
continues to be used thank you okay okay
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
further question of the committee now
 
01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
Lane uh next next up will be the person
 
01:25:54.109 --> 01:25:54.119 align:start position:0%
who will probably answer representative
 
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
zinc good morning again do I I'm a
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%

01:26:32.669 --> 01:26:32.679 align:start position:0%
talking about my testimony but maybe
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
give an example
 
01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:37.719 align:start position:0%
so representative Barry maybe decides to
 
01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
run for governor and I want to support
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative Barry and his goo notori
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
campaign and I and representative
 
01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:48.639 align:start position:0%
Brennan have a business that we own 50%
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
of and we give a $10,000 check to
 
01:26:57.070 --> 01:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
representative Barry 15,000 15,000 yeah
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
I want 15 well well we're going to do
 
01:27:00.990 --> 01:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
10,000 first right so representative
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
Brennan and I give $10,000 5,000 is
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
allocated to me 5,000 is allocated to
 
01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
Angela Angela personally gives
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
$10,000 to Barry that's her
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
$155,000 limit that's all she can give
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
if uh I don't know representative Mirad
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
and Angela have
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
another LLC that they want to give money
 
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
to representative Barry from She's hit
 
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
her limit so basically what this is
 
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
doing is ass signing people that
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
$15,000 cap that they C whether it's a
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
personal donation or an LLC donation if
 
01:27:40.109 --> 01:27:40.119 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan really wants to
 
01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
funnel $100,000 into representative
 
01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
Barry's campaign for governor she can
 
01:27:46.830 --> 01:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
just create a super pack and put
 
01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
$100,000 into a account right she
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to use multiple llc's to
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
funnel monies there's other ways that
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
that that she can get $100,000 to
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative Barry for his gorial
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
campaign um just saying I just use that
 
01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
as an example for a little levity in
 
01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
this comedy to just sort of talk about
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
what this is trying to do um and you
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
know when representative Barry runs for
 
01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
governor he might come for looking at
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.149 --> 01:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
um um so I just want to talk a little
 
01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
bit about the history of this I started
 
01:28:25.629 --> 01:28:25.639 align:start position:0%
looking at this when there was a $7,000
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
limit now it's a $115,000 limit so we've
 
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
increased the limits but we're still
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
seeing llc's break the law um I'm going
 
01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
to go back to
 
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
2010 where John Ste Stevens who was a
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
candidate in the primary received
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 from 30 limited liability
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
companies in two addresses one in
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and one in Massachusetts so
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
here's two out of state companies that
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
are funneling 100 ,000 into a campaign
 
01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
for governor and this is in 2010 mind
 
01:28:58.830 --> 01:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
you remember like campaigns weren't as
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
as expensive as they are now um I'm also
 
01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:03.639 align:start position:0%
going to use another example that on
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
August 18th uh 13 llc's at the same
 
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
address in Massachusetts gave gorial
 
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
candidate Kevin
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
Smith um nearly half of what Kevin Smith
 
01:29:18.910 --> 01:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
raised so
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
$324,000 in contributions from an LLC
 
01:29:26.350 --> 01:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
um there's also uh what representative
 
01:29:28.990 --> 01:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
Lang talked about is the $999,000 from
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
50 llc's which are also Dunkin Donuts
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
franchise and then there's also $55,000
 
01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
from donations in that two that same
 
01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:41.800 align:start position:0%
2010 um campaign from 11 addresses in
 
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
Newington and Yonkers New York which
 
01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
were Planet Fitness franchises so I want
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
to say that this is I used Uh Kevin
 
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
Smith and John Stevens in 2010 but the
 
01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
Democratic candidates use this too it's
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
not just Republican candidates for
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
Governor that use this it's used by both
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
sides both sides equally exploit this
 
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
loophole um Kevin landrian reported um
 
01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.070 align:start position:0%
loophole um Kevin landrian reported um
in

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:30:13.109 --> 01:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
2012 um this is my the favorite example
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
18639 LLC decking Atlantic 1720
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
and then there was all kinds of
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
different decking companies with
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
different numbers Associated giving
 
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
different amounts of money but there
 
01:30:33.149 --> 01:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
were 47 checks all associated with the
 
01:30:36.109 --> 01:30:36.119 align:start position:0%
82 Flanders Road um Westboro
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts apparently westbo
 
01:30:40.109 --> 01:30:40.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts got uh representative
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
Barry is where you want to go for those
 
01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:42.629 align:start position:0%
Barry is where you want to go for those
big

01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
big
 
01:30:42.639 --> 01:30:44.189 align:start position:0%
big
checks

01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
checks
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
um so um I also give an example of
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
um uh when uh Dan felt this ran for
 
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
governor in 2020 um a few different
 
01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
llc's that had funneled money into his
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
campaign so this is a fairly Common
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
Sense Bill you've seen past bills I
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
listed them there's a lot of times this
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
bill has been tried and I feel like it's
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
gotten better every single time it's
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
been introduced it's gotten you know
 
01:31:13.149 --> 01:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
worked out the Kinks so I think it's
 
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
ready uh for an a to pass so that we can
 
01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
close this loophole um finally and get
 
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
this uh behind us and happy to take any
 
01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:22.750 align:start position:0%
this uh behind us and happy to take any
questions

01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:22.760 align:start position:0%

1074 so please note that um I
 
01:32:28.719 --> 01:32:31.350 align:start position:0%
1074 so please note that um I
apologize

01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
um after reviewing the bill um I bring
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
forward a suggestion for a small
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the proposed bill um former
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
Representative Bob Perry um who's a
 
01:32:44.910 --> 01:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
former member of election law um
 
01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
actually brought this forth to my
 
01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
attention um in lines 6 12 16 22 and 26
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
the current bill cites RSA
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
6644 Section 5 as describing
 
01:33:02.189 --> 01:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
contribution limits um however that
 
01:33:05.109 --> 01:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
paragraph outlines contributions for um
 
01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
any candidate committee or political
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
advoc advocacy program as unlimited for
 
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
three phases um the paragraph of this
 
01:33:16.669 --> 01:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
paragraph four of the same RSA describes
 
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
contribution limits um for a person or
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
corporation uh that would place Total
 
01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
maximum contributions at $155,000 which
 
01:33:29.310 --> 01:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
was what we were discussing so my
 
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
proposition is that every mention to
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
section or paragraph five is just
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
changed to paragraph four um as I think
 
01:33:41.109 --> 01:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
it would uh fit the intention of this
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
bill more appropriately um otherwise I'm
 
01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
going to defer to my Superior elivia
 
01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:47.229 align:start position:0%
going to defer to my Superior elivia
zinc

01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
zinc
 
01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
who uh provided a significant amount of
 
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
context on the background for this bill
 
01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to take questions
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
though good catch
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
um other any questions from the
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
committee okay seeing none thank you oh
 
01:34:05.550 --> 01:34:05.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative
 
01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:08.870 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative
weary

01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
um so just Googling
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
6644 yeah uh section four was repealed
 
01:34:21.629 --> 01:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
and it is Section Five that talks about
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
so yeah so I'm
 
01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.629 align:start position:0%
so yeah so I'm
not

01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm a little confused with this
 
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
because it looks like Roman numeral 4
 
01:34:41.310 --> 01:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
has been repealed okay in the law and
 
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
that it is Section Five that talks about
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
although your comments about its
 
01:34:49.629 --> 01:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
applicability May pertain but I I
 
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
just Googled it and these things are
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
fluid as we know so absolutely that's
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
understandable but I just um you may
 
01:35:01.709 --> 01:35:01.719 align:start position:0%
want to provide an update or something
 
01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
to to that effect thank you yeah
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
definitely um I apologize if that was uh
 
01:35:09.790 --> 01:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
incorrect I had checked gen court and
 
01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:10.430 align:start position:0%
incorrect I had checked gen court and
the

01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
rsa's um kind of portal there the other
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
day so um yeah hopefully or I guess the
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
applicability still uh stands true in
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
checking and making sure we're citing
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
the right thing
 
01:35:25.149 --> 01:35:25.159 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate your time thank you
 
01:35:26.590 --> 01:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
okay further questions for the committee
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much last up is
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
Liz tantarelli from the New Hampshire
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
Voters good morning thank you for the
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my name is Liz
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
tenter trelli I'm president of the
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan League of Women Voters of
 
01:35:58.350 --> 01:35:58.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we have as part of our
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
mission campaign Finance reform so I've
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
been testifying on bills like this for
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
several years I do want to point out
 
01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
that in
 
01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
2019 Senate Bill 156 attempted to do the
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
same thing and it passed the house 212
 
01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.149 align:start position:0%
same thing and it passed the house 212
to

01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
139 uh um obviously passed the Senate it
 
01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
was one of the 57 bills however that
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
Governor sonunu vetoed that year when he
 
01:36:35.629 --> 01:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
was exercising his red pen and if I knew
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
how and if I had the time i' try to find
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
out how many of the governor's campaign
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
contributions came from multiple
 
01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
llc's but I don't know how to do
 
01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
that uh however I think there must have
 
01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
been sumon there um this bill does not
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
stop people from donating to candidates
 
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
of their choice but it does prevent
 
01:37:03.870 --> 01:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
wealthy influencers from create from
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
using multiple llc's to get around the
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance donation
 
01:37:13.709 --> 01:37:13.719 align:start position:0%
limits found an article last year where
 
01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
one member of the House publicly stated
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
I believe that money is speech and so
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to placing limits on that
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
well I'm not just because one person has
 
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
more money doesn't mean he should have a
 
01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:31.950 align:start position:0%
more money doesn't mean he should have a
louder

01:37:31.950 --> 01:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
louder
 
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
voice the property owner in town who
 
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
pays the most taxes for his Lakeside
 
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
estate still gets only one vote in local
 
01:37:46.270 --> 01:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
elections that's the way we think it
 
01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
should be and so this is a bill that
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
attempts to fix that in my testimony
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
second to the last paragraph I quote an
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
article from 2021 the conquered monitor
 
01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
at that time there were about
 
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
65,000 New Hampshire llc's in good
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
standing they constituted the vast
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
majority of New Hampshire business
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
entities except for the sole
 
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
proprietorships whatever they may be but
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
at least
 
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
75% of those LL C's had a single member
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
and 20% had only two members so that
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
means at least in theory in
 
01:38:37.149 --> 01:38:37.159 align:start position:0%
2021 60,000 people could have made
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
multiple donations above established
 
01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:43.719 align:start position:0%
donation limits I'm not saying they did
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
I think uh Miss zinc's testimony is more
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
accurate on that but this talks about
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
the possibilities so with that I urge
 
01:38:55.589 --> 01:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
you to support this Common Sense bill
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
that we have been looking at for years
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
if there are questions I can answer I
 
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
would be pleased to all right questions
 
01:39:04.109 --> 01:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative weing did the
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh article uh thank you Mr chair and
 
01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
01:39:13.589 --> 01:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony um in
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
the conquered monitor article did they
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
say whether or not they had done the
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
research as to finding duplicate
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
instances of owners of the
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
llc's um so there's they're saying that
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
this is the breakdown in the
 
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
demographics of single single member
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
llc's and multi-member llc's or two
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
member llc's but did they do their
 
01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
homework and actually distinguish that
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
there were multiple llc's because this
 
01:39:43.589 --> 01:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
is the this is the issue that I
 
01:39:45.629 --> 01:39:45.639 align:start position:0%
understand right so did they actually do
 
01:39:45.639 --> 01:39:47.950 align:start position:0%
understand right so did they actually do
that

01:39:47.950 --> 01:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
homework I'm sorry I can't answer that
 
01:39:52.589 --> 01:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
right right now I'd have to go back and
 
01:39:55.390 --> 01:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
dig up that article again I do give the
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
date and uh we might be able to find it
 
01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
so the date is in my testimony but right
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
now I can't answer that but thank you
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah uh just um for the record
 
01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
again could you please tell me the date
 
01:40:12.189 --> 01:40:12.199 align:start position:0%
of that article because I just
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
um uh as a single member LLC person um I
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
don't really I I hate to cast aspersions
 
01:40:23.070 --> 01:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
upon our llc's in New Hampshire I would
 
01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
do that yes of course not no I'm sure I
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
mean llc's are formed for numerous
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
reasons and you know I'm not denying
 
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
that that I'm not saying they shouldn't
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
exist this is solely about contributions
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
the date was November 15th
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
2021 in the conquered monitor thank you
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
very much I I just if I may for the
 
01:40:46.990 --> 01:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
record I have not formed an LLC for the
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
governor Barry campaign yet so uh the
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
emphasis there's yet um okay thank you
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you Mr
 
01:40:59.310 --> 01:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
tanelli that concludes our people are
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
our that concludes our public testimony
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
from those signed up to speak in person
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
online there were 70 in support and four
 
01:41:08.910 --> 01:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
opposed with that I will be closing the
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 1074 I'll
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
be immediately opening the house the
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
hear public hearing on House Bill um uh
 
01:41:22.589 --> 01:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
1 1119 relative to absentee ballots uh
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative prud home O'Brien is
 
01:41:25.709 --> 01:41:25.719 align:start position:0%
recognized representative O'Brien would
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
card and representative Lane will be
 
01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
valiantly good morning Mr chairman and
 
01:41:49.149 --> 01:41:49.159 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I always forget
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
the pink card when I'm in introducing a
 
01:41:53.070 --> 01:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
bill because it just seems so obvious of
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
course I'm going to be
 
01:41:59.470 --> 01:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
speaking so I'll get that yes um so I I
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
thought this was a
 
01:42:04.669 --> 01:42:04.679 align:start position:0%
rather boring bill in a
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
sense and it just simply addresses an
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
issue that came up in my community where
 
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
we did have the the winter storm in the
 
01:42:18.589 --> 01:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
uh Municipal
 
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
elections yet the the uh absentee ballot
 
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
request form did not have a section for
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
people to check off so there was some
 
01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
confusion when people didn't want to be
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
um dishonest about why they were
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
requesting this form uh requesting an
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and they didn't feel
 
01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
that they were that these things applied
 
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
to them I am elderly or infirm I have a
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
physical disability otherwise would I
 
01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
would vote in person but I have concerns
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
for my safety um
 
01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:52.629 align:start position:0%
for my safety um
[Music]

01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
traveling in the storm that seems to be
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
saying that they are elderly and infer
 
01:43:01.229 --> 01:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
infirm you don't you don't have to be
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
elderly or infirm or have a physical
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
disability to have those safety concerns
 
01:43:10.589 --> 01:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
uh in the storm or that you are caring
 
01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
for a child or an adult in need so this
 
01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
takes that section out and would simply
 
01:43:20.109 --> 01:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
add I would otherwise vote in person but
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
I have con concerns for my safety
 
01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
traveling in the storm and this is to
 
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
clarify um to go back a little bit that
 
01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
is when the national weather service has
 
01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
issued a winter storm warning blizzard
 
01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
warning or ice storm warning for
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
election day that is applicable in the
 
01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
city town or un Incorporated place that
 
01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
the person is residing in and requesting
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
in I just spoke to Secretary of State
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
scanland and he says that he signed in
 
01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
in favor on this bill and he like likes
 
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
the space saving um part of this bill
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
that it takes it although it adds it
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
does take away some of the um lines that
 
01:44:03.709 --> 01:44:03.719 align:start position:0%
are in there right now and it IT
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
addresses the issue so that that voters
 
01:44:07.390 --> 01:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
can feel that they're being completely
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
honest as they fill out this form and I
 
01:44:13.149 --> 01:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
I know that most voters and our state
 
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
would want that uh it there's an
 
01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:17.990 align:start position:0%
would want that uh it there's an
additional

01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
section that is added that says during a
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
a storm warning the Monday before an
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
election the clerk's office May remain
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
open later or otherwise extend its hours
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
I know that this is a concern in in my
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
community where we have many people that
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
are coming from out of town uh where
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
they work and voting you know
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
maybe um something that they want to do
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
after 5:00 p.m. and and if our town
 
01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
clerk would um be amenable to that um
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's what would they would they would
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
choose to do so if there are any
 
01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:55.639 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be happy to answer them
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
and I think we may have some other
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
people signed up so they can answer them
 
01:45:02.910 --> 01:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
as well question from representative
 
01:45:06.109 --> 01:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
Lane um thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative didn't we have this in
 
01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
here once before because I recall our
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
first year on the committee yes that we
 
01:45:18.430 --> 01:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
worked because there were two towns that
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
had this issue so was it taken out at
 
01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
some point and now we're trying to put
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
it back in or am I misremembering I
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
think you might be thinking about the
 
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
addition so so I'm on page two yeah and
 
01:45:34.510 --> 01:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
the part that would be taken out on line
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
one and two I'll read the whole thing I
 
01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
am elderly or infirm or I have a
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
physical disability and would otherwise
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
vote in person but I have concern for my
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
safety traveling in the storm maybe
 
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about when that was
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
added and I and what happened in in
 
01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
reality was that people felt they had
 
01:45:56.430 --> 01:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
concerns for their safety traveling in
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
the storm but they weren't elderly or
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
infirm and had a physical disability and
 
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to check that off
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
because they were otherwise healthy and
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
they just wanted to be really really
 
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
accurate and honest in why they were
 
01:46:12.589 --> 01:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
requesting an absentee
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
ballot and follow up yep um the top of
 
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
page two then the strike of that other
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
one is that not is that tied in or
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
because that's not really related to a
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
storm correct is it correct so this
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
would CLE clean that up and people could
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
simply write I would otherwise vote in
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
person but I have concerns for my safety
 
01:46:37.709 --> 01:46:37.719 align:start position:0%
traveling in the storm that's it the end
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
I mean you could have concerns for your
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
safety based on just traveling in the
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
storm you could have concerns because
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
you have to bring your children to
 
01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
school or to something or back from
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
school or all these things you're not
 
01:46:51.310 --> 01:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
this just makes it it more clear for
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
people and clarifies it so that they
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
feel that there's a spot it was also
 
01:46:57.629 --> 01:46:57.639 align:start position:0%
confusing when it's confuses the voter
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
to not have a spot that really applies
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
to them right I don't want that thank
 
01:47:04.109 --> 01:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
you yeah F questions from the committee
 
01:47:04.119 --> 01:47:05.350 align:start position:0%
you yeah F questions from the committee
representative

01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
Burnham thank you Mr chairman um so in
 
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
my town a few years ago there was a big
 
01:47:15.669 --> 01:47:15.679 align:start position:0%
storm and the town moderator chose to
 
01:47:17.950 --> 01:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
cancel against the wishes of the
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State I believe but it was
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
was quite a a bit of snow and uh for the
 
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
safety they they chose to cancel and
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
reschedule so when that happens um and
 
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
someone decides that they were going to
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
say this goes in and they decide to do
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot and then it's
 
01:47:38.229 --> 01:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
rescheduled and now they want to go in
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
physically do you see that as being um
 
01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
problematic thank you very much that's a
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
good question no I don't because there
 
01:47:49.950 --> 01:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
are procedures in place that would show
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
that the person has already voted
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
absentee for clarification you do have
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to if you have voted by
 
01:47:58.350 --> 01:47:58.360 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot to show up and remove
 
01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
your absente about I think before 10:
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
a.m. on an election day maybe noon um
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
but you there's a time frame to show up
 
01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
before election day to remove your
 
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
absente about if you've castone wish to
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
change it um further questions from the
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
committee representative qua uh thank
 
01:48:15.149 --> 01:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you representative
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
prome O'Brien uh this is more of a a
 
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
recollection regarding a a p bill that
 
01:48:25.229 --> 01:48:25.239 align:start position:0%
was just referenced we did pass a very
 
01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
similar Bill two years ago in the
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
previous bium uh which made it through
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
the house and then was uh altered
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
sufficiently in the other chamber of the
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
legislature that the house no longer
 
01:48:41.550 --> 01:48:41.560 align:start position:0%
agreed with it and if I if I may I'd
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
also like to point out that the uh
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
winter weather provision in the RSA
 
01:48:50.589 --> 01:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
itself that specifies the eligibility
 
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
makes no reference to whether you're
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
infirm or handicapped it just it uh so
 
01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
leaving that out of this application
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
would actually be in stronger agreement
 
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
with the uh the underlying irsa spelling
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
out eligibility so I can make this a
 
01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
question were you aware of that it's
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
hard to keep track of everything and I
 
01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification that
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
really helps thank you thank you
 
01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lane sorry um I um on
 
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
page one at 31 I I think that we we
 
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
don't need to check one because
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
you've you know there's only one so and
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
it says either and it says check one so
 
01:49:36.669 --> 01:49:36.679 align:start position:0%
I think it's
 
01:49:41.149 --> 01:49:41.159 align:start position:0%
just and so there's no choice to check
 
01:49:43.950 --> 01:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
so I think it just it's a typo I think
 
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
we could have an amendment that's always
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
fun thank you for giving me all that
 
01:49:50.109 --> 01:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
more extra work we could do that I
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to share the well since I had to
 
01:49:54.990 --> 01:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
I could tell you're a
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer only one to
 
01:50:00.589 --> 01:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
check okay further questions from the
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you
 
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
representative prom O'Brien got to give
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
me your pink card yes sir um Daniel
 
01:50:13.470 --> 01:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.350 --> 01:50:16.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have prepared uh that's fine
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
you can uh just bring it over there if
 
01:50:20.189 --> 01:50:20.199 align:start position:0%
anybody has prepared testimony uh huge
 
01:50:21.709 --> 01:50:21.719 align:start position:0%
pet peeve of mine is the distribution of
 
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
written testimony while somebody's
 
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
testifying it's like a huge pet peeve so
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
if you have written testimony do me a
 
01:50:29.629 --> 01:50:29.639 align:start position:0%
solid give it to representative uh
 
01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
anenberg at the beginning of the bill
 
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
hearing um and we will distribute it out
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
um and that way because I I find it very
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
disrespectful when people are doing this
 
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
one right while somebody's talking um
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%

01:50:46.990 --> 01:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
focus on you um so just just an FYI

01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
that thank thank you committee members
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me your time today
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh I want to address this issue I oppose
 
01:50:57.390 --> 01:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
this bill for a variety of reasons first
 
01:51:00.350 --> 01:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
of all lack of jurisdiction the state uh
 
01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
the state constitution is very clear it
 
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
was amended in 1942 specifically to
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
provide for absentee voting and within
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
that provision it provides the two
 
01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional exemptions the last time
 
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
I checked this body has never been
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
granted the ability to create a
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to an absentee
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
ballot it's it's a big deal it's in the
 
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court now and to courot to quote
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
chief justice Gordon McDonald on the
 
01:51:28.229 --> 01:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
29th of November when questioning the
 
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
state's attorney he asked the state's
 
01:51:32.109 --> 01:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
attorney permissible legislative
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
judgment please explain to me what that
 
01:51:36.669 --> 01:51:36.679 align:start position:0%
means because I don't understand how is
 
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
how is it permissible for the
 
01:51:40.270 --> 01:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
legislature to ask to exercise
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
permissible legislative judgment when it
 
01:51:43.629 --> 01:51:43.639 align:start position:0%
exceeds the authority of the
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution he was spot on what's
 
01:51:48.069 --> 01:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
happened recently just so that this
 
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee is aware the state on that
 
01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
same day the state supreme court cited
 
01:51:55.069 --> 01:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
morvi Harper morvi Harper is the
 
01:51:57.310 --> 01:51:57.320 align:start position:0%
redistricting fight that's now settled
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
so it's now settled in the state by that
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
Federal Supreme Court decision within
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
that body it specifically spells out
 
01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying to you this body is
 
01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
specifically limited by your Authority
 
01:52:10.510 --> 01:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
granted in the Constitution now we have
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
a bigger problem with absentee ballots
 
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to bring to your attention what
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
I handed out to the committee is
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
starting with article 11 the Bill of
 
01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
Rights the private rights of the people
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
within that scope is the Mandate for
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
this body to create the necessary
 
01:52:28.189 --> 01:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
statutes and rules and regulations to
 
01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
conduct your elections but remember
 
01:52:33.390 --> 01:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
whenever this body acts it acts with
 
01:52:36.069 --> 01:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
Federal oversight as well because you're
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
in concurrent jurisdiction the Article 1
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
Section 8 excuse me Article 1 Section 2
 
01:52:44.270 --> 01:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
says that the people of the several
 
01:52:45.790 --> 01:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
States shall elect their Federal
 
01:52:48.270 --> 01:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
representatives in Article 1 Section 4
 
01:52:49.870 --> 01:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
which is what morv Harper is all about
 
01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
about addresses that issue in great
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
detail so here's what I want to bring to
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
your attention what we don't have
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
happening right now who knows what an
 
01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.310 align:start position:0%
happening right now who knows what an
affidavit

01:52:59.310 --> 01:52:59.320 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
is you're an attorney right an affidavit
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
just for the record is a legal
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
instrument sworn before a public
 
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
official authorized by law to do so we
 
01:53:10.270 --> 01:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
currently have and have had since
 
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
absentee voting was created in
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
1942 a notary certificate requirement
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
and that currently exists in statute 659
 
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
colon 30 which says and I will quote
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
it and this is in the challenge voter
 
01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
section and by the way you can't
 
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
challenge it if it isn't properly
 
01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:30.629 align:start position:0%
challenge it if it isn't properly
notorized

01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
notorized
 
01:53:33.069 --> 01:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
affidavit the Affidavit of a challenge
 
01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
voter or asserting a challenge form a
 
01:53:38.109 --> 01:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
qualified voter affidavit we all know
 
01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
the qva or any other affidavit required
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
by elction
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
statutes it has to be sworn before an
 
01:53:49.149 --> 01:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
official authorized by law they give you
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
five people to do it in front of a
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
notary a JP the moderator the selectman
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
and the clerk those are all the the
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
prerequisites for that issue and it's
 
01:54:01.069 --> 01:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
not happening so when you get to step B
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
when the moderator checks the absentee
 
01:54:05.229 --> 01:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
ballots we have a huge problem step B
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
step B says that he shall I have to
 
01:54:09.310 --> 01:54:09.320 align:start position:0%
pause you there we have to keep
 
01:54:12.189 --> 01:54:12.199 align:start position:0%
testimony relative to the bill sure um
 
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
and I understand the argument you're
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
probably going to make about this is all
 
01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
absolute ballots it's all connected I I
 
01:54:20.109 --> 01:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
don't want I don't want this to turn
 
01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
into something off the bill so we got to
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
you got to stay focused on
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
hp19 uh 1119 I'm sorry to do that to you
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
but that's all right so flurry of cards
 
01:54:30.189 --> 01:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
come in so I'm I'm at the brink of
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
creating a Time rule for this bill so no
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
problem so the real issue is this if the
 
01:54:35.790 --> 01:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
state constitution authorizes this
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
committee to write rules and regulations
 
01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
for one that you are physically disabled
 
01:54:42.189 --> 01:54:42.199 align:start position:0%
and by the way when this first went into
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
effect you had to have a notary
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
certificate from your doctor so this
 
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
committee what I'm saying to you is is
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
well- intended as dealing with the snow
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
what did they do in 1784 they got to the
 
01:54:54.430 --> 01:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
polls on a
 
01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
horseback okay so let's put that in
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
context and you must look at the State
 
01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution the courts are very clear
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
both state and federal you have to look
 
01:55:04.669 --> 01:55:04.679 align:start position:0%
at the State Constitution and the
 
01:55:06.669 --> 01:55:06.679 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution as they were
 
01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
written at the time they were written
 
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
not in the modern era thank you any
 
01:55:14.069 --> 01:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
questions thank you yes any questions
 
01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
committee um okay thank you thank you
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
all right all right next up is Linda
 
01:55:32.189 --> 01:55:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
Durham morning thank you for your
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
time I'm here as a town moderator
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
representing myself not necessarily the
 
01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
town uh first of all I want to say I am
 
01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:47.639 align:start position:0%
totally in favor of this bill um I think
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh making sure that people have the
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
right right to vote in spite of
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
especially weather conditions that are
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
unexpected um is definitely
 
01:55:58.109 --> 01:55:58.119 align:start position:0%
necessary um I did want to bring up the
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
fact that there are some unexpected
 
01:56:02.669 --> 01:56:02.679 align:start position:0%
unexpected consequences which can happen
 
01:56:06.270 --> 01:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
because of this um our town had uh we
 
01:56:09.149 --> 01:56:09.159 align:start position:0%
held our election during the um you know
 
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
the date it was is um
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
prepared and we had no option to cancel
 
01:56:18.069 --> 01:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
it um our school would only let us use
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
the gym for that day and we have no
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
other building in our town which would
 
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
be able to handle the elections so we
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
went ahead we had um we had good um the
 
01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh fire department was going to pull
 
01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
their their truck around the back in
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
case we lost electricity so we had power
 
01:56:40.069 --> 01:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
the police and the fire were willing to
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know get all our pole workers coming
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
in we stripped down as much as we could
 
01:56:48.510 --> 01:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
but um again we were in very bad
 
01:56:52.350 --> 01:56:52.360 align:start position:0%
conditions and and uh as a result of the
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
totally proper we had more than 50
 
01:56:57.870 --> 01:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
people come in the day before so that
 
01:56:59.229 --> 01:56:59.239 align:start position:0%
they were able to do the absentee
 
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
ballots we put it out on Facebook
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
everyone come in on Monday before it
 
01:57:06.589 --> 01:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
starts so that we got as many votes as
 
01:57:09.149 --> 01:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
necessary or as we could we still had a
 
01:57:11.470 --> 01:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
turnout of over 300 people in the snow
 
01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
which was pretty amazing but the thing
 
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
we had to remember is um when we put in
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
for our ballots we saved we want this
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
many absentee ballots this many same day
 
01:57:25.950 --> 01:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
ballots okay in the statute if during an
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
election you run out of same day ballots
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
you can go ahead and use absentee
 
01:57:32.350 --> 01:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
ballots and just the clerk can you know
 
01:57:35.189 --> 01:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
cross off the absentee well we do not
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
have is the opportunity in an emergency
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
situation like this to just use same day
 
01:57:42.910 --> 01:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
ballots for absentee ballots in order
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
for us to do that we have to make copies
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
of those which as you know will not go
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
through an Acu vote machine so as a
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
result of this we had more than 50 AB
 
01:57:55.629 --> 01:57:55.639 align:start position:0%
extra absentee ballots with a paired
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
down staff in an
 
01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
emergency we got an incredible amount of
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
snow um and so it meant that our pole
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
workers were there an extra hour hour
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
and a half dealing with those I have
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
some great pictures of us going through
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
the snow getting the stuff back into our
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
cars to get to the town hall at the end
 
01:58:18.589 --> 01:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
of the night and it worked but the issue
 
01:58:18.599 --> 01:58:19.950 align:start position:0%
of the night and it worked but the issue
was

01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
um if we can use absentee ballots for
 
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
same day ballots there should be
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
something that says especially in an
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
unforeseen emergency we should be able
 
01:58:33.390 --> 01:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
to do the same so some towns get around
 
01:58:36.189 --> 01:58:36.199 align:start position:0%
this by saying they they put in extra
 
01:58:39.149 --> 01:58:39.159 align:start position:0%
they they order extra absentee ballots
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
versus same day ballots so they can do
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
that which I don't understand that's
 
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:45.560 align:start position:0%
some kind of a counting thing that now
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
you're skewing the numbers as to how
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
many absentee versus whatever
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
so basically um I just wanted to let you
 
01:58:56.709 --> 01:58:56.719 align:start position:0%
know I totally agree we should have this
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
but a simple thing of allowing that same
 
01:59:02.350 --> 01:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
day ballots can be used in in the space
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
of absentees if you run out especially
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
in emergency and all it would take is
 
01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
one extra line on the moderator's
 
01:59:12.069 --> 01:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
worksheet to say and right now we have
 
01:59:14.990 --> 01:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
absentees used as same day ballots you
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
could have same day ballots used as
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
absentee I know everyone's cringing
 
01:59:22.189 --> 01:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
about another line but this is simple
 
01:59:24.669 --> 01:59:24.679 align:start position:0%
simply an accounting error now a couple
 
01:59:27.310 --> 01:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
things may happen with the new um I
 
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
don't know how many people are still
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
going to be using the ACU votes after
 
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
this year um I know that you know we're
 
01:59:35.109 --> 01:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
anticipating new machines coming out
 
01:59:37.629 --> 01:59:37.639 align:start position:0%
which are which may not make any
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
difference in what type of paper is
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
being used but for those towns that that
 
01:59:45.629 --> 01:59:45.639 align:start position:0%
may not do that if we have an emergency
 
01:59:50.069 --> 01:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
like that I think um that you need to uh
 
01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there could be
 
01:59:54.589 --> 01:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
unforeseen consequences and hazardous
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
conditions which would impact the safety
 
01:59:59.790 --> 01:59:59.800 align:start position:0%
of the pull workers in such such a a
 
02:00:02.069 --> 02:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
thing everyone worked out great everyone
 
02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
came together but you know we were there
 
02:00:06.189 --> 02:00:06.199 align:start position:0%
for like an extra hour and a half at the
 
02:00:07.390 --> 02:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
end of the night trying to get
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
everything done and you know I had an
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
extra foot in my driveway by the time I
 
02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
got home luckily someone helped me get
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
on my driveway so um anyway that's
 
02:00:18.830 --> 02:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say but I wholly
 
02:00:22.589 --> 02:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
holy wholly uh support getting um the
 
02:00:25.229 --> 02:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
absentees um more expanded usage if
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
anyone has any questions questions from
 
02:00:30.189 --> 02:00:30.199 align:start position:0%
the committee see seeing none thank you
 
02:00:32.430 --> 02:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
so much thank you um just so you know
 
02:00:34.430 --> 02:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
the reason I was cringing is not uh on
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
their comment was because of the folds I
 
02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
was having folds flashback oh
 
02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:41.270 align:start position:0%
was having folds flashback oh
um

02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
um uh next up is Al uh uh bran
 
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
brandano did I do well did I get it
 
02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
right this time I I always go back and
 
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
it thank you for having me um my name is
 
02:01:02.510 --> 02:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
Al brandano I'm from Kensington New
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm speaking and opposed
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
to this
 
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
bill I'm against this bill for really
 
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
virtually four reasons one it's
 
02:01:12.310 --> 02:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
repugnant to the Constitution as you've
 
02:01:16.030 --> 02:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
heard uh Mr Richards a uh constitutional
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
scholar here in New Hampshire to speak
 
02:01:21.550 --> 02:01:21.560 align:start position:0%
to second the lack of the affidavit the
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
affidavit executed by a um a public
 
02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
official which has always been required
 
02:01:31.229 --> 02:01:31.239 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately has been taken off I
 
02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
think maybe by mistake on the on the
 
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
absentee voter envelope I think when
 
02:01:40.189 --> 02:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
they added all the pieces the new things
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
that they have added they knocked that
 
02:01:44.550 --> 02:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
part off so something to think about or
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
look at three um you're awarding
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
privileges to people
 
02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
that the special award there not fair
 
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
and equal treatment if someone can say
 
02:01:58.910 --> 02:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to show up today because
 
02:02:01.709 --> 02:02:01.719 align:start position:0%
of the weather and the weather doesn't
 
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
occur it's a whole problem with weather
 
02:02:08.109 --> 02:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
I mean it's almost making this a joke we
 
02:02:09.870 --> 02:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
can come for anything you check anything
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
on the absentee Bell at now and just
 
02:02:15.149 --> 02:02:15.159 align:start position:0%
come and show up or not show up so
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
special privileges are being awarded
 
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
here and fourth the Moder Ator already
 
02:02:22.510 --> 02:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
has the ability to stop an election or
 
02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
postpone an election there's no need for
 
02:02:27.790 --> 02:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
this it's already within the rsas it's
 
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
already within the power of the
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
moderator who really controls the
 
02:02:33.229 --> 02:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
elections thank
 
02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
you question from the committee
 
02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:35.950 align:start position:0%
you question from the committee
represent

02:02:35.950 --> 02:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
Brennan thank you Mr chair are you aware
 
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
that on line 28 of this bill um which
 
02:02:45.310 --> 02:02:45.320 align:start position:0%
remains unchanged in the
 
02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
rsas happens before the line where you
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
would check I would otherwise vote in
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
person but I have concerns for my safety
 
02:02:55.109 --> 02:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
traveling in the storm on line 28 of
 
02:02:57.310 --> 02:02:57.320 align:start position:0%
this bill it says for use only on the
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
Monday immediately prior to the election
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
I cannot appear at my polling place on
 
02:03:04.669 --> 02:03:04.679 align:start position:0%
Election Day because the national
 
02:03:06.550 --> 02:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
weather service has issued a winter
 
02:03:09.310 --> 02:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
storm warning blizzard warning or ice
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
storm warning for election day
 
02:03:13.470 --> 02:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
applicable to my city town or
 
02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:15.310 align:start position:0%
applicable to my city town or
unincorporated

02:03:15.310 --> 02:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
unincorporated
 
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
place are you aware that that restricts
 
02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
the use of this checkline to only when a
 
02:03:23.550 --> 02:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
National Weather Service when the
 
02:03:25.629 --> 02:03:25.639 align:start position:0%
national weather service has issued a
 
02:03:28.069 --> 02:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
specific kind of warning thereby
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
rendering this very limited
 
02:03:34.709 --> 02:03:34.719 align:start position:0%
acceptability for absentee ballots are
 
02:03:37.870 --> 02:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
you aware uh I just I have read it and
 
02:03:40.229 --> 02:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
the part that I have to challenge with
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
you is where in the constitution does it
 
02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
make any exceptions for weather it
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't so making it limited doesn't
 
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
make it
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
right further questions from the
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you next up
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
is Tina Guilford Guilford excuse me from
 
02:04:08.669 --> 02:04:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
you good morning committee uh my name is
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
Tina Guilford I'm the dairy town
 
02:04:13.679 --> 02:04:16.350 align:start position:0%
Tina Guilford I'm the dairy town
clerk

02:04:16.350 --> 02:04:16.360 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
02:04:22.030 --> 02:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
um this bill um 657 colon 4 creates the
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
form for applying for an absentee
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
ballot it uses references from RSA 657
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
colon 1 which is where the rules
 
02:04:39.430 --> 02:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
are 657 colon 1 part two is when the
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
national weather service has issued a
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
winterstorm warning blizzard warning or
 
02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
ice storm warning for election day
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
applicable to the city town or
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
unincorporated place
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
place it then gives you two choices in
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
the statute of RSA 657 colon 1 a a
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
person who otherwise would have voted in
 
02:05:01.629 --> 02:05:01.639 align:start position:0%
person but has concerns for his or her
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
safety traveling in the storm shall be
 
02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
considered absent for purposes of this
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
chapter and may vote absentee on the day
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
immediately prior to the election or B A
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
person who cares for children or infirm
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
adults who reasonably anticipates that
 
02:05:19.149 --> 02:05:19.159 align:start position:0%
school child care or adult adult care
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
will be cancelled who would otherwise
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
have voted in person but will be debed
 
02:05:25.069 --> 02:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
from voting by the need to care for
 
02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
children or infirm adults shall be
 
02:05:29.229 --> 02:05:29.239 align:start position:0%
considered absent for the purposes of
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
this chapter and may vote absentee on
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
the day immediately prior to the
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
election that's why there were two
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
choices on the
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
form however at some point in time that
 
02:05:43.109 --> 02:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
I am elderly or infirm or I have a
 
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
physical disability was added but that's
 
02:05:50.189 --> 02:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
not in 657 colon 1 and has caused a lot
 
02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
of confusion in our town in
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
March forms should match the
 
02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
statute so that is why this needs to be
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
fixed the other part of this
 
02:06:08.830 --> 02:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
bill um allows for the clerk to stay
 
02:06:10.830 --> 02:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
open in the case of a winter storm
 
02:06:14.589 --> 02:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
warning past 5:00 p.m. and that's
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
because as you can see on page three
 
02:06:23.229 --> 02:06:23.239 align:start position:0%
um line 21 it says as required by RSA
 
02:06:25.149 --> 02:06:25.159 align:start position:0%
652 colon
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
20 that
 
02:06:30.510 --> 02:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
RSA um requires whenever the election
 
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
laws require a filing with or an action
 
02:06:35.709 --> 02:06:35.719 align:start position:0%
by the official such filing or action
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
shall be performed before 5:00 in the
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon on the stipulated
 
02:06:44.189 --> 02:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
day so we would need permission in order
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
to stay open later and that's what this
 
02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
would give and and for us in Derry a lot
 
02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
of those people there was no snow
 
02:06:56.189 --> 02:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
falling on Monday the flakes didn't
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
start till about 4:00 a.m. the next day
 
02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
but the time to reschedule the election
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
is hard at 6:00 p.m. and we never know
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
which way the storms are going to go
 
02:07:12.669 --> 02:07:12.679 align:start position:0%
they told us that they
 
02:07:16.910 --> 02:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
expected somewhere between five to 8
 
02:07:20.350 --> 02:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
Ines total over the course of the
 
02:07:24.270 --> 02:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
day we got 16 in over the course of the
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
day so sometimes the winter storms are
 
02:07:29.149 --> 02:07:29.159 align:start position:0%
not correct sometimes they say there's
 
02:07:31.390 --> 02:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
snow coming and then no snow
 
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
comes so it's really really hard um
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
however we need the form to match the
 
02:07:41.709 --> 02:07:41.719 align:start position:0%
statute and that's all and if there are
 
02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Howard so
 
02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
on uh on page two uh line three uh we
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
are striking out the uh anticipation
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
that people would need uh to care for
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
their children uh or uh infirm adults do
 
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
you think that that uh that that section
 
02:08:05.870 --> 02:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
should remain uh in
 
02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
statute well this the section is in
 
02:08:13.229 --> 02:08:13.239 align:start position:0%
statute because that's 657 colon 1 um
 
02:08:16.069 --> 02:08:16.079 align:start position:0%
when I spoke to representative prud home
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
O'Brien my thoughts were to just strike
 
02:08:21.870 --> 02:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
the words in line one I am elderly or
 
02:08:24.189 --> 02:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
infirm and I have a physical
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
disability okay because that's that
 
02:08:29.950 --> 02:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
would match the statute in 657 colon one
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
all right awesome thank you so much
 
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
02:08:38.350 --> 02:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
B do you think thank you chairman thank
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question do you think
 
02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:43.559 align:start position:0%
the the weather and I believe in Darry
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
you did hold the election that day do
 
02:08:50.229 --> 02:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
you think that the weather affected the
 
02:08:52.109 --> 02:08:52.119 align:start position:0%
outcome of your
 
02:08:54.510 --> 02:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
election do I think it affected the
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
outcome no um very sadly we have very
 
02:08:57.280 --> 02:08:58.189 align:start position:0%
outcome no um very sadly we have very
low

02:08:58.189 --> 02:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
low
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
turnout in our local elections we have
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
19,000 voters and we normally get around
 
02:09:08.189 --> 02:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
1,800 voters we got about a thousand
 
02:09:11.549 --> 02:09:11.559 align:start position:0%
voters 300 of them voted an
 
02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
absentee and and most of those were the
 
02:09:14.079 --> 02:09:14.950 align:start position:0%
absentee and and most of those were the
day

02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
before um I don't know that it changed
 
02:09:19.149 --> 02:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
the outcome at all
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
but I follow it okay uh seeing no other
 
02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so much uh Liz
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
next thank you I'm Liz tentarelli I'm
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
president of the League of Women Voters
 
02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
and last year when town meeting March
 
02:09:48.030 --> 02:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
town meeting occurred on a blizzard day
 
02:09:51.629 --> 02:09:51.639 align:start position:0%
I uh eagerly the few days before started
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
alerting voters to this we used our
 
02:09:58.510 --> 02:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
Facebook page I boosted posts to explain
 
02:10:01.589 --> 02:10:01.599 align:start position:0%
the possibility of the early absentee
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
voting and I kept saying if a
 
02:10:06.750 --> 02:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
winterstorm warning is posted and then I
 
02:10:08.669 --> 02:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
updated it when that winter storm
 
02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
warning was was
 
02:10:13.149 --> 02:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
posted it's always interesting when you
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
boost something on Facebook to see what
 
02:10:18.750 --> 02:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
kind of responses you get and the one
 
02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
that I was most interested in is
 
02:10:24.030 --> 02:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who said yeah but you have to
 
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
be really really old to get this to
 
02:10:31.069 --> 02:10:31.079 align:start position:0%
apply to you I thought you know what's
 
02:10:34.990 --> 02:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
with what's with people who who think
 
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
that the only people who are endangered
 
02:10:39.549 --> 02:10:39.559 align:start position:0%
by trying to drive out in the snow are
 
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
really really old people now I don't
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
like to drive out in the snow and I may
 
02:10:46.910 --> 02:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
be really really old but that's not the
 
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
point it could could be just as
 
02:10:52.069 --> 02:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
dangerous for a perfectly hearty healthy
 
02:10:55.109 --> 02:10:55.119 align:start position:0%
young person to try to walk the two
 
02:10:57.069 --> 02:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
miles to the poles that they might
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise be able to do but their car
 
02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't like
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
snow uh you know you you can be in as
 
02:11:06.910 --> 02:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
much danger at age 25 as someone of my
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
age so I think getting rid of the
 
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
elderly and firm thing in here is very
 
02:11:16.589 --> 02:11:16.599 align:start position:0%
necessary um and I got really tired that
 
02:11:19.870 --> 02:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
year of arguing with people on Facebook
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
that look if you think it's too
 
02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
dangerous for you to get to the
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
polls you still have a right to vote go
 
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
do it the night before that's what we're
 
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get to to that basic right so
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
I urge support of this Bill thank you
 
02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.159 --> 02:11:54.270 align:start position:0%

Association uh I'm going to be brief we
 
02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
are in support of this bill I think
 
02:12:08.910 --> 02:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
these are uh some good changes uh that
 
02:12:11.629 --> 02:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
make it so uh more people can utilize
 
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
the absy uh ballot uh prior to the
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
election when there's going to be a
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%

dairy town clerk mentioned with last
 
02:12:32.629 --> 02:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
year's storm um was challenging for some
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
voters and at the time representative
 
02:12:37.750 --> 02:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
prud om O Brien stated that she would be
 
02:12:40.109 --> 02:12:40.119 align:start position:0%
proposing a change and I think this is a
 
02:12:44.069 --> 02:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
good change to um not disenfranchise
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
some voters that may not meet these
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%

zinc um good morning I'm Olivia zinc um
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
executive director for open democracy I
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
just want to quickly briefly mention
 
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
that Senate bill um
 
02:13:14.189 --> 02:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
535 which is going to the senate floor
 
02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
strikes the word I am elderly and or
 
02:13:19.470 --> 02:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
physically disabled exactly what Tina
 
02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
had requested um if the Senate passes
 
02:13:25.870 --> 02:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
this on Thursday you might want to think
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
about this version um and not pass this
 
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
version or retain this version or
 
02:13:36.910 --> 02:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
re-refer it um because um last year two
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
different versions passed and we lost
 
02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
both of them in Committee of conference
 
02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm just letting you all know that
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
02:13:47.470 --> 02:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
535 is a very similar bill um I really
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
want to thank the prime sponsor Kathleen
 
02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
prudo Brom Ryan for this bill I think
 
02:13:53.669 --> 02:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
it's very important um but I just wanted
 
02:13:56.030 --> 02:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
to also just let you know that another
 
02:13:58.350 --> 02:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
version very similar pass the Senate and
 
02:13:59.669 --> 02:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
you might want to just take a look at
 
02:14:02.030 --> 02:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take any questions
 
02:14:04.589 --> 02:14:04.599 align:start position:0%

south end I'm here to introduce House
Bill

02:16:01.950 --> 02:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
1133 um what this does is it allows uh
 
02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
uocava voters to email their absentee
 
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
ballot back in so we currently email it
 
02:16:13.790 --> 02:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
to them uh then they print it off and
 
02:16:16.109 --> 02:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
they have to mail it back to us um I
 
02:16:17.350 --> 02:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
would like to see some amendments to the
 
02:16:19.069 --> 02:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
bill we can go over that in executive
 
02:16:22.990 --> 02:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
session um but my intention here is to
 
02:16:24.750 --> 02:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
allow members of the military and their
 
02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
spouses and their dependant um to be
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
able to send their ballots back in in
 
02:16:31.470 --> 02:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
the same way in which they receive them
 
02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
um there are some situations where it is
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
not practical for a member of the
 
02:16:37.389 --> 02:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
military to mail their to print out and
 
02:16:38.709 --> 02:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
mail their ballot back in the most
 
02:16:39.990 --> 02:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
obvious one is if you're working on a
 
02:16:42.030 --> 02:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
submarine um really hard to get Postal
 
02:16:44.750 --> 02:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
Service underwater um so there are
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
examples of when this would um
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
when this would impact a military
 
02:16:52.830 --> 02:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
voter's ability to send their ballot
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
back in I would like to see some
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
curtailing of the bill um I I want it to
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
apply specifically to members of the
 
02:17:01.629 --> 02:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
military and their spouses Independence
 
02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to open up the world to
 
02:17:06.110 --> 02:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
mailing in absentee ballots um but I do
 
02:17:07.110 --> 02:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate if you're
 
02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
overseas serving our country or you're
 
02:17:10.990 --> 02:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
supporting your spouse who's serving our
 
02:17:13.549 --> 02:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
country that You' be able to send that
 
02:17:16.830 --> 02:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
ballot back in quickly um the other
 
02:17:18.589 --> 02:17:18.599 align:start position:0%
thing that we'll need to add address is
 
02:17:20.110 --> 02:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
it says via email is authorized by the
 
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State u in my kind of
 
02:17:24.589 --> 02:17:24.599 align:start position:0%
exploration of this bill one of the
 
02:17:26.110 --> 02:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
things I looked at was using an official
 
02:17:29.070 --> 02:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
doj email right so we know it's coming
 
02:17:30.429 --> 02:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
from the actual person that it was
 
02:17:32.070 --> 02:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
emailed to uh the other thing that we
 
02:17:34.830 --> 02:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
could obviously do is send it make it be
 
02:17:36.669 --> 02:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
have to come from the same email that we
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
sent it to so there's some work we need
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
to do on the bill but I I appreciate the
 
02:17:42.910 --> 02:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
and support the bill in concept um I
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
think it went through like two or three
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
revisions before I finally just told
 
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
alls sh ship it and we'll fix it um so
 
02:17:52.030 --> 02:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to take
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
02:17:54.639 --> 02:17:57.429 align:start position:0%
questions any
questions

02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
represa I think you addressed my
 
02:18:01.790 --> 02:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
question but I was going to ask you
 
02:18:04.750 --> 02:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
about any concerns with use an email
 
02:18:06.830 --> 02:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so you you you do you want to
 
02:18:08.190 --> 02:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that a little more or do
 
02:18:10.349 --> 02:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
you want to wait into wi session no no I
 
02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
I I my concern is pretty much as I
 
02:18:13.870 --> 02:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
stated right which is we have to be very
 
02:18:16.389 --> 02:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
careful with this um we don't want to
 
02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
open it up towards you know everybody's
 
02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
emailing their ballot back in across the
 
02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
state I'm a big fan of paper ballots um
 
02:18:24.389 --> 02:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
I've said that several times um however
 
02:18:26.030 --> 02:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
members of the military are different
 
02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
they're treated differently they're
 
02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
treated differently by the law um and I
 
02:18:31.230 --> 02:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
once again to go back to to the
 
02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
submarine example right there is if you
 
02:18:35.349 --> 02:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
are underwater for 45 days in a
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
submarine which is very possible you
 
02:18:39.030 --> 02:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
literally cannot get your ballot you
 
02:18:40.910 --> 02:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
literally cannot you literally cannot
 
02:18:42.429 --> 02:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
mail it back it is it is actually
 
02:18:43.549 --> 02:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
physically impossible unless you're
 
02:18:46.950 --> 02:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
going to give it to a dolphin so um
 
02:18:48.589 --> 02:18:48.599 align:start position:0%
those sort of situations I think we can
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
address um but the committee will need
 
02:18:52.349 --> 02:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
to be very careful in how we handle this
 
02:18:59.870 --> 02:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:02.790 --> 02:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
idea thank you my um my father was in
 
02:19:05.230 --> 02:19:05.240 align:start position:0%
the Navy and sometimes you would call
 
02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
ship to shore radio and I would talk to
 
02:19:10.509 --> 02:19:10.519 align:start position:0%
him um he's never on a
 
02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
submarine so I don't know how that works
 
02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
exactly is there email I I think that
 
02:19:19.509 --> 02:19:19.519 align:start position:0%
there is you need to ask somebody who's
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
in the military I am not um my I I
 
02:19:23.230 --> 02:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
believe that they do can they can get
 
02:19:26.469 --> 02:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
email but I could be wrong so I I think
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
we're already doing something
 
02:19:31.389 --> 02:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
to help I think that I'm looking forward
 
02:19:32.669 --> 02:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
to hearing from the Secretary of State
 
02:19:34.469 --> 02:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
on this yeah they can get the email they
 
02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
just because our current law require so
 
02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
we email it to them currently that's we
 
02:19:40.589 --> 02:19:40.599 align:start position:0%
currently do that what happens is they
 
02:19:42.429 --> 02:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
print it out they fill it out and then
 
02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
they mail it back that's the problem but
 
02:19:46.589 --> 02:19:46.599 align:start position:0%
they can't mail and there are situations
 
02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.429 --> 02:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
time any other
 
02:19:57.270 --> 02:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
questions done
 
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
weing so um would you alter the
 
02:20:04.429 --> 02:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
requirement to you know print it out and
 
02:20:06.990 --> 02:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
scan it back in or would you I mean that
 
02:20:08.030 --> 02:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
that that's what this bill does it
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
Alters the requirement to print it out
 
02:20:10.590 --> 02:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
and scan it back in and allows them to
 
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
send it back in
 
02:20:15.270 --> 02:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
electronically okay yeah so you would
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
have them fill out uh fillable flat file
 
02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
or yeah we'll have to work on it right I
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
think that's I think that's an executive
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's an exact question um you know
 
02:20:25.469 --> 02:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
it's I I do not believe the bill is
 
02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
complete as written um certainly doesn't
 
02:20:29.110 --> 02:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
address all of my concerns but it's I
 
02:20:30.910 --> 02:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a subject worth worth talking
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
about in the
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
committee yes uh just as a curiosity
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
were you aware that you know government
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
agencies such as the Food and Drug
 
02:20:42.270 --> 02:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
Administration take such forms like that
 
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
as a flat file oh fillable form and so
 
02:20:48.030 --> 02:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
you I mean for registering products and
 
02:20:49.469 --> 02:20:49.479 align:start position:0%
things like that oh yeah yeah I know
 
02:20:51.389 --> 02:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I definitely used this I mean I use
 
02:20:53.190 --> 02:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
this in my childcare setting right I
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
have a PDF that I send the parent and
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
they can just go through and fill
 
02:20:58.429 --> 02:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
everything out in and they can check a
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
little checkbox or not check a checkbox
 
02:21:01.469 --> 02:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
right there's definitely there
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
definitely ways that we can explore how
 
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
to do it we're going to have to we're
 
02:21:05.309 --> 02:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
gonna have to do have that conversation
 
02:21:07.150 --> 02:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
but there's definitely ways to do it I
 
02:21:10.349 --> 02:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
believe one more if please follow up
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh and there are also a lot of
 
02:21:16.030 --> 02:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh laws requirements and Technologies
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
around the concept of a of a digital
 
02:21:20.510 --> 02:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
signature or an electronic signature so
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
those would also apply in this case once
 
02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
again we'll have to have to sort all
 
02:21:26.910 --> 02:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
that out in exec um because right right
 
02:21:28.830 --> 02:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
now it says uh via email is authorized
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state which is very
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
broad um and as you know I'm I'm a big
 
02:21:36.750 --> 02:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
fan of ciling broad statements um so
 
02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
definitely a conversation worth having
 
02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:46.230 align:start position:0%
definitely a conversation worth having
thank

02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:51.389 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:21:51.389 --> 02:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.309 --> 02:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
thank you uh first I just want to say
 
02:21:56.590 --> 02:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
thank you to the sponsor representative
 
02:22:00.389 --> 02:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
Barry for um allowing me to co-sponsor
 
02:22:02.349 --> 02:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
this bill uh supporting our military is
 
02:22:04.750 --> 02:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan issue and I do believe that
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
is the intent of this bill and so I'm
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
grateful for that um I understand your
 
02:22:14.110 --> 02:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
concerns and wanting to um make some
 
02:22:17.469 --> 02:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
amendments and I'm just wondering if you
 
02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
might consider working together on
 
02:22:21.630 --> 02:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
amendments to make sure that this bill
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
remains a bipartisan Bill and that we
 
02:22:25.950 --> 02:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
can address the issues that you have
 
02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
seen and bring back something that can
 
02:22:32.030 --> 02:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
still remain a bipartisan Bill oh of
 
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
course I'm always willing to work with
 
02:22:38.910 --> 02:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
that that's why I be a great
 
02:22:44.230 --> 02:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
Governor appreciate your
 
02:22:46.590 --> 02:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
support okay saying no more questions
 
02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
than we have quite a few people who want
 
02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
to speak and represent bar could you
 
02:22:55.270 --> 02:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:59.190 --> 02:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
cart I thought that would get laugh next
 
02:23:11.070 --> 02:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:13.349 --> 02:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
scandin Secretary of
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
State um and I just want to offer some
 
02:23:20.830 --> 02:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
information uh on this particular Bill
 
02:23:22.830 --> 02:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh because I do have significant
 
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
concerns both in terms of the privacy of
 
02:23:28.990 --> 02:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
the ballot uh and the security of the
 
02:23:32.030 --> 02:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
transmission of the ballot uh I will
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
preface my remarks by saying that there
 
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
is no group out there uh that I would
 
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
like to be able to serve more than than
 
02:23:44.790 --> 02:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
you know our servicemen uh that want to
 
02:23:48.670 --> 02:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
vote using the uocava ballots
 
02:23:53.150 --> 02:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
we have a similar uh situation with
 
02:23:55.469 --> 02:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
individuals with site
 
02:23:58.630 --> 02:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
disabilities and the uh our office has
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
been involved in litigation uh related
 
02:24:04.510 --> 02:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
to you know how ballots are delivered
 
02:24:09.070 --> 02:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
and received from that group of
 
02:24:13.389 --> 02:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
individuals and we have uh settled that
 
02:24:16.429 --> 02:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
with an agreement that we would provide
 
02:24:19.269 --> 02:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh the ability to email ballots to
 
02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
individuals with site
 
02:24:23.710 --> 02:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
disabilities and we develop a program
 
02:24:25.510 --> 02:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
that that individual can use on their
 
02:24:28.870 --> 02:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
home computer where they can uh mark
 
02:24:33.870 --> 02:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
their ballot but they have to uh print
 
02:24:35.950 --> 02:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
it off and then mail it back to
 
02:24:38.590 --> 02:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
us part of that discussion was well
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
can't they just email it back and uh the
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
settlement in that uh litigation was
 
02:24:48.510 --> 02:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
that we would continue to monitor the
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
technology that's available to allow
 
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
that to
 
02:24:54.790 --> 02:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
happen to make sure the ballots remain
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
private and uh secure from hacking and
 
02:25:01.790 --> 02:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
things like that and we've engaged a an
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
expert in the field Harry hsty who some
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
of you may have heard of but he is
 
02:25:10.389 --> 02:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
a uh a former hacker I hope he's still
 
02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
not a hacker but uh turn consultant um
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
and we've utilized him in the past uh to
 
02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
great advantage and uh you we trust his
 
02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
judgment I will try and make available
 
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
to the committee the latest report that
 
02:25:27.269 --> 02:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
he has issued on this subject because
 
02:25:30.269 --> 02:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
you know uh part of the deal is that we
 
02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
get regular updates on the status of
 
02:25:35.710 --> 02:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
Technology uh to make this
 
02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:37.230 align:start position:0%
Technology uh to make this
happen

02:25:37.230 --> 02:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
so uh that's where we stand with that in
 
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
terms of the bill
 
02:25:46.269 --> 02:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
specifically uh there's a lot of there's
 
02:25:48.349 --> 02:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
a a lot in here that needs to be
 
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
resolved um uh you know it it it gives
 
02:25:55.150 --> 02:25:55.160 align:start position:0%
the broad authority to you know make
 
02:25:58.309 --> 02:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
this process happen uh with receiving
 
02:26:00.510 --> 02:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
ballots by email I would want to come up
 
02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
with a process uh that is transparent up
 
02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
front so that everybody knows how those
 
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
ballots are going to be handled uh I
 
02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
would want to see them handled to the
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
least degree possible with as few
 
02:26:17.790 --> 02:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
possible individuals uh seeing those
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
ballots so that we can maintain the
 
02:26:21.429 --> 02:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
privacy of them I'm not quite sure how
 
02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
that would work at the moment but uh
 
02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
that would be a great concern uh and
 
02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
then the other part of this is the
 
02:26:31.150 --> 02:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
technology that we we would use to
 
02:26:34.750 --> 02:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
receive these ballots and uh and
 
02:26:36.910 --> 02:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
properly treat them it may be
 
02:26:39.309 --> 02:26:39.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate to study this uh and I'd be
 
02:26:42.750 --> 02:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
happy to participate um in a study
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
committee and you know bring in the
 
02:26:46.469 --> 02:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
experts that we're using to help further
 
02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
just this
 
02:26:50.150 --> 02:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
discussion um but that's kind of where
 
02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
we're at at the moment so i' be happy to
 
02:26:52.830 --> 02:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
02:26:55.870 --> 02:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
questions any questions represent brenon
 
02:26:58.950 --> 02:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you are you aware of any other
 
02:27:02.510 --> 02:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
states that treat yava ballots um in the
 
02:27:05.070 --> 02:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
way that this bill proposes with
 
02:27:07.230 --> 02:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
submitting that completed ballot via
 
02:27:10.429 --> 02:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
email or a secure Dropbox or something
 
02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the like I'm aware that other states
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
do have programs I'm not familiar with
 
02:27:18.389 --> 02:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
how they work but I see that Warren
 
02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
Perry is here and he may be able to uh
 
02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
offer some more information in that
 
02:27:25.150 --> 02:27:25.160 align:start position:0%
regard we'd certainly be happy to look
 
02:27:26.750 --> 02:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
at and see how other states are dealing
 
02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
with this followup
 
02:27:34.269 --> 02:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
please um would it be your advice that
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
if we are to amend this bill that the
 
02:27:40.230 --> 02:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps that the effective date would
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
provide you a little bit of time to
 
02:27:46.030 --> 02:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
figure out how other states are doing it
 
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that Granite State military
 
02:27:50.910 --> 02:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
service members have the same
 
02:27:52.510 --> 02:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity that they are that is
 
02:27:54.910 --> 02:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
available to them in other states
 
02:27:56.910 --> 02:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
certainly delaying it would give us you
 
02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
know more time to come up with a plan
 
02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:03.070 align:start position:0%
know more time to come up with a plan
thank

02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:07.150 --> 02:28:07.160 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you Mr secretary um would
 
02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
it be necessary in the bill to go
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
through all the technology and all the
 
02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
details of all that or is that something
 
02:28:18.190 --> 02:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
that might be best left to your office
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
or someone else because you know we
 
02:28:23.710 --> 02:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
write it and probably 18 months after we
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
write it it's going to be you know out
 
02:28:26.479 --> 02:28:28.750 align:start position:0%
write it it's going to be you know out
of

02:28:28.750 --> 02:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:32.190 --> 02:28:32.200 align:start position:0%
date we we're rapidly advancing the
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
technology that we have in the
 
02:28:37.030 --> 02:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
department we don't have the expertise
 
02:28:39.550 --> 02:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
to really look at the techn
 
02:28:41.790 --> 02:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
technological components and so we have
 
02:28:45.190 --> 02:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
to rely on other sources for that and
 
02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
first instance is we look look at the
 
02:28:49.110 --> 02:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
standards that's the that the that the
 
02:28:51.630 --> 02:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
federal election assistance commission
 
02:28:54.070 --> 02:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
is setting for the different types of
 
02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
Technology that's out there and then we
 
02:28:59.269 --> 02:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
look to National Certified National
 
02:29:01.710 --> 02:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
Laboratories you know that can look at
 
02:29:04.389 --> 02:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
the inner workings of computer code and
 
02:29:06.750 --> 02:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
and Technology to you know give the
 
02:29:08.030 --> 02:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
approval on whether it's actually
 
02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:15.269 --> 02:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
different follow up just make sure that
 
02:29:17.750 --> 02:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
I understood so
 
02:29:20.349 --> 02:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
we could we don't have to lay out the
 
02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
very detailed technological pieces in do
 
02:29:26.070 --> 02:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
and all that in the statute we just need
 
02:29:28.670 --> 02:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the correct standards
 
02:29:31.349 --> 02:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
are perhaps referenced or something like
 
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
that it would be helpful to recognize
 
02:29:36.990 --> 02:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
you know whichever agency sets the
 
02:29:39.870 --> 02:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
standards for this I I think the the
 
02:29:42.030 --> 02:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
part that we would be most concerned
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
about is what is the process going to be
 
02:29:47.269 --> 02:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
for receiving
 
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
right you know the return ballots how
 
02:29:52.030 --> 02:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
are we going to you know get that
 
02:29:54.269 --> 02:29:54.279 align:start position:0%
information to the cities and towns how
 
02:29:56.190 --> 02:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
is it going to be dealt with at the
 
02:29:58.750 --> 02:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
local level um you know and those are
 
02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
all an unanswered questions at this
 
02:30:05.469 --> 02:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
point okay thank you represent Brant
 
02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking my
 
02:30:10.110 --> 02:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
question have you ever heard from
 
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
someone who said I wanted to vote but I
 
02:30:14.309 --> 02:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
was on a sub for more than 45 days and I
 
02:30:17.110 --> 02:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
was unable to do so
 
02:30:19.150 --> 02:30:19.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not recalling a conversation like
 
02:30:20.670 --> 02:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
that but that's not to say that it
 
02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:21.710 align:start position:0%
that but that's not to say that it
hasn't

02:30:21.710 --> 02:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
hasn't
 
02:30:26.750 --> 02:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:30.110 --> 02:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
up do you know of other states doing
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
something similar to this specifically
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
to help uh military members overseas I
 
02:30:38.510 --> 02:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
am aware that other states what are they
 
02:30:40.510 --> 02:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
doing yes I I couldn't tell you which
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
ones but as I mentioned Warren Perry is
 
02:30:45.670 --> 02:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
here um and he may be able to answer
 
02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
that question
 
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
and he's next represent where we got
 
02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
limit questions
 
02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
here so if if our if in
 
02:30:58.990 --> 02:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
the bill we we simply
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
limited the attributes to secure
 
02:31:05.630 --> 02:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
transmission and authentication of
 
02:31:08.230 --> 02:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
the of the individual submitting the
 
02:31:11.950 --> 02:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
vote would that be sufficient or give
 
02:31:15.630 --> 02:31:15.640 align:start position:0%
you sufficient leeway to Institute the
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
Technologies appropriate to fulfill
 
02:31:23.950 --> 02:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:26.110 --> 02:31:26.120 align:start position:0%
characteristics if you want to implement
 
02:31:28.910 --> 02:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
this sooner rather than later then I
 
02:31:30.590 --> 02:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
think you would have to give broad
 
02:31:34.349 --> 02:31:34.359 align:start position:0%
discretion to the Secretary of State to
 
02:31:36.990 --> 02:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh handle this and if you're asking me
 
02:31:38.910 --> 02:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
how I would handle it you know I would
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
want to have a a limited
 
02:31:42.960 --> 02:31:44.590 align:start position:0%
want to have a a limited
secure

02:31:44.590 --> 02:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
secure
 
02:31:47.150 --> 02:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
transmission probably to one
 
02:31:50.910 --> 02:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
one uh you know receiving point in this
 
02:31:52.469 --> 02:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
country because these ballots would be
 
02:31:55.990 --> 02:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
coming from all over the world and then
 
02:31:57.429 --> 02:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
we would have to figure out a way to
 
02:31:59.550 --> 02:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
disseminate you know from the Secretary
 
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
of State's office how do we get that
 
02:32:05.469 --> 02:32:05.479 align:start position:0%
information uh to the polling places so
 
02:32:07.429 --> 02:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
that those ballots can be counted on the
 
02:32:10.150 --> 02:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
day of the election
 
02:32:12.389 --> 02:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
um I think it's going to take some
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
thought to figure that out but that that
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
I think that would be the quickest way
 
02:32:18.990 --> 02:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
to get this up and
 
02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
running followup last
 
02:32:24.590 --> 02:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
one so
 
02:32:28.349 --> 02:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
um are would you be comfortable with the
 
02:32:30.590 --> 02:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office being
 
02:32:32.750 --> 02:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for the authentication of
 
02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:35.429 align:start position:0%
responsible for the authentication of
the

02:32:35.429 --> 02:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
voter I think we could do that yes okay
 
02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:40.630 align:start position:0%
voter I think we could do that yes okay
thank

02:32:40.630 --> 02:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:32:44.429 --> 02:32:44.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you seeing no more questions
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your test Tony and
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
we'll be working next on the list is
 
02:32:53.670 --> 02:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
with who you mentioned is Warren
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
Perry of the military Affairs and
 
02:32:57.120 --> 02:33:01.710 align:start position:0%
Perry of the military Affairs and
veteran

02:33:01.710 --> 02:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
services good morning Mr chair I didn't
 
02:33:05.630 --> 02:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
know that the secretary was GNA throw me
 
02:33:07.630 --> 02:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
under the bus this morning so I'm happy
 
02:33:09.710 --> 02:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
to be here but uh uh Mr chair members of
 
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Warren Perry
 
02:33:12.269 --> 02:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
I'm the deputy agitant general for New
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Department of military
 
02:33:15.269 --> 02:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran services in that
 
02:33:17.790 --> 02:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
role we service we uh are responsible
 
02:33:19.150 --> 02:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
for the administration of the National
 
02:33:20.990 --> 02:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
Guard both the Army and the air the
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
division of veteran services the Veteran
 
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
Cemetery and the Division of Community
 
02:33:25.950 --> 02:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
Based military programs the department
 
02:33:27.950 --> 02:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
supports the bill uh I don't need to say
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
more than that I think anything we can
 
02:33:31.550 --> 02:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
do to make it easier for our military
 
02:33:34.230 --> 02:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
members who are not in country for
 
02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
whatever reason to vote the the better
 
02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
off we are I mean it's just it's just
 
02:33:40.510 --> 02:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
that simple to address the questions
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
that uh that were asked unfortunately I
 
02:33:43.830 --> 02:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
don't know which other states have these
 
02:33:46.550 --> 02:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
kind of uh bills or these kind of
 
02:33:48.110 --> 02:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
processes but I'm sure that the other
 
02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
ones do and they manage it appropriately
 
02:33:52.110 --> 02:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
to to get this done but it is important
 
02:33:55.230 --> 02:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
you know having been overseas uh as a
 
02:33:56.990 --> 02:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
family member when my dad was stationed
 
02:33:59.710 --> 02:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
overseas or you know as a as an army
 
02:34:01.830 --> 02:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
officer you know whether I was in Saudi
 
02:34:04.429 --> 02:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
Arabia or Germany or wherever it is the
 
02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
ability to vote is probably one of the
 
02:34:08.190 --> 02:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
most important things that we can do
 
02:34:10.230 --> 02:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
whether you're in the service or not so
 
02:34:12.030 --> 02:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
I would say that I will tell you that
 
02:34:13.910 --> 02:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
that people are in places where they
 
02:34:15.870 --> 02:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
don't have access to printers you know
 
02:34:18.910 --> 02:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
and Christmas day in 2008 you know I
 
02:34:20.590 --> 02:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
flew in a helicopter out to the marshes
 
02:34:23.349 --> 02:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
in Iraq to deliver you know to deliver
 
02:34:24.670 --> 02:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
Christmas cheer and those folks just
 
02:34:26.670 --> 02:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
didn't have printers uh but they did
 
02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
have access occasionally to email so
 
02:34:29.950 --> 02:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
that they could get that done and they
 
02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
can uh they can do that I'm sure you
 
02:34:34.190 --> 02:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
know with all the technology we have in
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
submarines I guarantee that they can get
 
02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
an email every now and then I'm pretty
 
02:34:40.870 --> 02:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
sure so so subject to any questions you
 
02:34:44.429 --> 02:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
might have I'll just uh end my statement
 
02:34:48.309 --> 02:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
okay any questions good thank you and
 
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
question could you get us information as
 
02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
to what other states are doing I can
 
02:34:54.670 --> 02:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
work through that I mean generally we
 
02:34:56.590 --> 02:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
don't deal too much in that but I we'll
 
02:34:58.349 --> 02:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
take a look and I'll and I'll do my best
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
to get what I can work through the
 
02:35:01.389 --> 02:35:01.399 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office I'll return
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:08.910 --> 02:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
secretary okay thank you next person and
 
02:35:10.950 --> 02:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
let's try to keep things short and keep
 
02:35:13.269 --> 02:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
the questions limited and I will limit
 
02:35:27.070 --> 02:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:30.750 --> 02:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
right Kathy Holmes from Chai Chester I
 
02:35:33.630 --> 02:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
am the campaign manager of your friend
 
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative Clayton wood but I'm
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself so um I remember the
 
02:35:43.389 --> 02:35:43.399 align:start position:0%
20120 election when President Clinton
 
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
was the one and uh the leader up to that
 
02:35:50.670 --> 02:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
the um the military bases places of
 
02:35:53.830 --> 02:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
voting they were were shut down so that
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
they would have to use that APO address
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
that all goes to Florida and that was
 
02:36:00.469 --> 02:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
the choke point all these military
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
ballots uh waiting there in Florida to
 
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
be counted also the mail on the ships at
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
Sea submarines or ships they that was
 
02:36:11.630 --> 02:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
not being picked up their ballots were
 
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
there waiting to be picked up they were
 
02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
never picked up until of after the
 
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
election and when that time passed every
 
02:36:24.269 --> 02:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
they were checking for dented Chads oh
 
02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh which was a form of ballot stuffing
 
02:36:30.269 --> 02:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
the the military ballots were sitting
 
02:36:33.790 --> 02:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
there not being counted so oh I'm in
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
support of this bill in case you
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't figure it
 
02:36:40.309 --> 02:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
out questions thank you any
 
02:36:43.950 --> 02:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you next is Liz
 
02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:53.990 align:start position:0%
questions thank you next is Liz
tantarelli

02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:57.030 --> 02:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
hi Liz torelli from Newbury speaking
 
02:36:59.429 --> 02:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
personally as the mother of a son who
 
02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
has worked for the federal department of
 
02:37:05.269 --> 02:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
justice for almost 20 years um and I'm
 
02:37:08.110 --> 02:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill my son served a
 
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
year in Iraq a year in Afghanistan and
 
02:37:13.950 --> 02:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
almost a year in Yemen just before
 
02:37:16.269 --> 02:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
everything fell apart in Yemen and they
 
02:37:19.150 --> 02:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
had to evacuate everyone so as
 
02:37:22.910 --> 02:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice he is not military
 
02:37:25.670 --> 02:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
but he does have the same issues of
 
02:37:28.469 --> 02:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
voting when he was in Yemen they
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
received Courier mail only every three
 
02:37:34.710 --> 02:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
weeks he wanted to vote but when at the
 
02:37:36.870 --> 02:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
time when the ballot would have been
 
02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
time when the ballot would have been
sent

02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
sent
 
02:37:41.070 --> 02:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
out it didn't tie in with that 3-week
 
02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
cycle so I support the bill but I hope
 
02:37:46.429 --> 02:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
somebody can tell representative Barry
 
02:37:49.110 --> 02:37:49.120 align:start position:0%

02:37:51.110 --> 02:37:51.120 align:start position:0%

Massachusetts but I'm here at today on
 
02:39:42.550 --> 02:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
behalf of common cause and our more than
 
02:39:45.349 --> 02:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
8,500 members here in the granite state
 
02:39:47.590 --> 02:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
I'm actually appearing in opposition to
 
02:39:49.269 --> 02:39:49.279 align:start position:0%
this bill and let me give you some
 
02:39:51.950 --> 02:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
background on why uh New Hampshire to
 
02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
date has not joined all of the other
 
02:39:56.750 --> 02:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
states that have implemented some kind
 
02:39:59.150 --> 02:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
of electronic ballot return I'm very
 
02:40:01.269 --> 02:40:01.279 align:start position:0%
happy that New Hampshire has not joined
 
02:40:03.630 --> 02:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
the bandwagon because it is not
 
02:40:05.469 --> 02:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
something that technically can be done
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
safely right now I will get to you this
 
02:40:10.870 --> 02:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon I will get to you a bulletin a
 
02:40:12.830 --> 02:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
security bulletin issued by four federal
 
02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
agencies that says that even with all of
 
02:40:17.389 --> 02:40:17.399 align:start position:0%
the possible mitigations electronic
 
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
ballot return is high risk you're
 
02:40:21.269 --> 02:40:21.279 align:start position:0%
risking the voter's in personal
 
02:40:22.710 --> 02:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
information you're risking that the
 
02:40:24.510 --> 02:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
ballots could be changed in
 
02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
transit and there's no way to actually
 
02:40:29.150 --> 02:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
guarantee that what is sent from
 
02:40:32.349 --> 02:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
wherever it's sent from is what is
 
02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
received um I'd like to give you some
 
02:40:36.030 --> 02:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
background on how all of these other
 
02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
states came to be uh allowing all of
 
02:40:42.550 --> 02:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
this between 2010 pardon me between 2000
 
02:40:44.830 --> 02:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
and 2010 the Department of Defense was
 
02:40:47.429 --> 02:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
trying to create create a system that
 
02:40:49.190 --> 02:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
would allow for the secure electronic
 
02:40:51.269 --> 02:40:51.279 align:start position:0%
return of ballots they could not do that
 
02:40:53.190 --> 02:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
they could not do that successfully so
 
02:40:54.429 --> 02:40:54.439 align:start position:0%
during the time that they were working
 
02:40:57.230 --> 02:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
on it lots of State P States passed laws
 
02:40:59.670 --> 02:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
allowing for electronic ballot return
 
02:41:01.630 --> 02:41:01.640 align:start position:0%
and they haven't rescinded them yet
 
02:41:03.349 --> 02:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that the DoD said we
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
can't do this safely they have not
 
02:41:06.950 --> 02:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
rescinded the laws
 
02:41:10.750 --> 02:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
yet um I am going to get you the federal
 
02:41:14.429 --> 02:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
agency uh risk assessment uh later today
 
02:41:16.990 --> 02:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
I will also get you some testimony from
 
02:41:18.790 --> 02:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
one of our partner
 
02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:20.349 align:start position:0%
one of our partner
organizations

02:41:20.349 --> 02:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
02:41:25.150 --> 02:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
um and uh there are ways I we we are
 
02:41:28.110 --> 02:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
very aware of the obstacles that people
 
02:41:30.590 --> 02:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
overseas particularly the military we
 
02:41:32.269 --> 02:41:32.279 align:start position:0%
are aware of the obstacles that people
 
02:41:34.990 --> 02:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
face returning the ballots but there are
 
02:41:37.389 --> 02:41:37.399 align:start position:0%
programs through the federal voter
 
02:41:39.269 --> 02:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
assistance program through the EAC there
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
are programs that can help them that do
 
02:41:44.429 --> 02:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
not risk the security or privacy of the
 
02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
ballot when I talk about the security of
 
02:41:49.670 --> 02:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
the ballot I just want you to keep in
 
02:41:52.030 --> 02:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
the back of your mind what happens if
 
02:41:53.630 --> 02:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
electronic ballots the number of
 
02:41:55.510 --> 02:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
electronic ballots that cannot be
 
02:41:57.590 --> 02:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
verified they cannot be audited they are
 
02:41:59.910 --> 02:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
not secure they're not certain what
 
02:42:01.950 --> 02:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
happens if that number
 
02:42:05.070 --> 02:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
exceeds the margin of victory in a race
 
02:42:07.030 --> 02:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
here in the granite
 
02:42:10.389 --> 02:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
state if you have thousands of
 
02:42:13.349 --> 02:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
questionable ballots you've got five
 
02:42:17.710 --> 02:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
you've got about 15 thousand uh yava and
 
02:42:19.269 --> 02:42:19.279 align:start position:0%
Military voters right now if you have
 
02:42:21.070 --> 02:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
15,000 ballots that are returned
 
02:42:23.550 --> 02:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
electronically and you are not sure if
 
02:42:25.469 --> 02:42:25.479 align:start position:0%
those are the same ballots that were
 
02:42:29.670 --> 02:42:29.680 align:start position:0%

first time sir
 
02:43:17.309 --> 02:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
um and I want to thank you for the
 
02:43:19.190 --> 02:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide testimony today
 
02:43:22.269 --> 02:43:22.279 align:start position:0%
on behalf of secur democracy um I just
 
02:43:24.030 --> 02:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to let the committee know I did
 
02:43:26.510 --> 02:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
send all of you an email ncsl does have
 
02:43:28.590 --> 02:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
a list of all of the states that I
 
02:43:30.670 --> 02:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
believe representative Brennan was
 
02:43:33.230 --> 02:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
looking at uh that lists all the states
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
that and how they do electronic ballot
 
02:43:39.870 --> 02:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
return um about 27 states allow it via
 
02:43:42.429 --> 02:43:42.439 align:start position:0%
email currently the rest offer a
 
02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
combination of facts and or portal um
 
02:43:48.110 --> 02:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
this I want to make clear does not
 
02:43:51.389 --> 02:43:51.399 align:start position:0%
require a service member to return their
 
02:43:54.389 --> 02:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
ballot electronically it is an option
 
02:43:57.590 --> 02:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
that they have so if they know they're
 
02:43:59.469 --> 02:43:59.479 align:start position:0%
returning their ballot electronically
 
02:44:02.070 --> 02:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
they also know that their privacy on
 
02:44:04.309 --> 02:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
that ballot is likely to be reduced that
 
02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
is a choice that they are making um so I
 
02:44:09.870 --> 02:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
think we want to keep that in mind um
 
02:44:11.630 --> 02:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
also we want to make sure that New
 
02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire service members Independents
 
02:44:15.630 --> 02:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
are able to have their votes counted
 
02:44:17.830 --> 02:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
right now if they don't meet the window
 
02:44:21.309 --> 02:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
for mail by 5:00 on Election Day their
 
02:44:23.269 --> 02:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
votes aren't counted at all and these
 
02:44:24.950 --> 02:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
folks are probably some of the most
 
02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
important folks who should have that
 
02:44:29.510 --> 02:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
option to vote and I want to make sure
 
02:44:31.349 --> 02:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
this is not an expansive bill this is
 
02:44:33.469 --> 02:44:33.479 align:start position:0%
not open it to everyone it is a very
 
02:44:37.230 --> 02:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
specific group um one of thing I did
 
02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
want to address is I know there's a lot
 
02:44:41.269 --> 02:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
to talk about submarines that's not the
 
02:44:44.950 --> 02:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
only option or potential conflict a lot
 
02:44:47.070 --> 02:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
of service members right now especially
 
02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
are in active hostile fire situations
 
02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
and mail is not regular so they can't
 
02:44:53.349 --> 02:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they will get their
 
02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
ballots let alone be able to return them
 
02:44:57.870 --> 02:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
in the amount of time that they have I'm
 
02:45:01.269 --> 02:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions um and happy
 
02:45:02.469 --> 02:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
to assist in
 
02:45:05.309 --> 02:45:05.319 align:start position:0%

Association um we uh don't have a a
 
02:45:38.110 --> 02:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
stance on this bill I just here to offer
 
02:45:41.190 --> 02:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
some testimony um everything that
 
02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State scanland uh has said
 
02:45:46.110 --> 02:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
uh that's kind kind of our uh
 
02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee's thoughts on on this uh Bill
 
02:45:53.389 --> 02:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
too uh we have some concerns with how
 
02:45:55.910 --> 02:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
the voters how these uaba voters are
 
02:45:58.830 --> 02:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
going to get their ballots back to us um
 
02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know which email will they send it
 
02:46:03.150 --> 02:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
to I don't want it just going so say
 
02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
someone in my office sent them the
 
02:46:08.030 --> 02:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
request form just going to um anyone in
 
02:46:10.110 --> 02:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
the office so I think maybe funnel
 
02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
through the Secretary of State or
 
02:46:15.150 --> 02:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
another email might be a good idea um
 
02:46:17.070 --> 02:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
currently now when we get absentee
 
02:46:20.710 --> 02:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
requests uh through email sometimes they
 
02:46:23.110 --> 02:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh use you know their their phone and
 
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
they take a picture and it's way over
 
02:46:26.469 --> 02:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
here and you get all this other stuff in
 
02:46:29.389 --> 02:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
the background I'm concerned about that
 
02:46:33.469 --> 02:46:33.479 align:start position:0%
with the B being emailed back um so
 
02:46:35.830 --> 02:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
those are our main issues just the
 
02:46:37.670 --> 02:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
quality of the ball we're going to get
 
02:46:39.910 --> 02:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
back is you know going to be in Focus so
 
02:46:41.309 --> 02:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
we going to be able to read it we're
 
02:46:43.269 --> 02:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
concerned about the privacy of the voter
 
02:46:46.269 --> 02:46:46.279 align:start position:0%
but again they would um um they would be
 
02:46:48.670 --> 02:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
waving that option to privacy there's if
 
02:46:51.190 --> 02:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
I get an email my on my computer with
 
02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
the attachment I'm going to be seeing
 
02:46:54.670 --> 02:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
how they vote as much as I'm trying not
 
02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
to so we just have some concerns but we
 
02:47:01.510 --> 02:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
do think it is um a there's some good
 
02:47:04.110 --> 02:47:04.120 align:start position:0%
intent to this bill and it's a step in
 
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
the right direction but we do think it
 
02:47:08.230 --> 02:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
needs some work and uh some of those
 
02:47:10.110 --> 02:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
have points have been mentioned earlier
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
so I'd be open to any questions any
 
02:47:15.510 --> 02:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you
 
02:47:17.950 --> 02:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
thanks our
 
02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
Callaway thank you for your time really
 
02:47:33.830 --> 02:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
quick um I am a veteran I served
 
02:47:36.790 --> 02:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
overseas uh a long time ago um but I was
 
02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
also a federal employee overseas for a
 
02:47:42.750 --> 02:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
couple decades and uh I totally support
 
02:47:44.590 --> 02:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
what you're doing for the military but
 
02:47:45.990 --> 02:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
you have have to realize there are
 
02:47:47.990 --> 02:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
federal employees and a lot of other
 
02:47:50.389 --> 02:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
people who are overseas who are in just
 
02:47:52.190 --> 02:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
as much danger and just as bad
 
02:47:54.830 --> 02:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
conditions who deserve the same
 
02:47:56.550 --> 02:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
consideration um I'll give you an
 
02:47:58.230 --> 02:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
example I was overseas during the
 
02:48:00.710 --> 02:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
anthrax and all of the mail was shut
 
02:48:03.110 --> 02:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
down to all of the embassies the apos
 
02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
and everything the only way to get
 
02:48:06.469 --> 02:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
mailed back was to know somebody who
 
02:48:08.429 --> 02:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
happened to be coming back to the States
 
02:48:09.710 --> 02:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
so they could drop a letter in the
 
02:48:12.750 --> 02:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
mailbox for you so um I just want to
 
02:48:15.230 --> 02:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that you're aware of that with
 
02:48:17.030 --> 02:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
what's going on overseas there are Fe
 
02:48:18.590 --> 02:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
several embassies under ordered
 
02:48:21.790 --> 02:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
departure um I served overseas and at
 
02:48:24.269 --> 02:48:24.279 align:start position:0%
least uh for at least six years of which
 
02:48:27.150 --> 02:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
it was ordered departure uh very little
 
02:48:29.510 --> 02:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
access to mail so it is not as easy as
 
02:48:31.990 --> 02:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
people saying I was not in a submarine
 
02:48:34.110 --> 02:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
but I felt like I was in a submarine so
 
02:48:36.110 --> 02:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh please just make sure you
 
02:48:37.590 --> 02:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
take care of other people who are
 
02:48:39.429 --> 02:48:39.439 align:start position:0%
serving our country and other ways other
 
02:48:41.550 --> 02:48:41.560 align:start position:0%

02:48:56.349 --> 02:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
considered uocava voters they should be
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
some of them are federal only vot voters
 
02:49:02.389 --> 02:49:02.399 align:start position:0%

02:49:07.750 --> 02:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
vote on um uh the embassy is a good
 
02:49:09.349 --> 02:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
place for people to go through and get
 
02:49:12.349 --> 02:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
it when I was at an embassy um I had
 
02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
access to the state department email and
 
02:49:16.950 --> 02:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
there are other government systems that
 
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
can you know at least filter some of
 
02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
these I understand the concern about
 
02:49:22.910 --> 02:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
everybody but if you're looking at this
 
02:49:25.309 --> 02:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
and you're looking at military there are
 
02:49:27.630 --> 02:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
ways that the US government can help
 
02:49:29.790 --> 02:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
facilitate um the people who's serving
 
02:49:32.110 --> 02:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
overseas to do it more securely perhaps
 
02:49:34.030 --> 02:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
than just you know sending it over a
 
02:49:36.630 --> 02:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
regular email followup followup please
 
02:49:39.389 --> 02:49:39.399 align:start position:0%
um when someone is serving over seas
 
02:49:42.630 --> 02:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
whether it is in the military or in you
 
02:49:44.790 --> 02:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
know another role stationed at an
 
02:49:48.510 --> 02:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
Embassy whatever it may be DEA FBI doj
 
02:49:51.030 --> 02:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
all of those people are over there do
 
02:49:55.030 --> 02:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
those folks also maintain the right to
 
02:49:57.950 --> 02:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
vote no as American citizens no matter
 
02:49:59.229 --> 02:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
where they are stationed yes I was
 
02:50:02.750 --> 02:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
overseas for 16 years and um I got to
 
02:50:04.190 --> 02:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
vote as a New Hampshire resident the
 
02:50:06.910 --> 02:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
whole time um my my ballot didn't get to
 
02:50:09.309 --> 02:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
me once uh I don't know what happened to
 
02:50:11.030 --> 02:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
it it showed up two years later when I
 
02:50:13.389 --> 02:50:13.399 align:start position:0%
was in my next country over how it found
 
02:50:15.150 --> 02:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
me I have no idea
 
02:50:17.830 --> 02:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
but yes we do we do have the the right
 
02:50:20.990 --> 02:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
to do it if you are typically you can
 
02:50:23.110 --> 02:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
get your mail sent to the Embassy and
 
02:50:25.070 --> 02:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
you can pick it up there if it's not to
 
02:50:28.030 --> 02:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
a regular address thank yes I retain my
 
02:50:30.349 --> 02:50:30.359 align:start position:0%

02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%

apologize alrighty thank you so much for
 
02:52:05.870 --> 02:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
having me today uh representative Heath
 
02:52:07.150 --> 02:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
Howard representing the towns of
 
02:52:08.269 --> 02:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
straford and
 
02:52:12.070 --> 02:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
barington uh so hb1 1239 had a drafting
 
02:52:16.269 --> 02:52:16.279 align:start position:0%
error uh that is fixed by the amendment
 
02:52:16.279 --> 02:52:18.429 align:start position:0%
error uh that is fixed by the amendment
uh

02:52:18.429 --> 02:52:18.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
0304 uh I'll give you all a minute to
 
02:52:24.950 --> 02:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
read that uh but essentially the bill is
 
02:52:27.229 --> 02:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
intended to require candidates to submit
 
02:52:29.910 --> 02:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
Financial reports or test to not
 
02:52:31.870 --> 02:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
spending more than $1,000 in
 
02:52:35.070 --> 02:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
expenditures in a given reporting period
 
02:52:37.110 --> 02:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh this is important because in the 2022
 
02:52:40.389 --> 02:52:40.399 align:start position:0%
election 48 out of
 
02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
893 state representative candidates did
 
02:52:45.750 --> 02:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
not file and and we did not know if they
 
02:52:48.750 --> 02:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
didn't reach the $1,000 threshold or if
 
02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
they just didn't file at all whether
 
02:52:52.870 --> 02:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
they didn't know or refused
 
02:52:55.389 --> 02:52:55.399 align:start position:0%
to uh this would give the Attorney
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
General a more refined list of
 
02:52:59.269 --> 02:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
candidates to examine for potential
 
02:53:01.389 --> 02:53:01.399 align:start position:0%
violation and provides a legal
 
02:53:02.950 --> 02:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement of the candidate's
 
02:53:05.229 --> 02:53:05.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility to report financial
 
02:53:07.910 --> 02:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
information to the state uh that pretty
 
02:53:09.710 --> 02:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
much kind of covers everything and the
 
02:53:11.750 --> 02:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill uh and I'm open to
 
02:53:13.110 --> 02:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
any questions all right questions from
 
02:53:16.229 --> 02:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:53:17.630 --> 02:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
oh yeah see there's no way you get away
 
02:53:20.190 --> 02:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
with that all right representative
 
02:53:20.200 --> 02:53:21.750 align:start position:0%
with that all right representative
Lane

02:53:21.750 --> 02:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
Lane
 
02:53:24.790 --> 02:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
um I guess are you aware that we looked
 
02:53:27.990 --> 02:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
at a lot of this over the summer in the
 
02:53:32.670 --> 02:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
Omnibus campaign Finance yes so um so
 
02:53:35.790 --> 02:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
the question so can I may I follow up
 
02:53:37.429 --> 02:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
yes but let's avoid the word Omnibus
 
02:53:39.030 --> 02:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
because I just wrote a uh I just wrote a
 
02:53:41.070 --> 02:53:41.080 align:start position:0%
committee report that said we can
 
02:53:43.510 --> 02:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
decrying an omnus bill so decrying it
 
02:53:46.990 --> 02:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
was a uh comprehensive there we go how's
 
02:53:49.990 --> 02:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
that anyway would and I think this might
 
02:53:53.790 --> 02:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
have come up so would would you be
 
02:53:55.990 --> 02:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
willing to work with us on the because
 
02:53:59.150 --> 02:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
it might be nicer to fold that in or did
 
02:54:01.469 --> 02:54:01.479 align:start position:0%
you want it to stand alone this was
 
02:54:03.910 --> 02:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
actually more of a safety net uh to kind
 
02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
of provide us a route forward if uh the
 
02:54:08.910 --> 02:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
uh subcommittee couldn't come to an
 
02:54:11.229 --> 02:54:11.239 align:start position:0%
agreement okay thank you further
 
02:54:15.030 --> 02:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative weary uh
 
02:54:17.670 --> 02:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
a question about inflation um it's
 
02:54:20.070 --> 02:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
pretty easy to spend, dollar for signs
 
02:54:22.990 --> 02:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
and door hangings would you be open to
 
02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
upping the amount from 1,000 to 2,000 or
 
02:54:28.910 --> 02:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
something like that um not not
 
02:54:31.389 --> 02:54:31.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily because I mean even still
 
02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's uh this is something that I think
 
02:54:36.269 --> 02:54:36.279 align:start position:0%
that we may want to discuss as a
 
02:54:38.229 --> 02:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
committee and my personal opinion is
 
02:54:39.950 --> 02:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
that it should stay at a
 
02:54:41.710 --> 02:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
thousand sounds like representative
 
02:54:43.030 --> 02:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
weary will be joining the working group
 
02:54:45.389 --> 02:54:45.399 align:start position:0%
on campaign Finance thank you for thank
 
02:54:46.510 --> 02:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
you for your service representative
 
02:54:48.229 --> 02:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
weary further questions from the
 
02:54:50.269 --> 02:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
committee okay seeing none thank you
 
02:54:51.630 --> 02:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
representative Howard only one person
 
02:54:59.030 --> 02:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:01.670 --> 02:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
zinc um Olivia zinc executive director
 
02:55:03.349 --> 02:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
for open democracy and I'm a voter in
 
02:55:06.590 --> 02:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
Franklin New Hampshire um we oppose the
 
02:55:09.550 --> 02:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
bill but support the amendment um so I
 
02:55:11.389 --> 02:55:11.399 align:start position:0%
know that's a very strange position to
 
02:55:13.389 --> 02:55:13.399 align:start position:0%
take but um I think it's just because of
 
02:55:14.990 --> 02:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
the drafting error
 
02:55:16.990 --> 02:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
um I want to just talk about
 
02:55:18.590 --> 02:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
transparency I think it's really
 
02:55:20.630 --> 02:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
important for voters to know who spent
 
02:55:23.110 --> 02:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
who's the transparency voters need to
 
02:55:26.389 --> 02:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
know who's spending money um when we
 
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
looked at the 2022 campaign Finance data
 
02:55:33.349 --> 02:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
nine out of the 65 candidates for state
 
02:55:35.349 --> 02:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
senate didn't file campaign Finance
 
02:55:38.070 --> 02:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
reports I don't know why did they not
 
02:55:40.630 --> 02:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
running for Senate spend $1,000 or did
 
02:55:43.550 --> 02:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
they just not file we don't know but if
 
02:55:46.309 --> 02:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
you require them to at least say I
 
02:55:48.190 --> 02:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
didn't meet the
 
02:55:50.590 --> 02:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
threshold um or I had no
 
02:55:53.750 --> 02:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
activity um then then you at least know
 
02:55:56.070 --> 02:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
that they're under that threshold uh
 
02:55:58.269 --> 02:55:58.279 align:start position:0%
versus the candidates that don't file
 
02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
but there's often times where candidates
 
02:56:02.750 --> 02:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
might file the June report but miss the
 
02:56:04.510 --> 02:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
next report and then file the next
 
02:56:07.229 --> 02:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
report and I was told well they probably
 
02:56:08.710 --> 02:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
just didn't meet the thresold that
 
02:56:10.670 --> 02:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
period but I think that they still need
 
02:56:12.990 --> 02:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
to sort of check no activity during that
 
02:56:15.830 --> 02:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
period um and I think that this just
 
02:56:19.790 --> 02:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
gives a a needed transparency in knowing
 
02:56:22.150 --> 02:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
um who's filing reports even candidates
 
02:56:24.790 --> 02:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
for executive Council last time didn't
 
02:56:27.469 --> 02:56:27.479 align:start position:0%
file reports and then I saw that they
 
02:56:30.269 --> 02:56:30.279 align:start position:0%
filed them like nine months after the
 
02:56:33.790 --> 02:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
election so um so they actually needed
 
02:56:36.229 --> 02:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
to file reports but they just chose not
 
02:56:39.630 --> 02:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
to file them till nine months after so I
 
02:56:42.349 --> 02:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
I do think that um this checkbox would
 
02:56:44.229 --> 02:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
be helpful in just providing that sort
 
02:56:46.110 --> 02:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
of real time
 
02:56:48.790 --> 02:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
transparency um but also help with
 
02:56:50.990 --> 02:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement so you know which candidates
 
02:56:54.670 --> 02:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
have uh aren't aren't complying with the
 
02:56:57.469 --> 02:56:57.479 align:start position:0%
law and filing reports happy to take any
 
02:56:59.150 --> 02:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
questions all right representative bone
 
02:57:01.710 --> 02:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
you're up thank you so does this mean
 
02:57:05.550 --> 02:57:05.560 align:start position:0%
out of the probably eight of my 11
 
02:57:09.190 --> 02:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
elections that I never had any money
 
02:57:11.910 --> 02:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
given to me I would still have to fill
 
02:57:14.429 --> 02:57:14.439 align:start position:0%
out a form or you could just go on the
 
02:57:16.349 --> 02:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
online system and check a box that says
 
02:57:20.190 --> 02:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
I didn't you know
 
02:57:23.590 --> 02:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
file further question representative
 
02:57:25.710 --> 02:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
Bay thank you Mr
 
02:57:30.269 --> 02:57:30.279 align:start position:0%
chairperson um can you clarify to me uh
 
02:57:33.349 --> 02:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
because as as you said uh there you can
 
02:57:35.790 --> 02:57:35.800 align:start position:0%
file and by just checking that there
 
02:57:37.670 --> 02:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
there were no activities for for that
 
02:57:42.750 --> 02:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
period how uh this um that how this will
 
02:57:45.190 --> 02:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
help that out
 
02:57:48.110 --> 02:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
the so I think no activity is different
 
02:57:49.510 --> 02:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
than I didn't meet the
 
02:57:51.469 --> 02:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
threshold so that's sort of two
 
02:57:54.309 --> 02:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
different things so um you might have
 
02:57:56.750 --> 02:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
gotten $1,000 Dollar in June spent it
 
02:58:00.389 --> 02:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
but then between June and August you
 
02:58:03.630 --> 02:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
might not have re met that threshold so
 
02:58:07.269 --> 02:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
that's a no activity versus uh I didn't
 
02:58:10.870 --> 02:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
exceed the ,000 from the start um so if
 
02:58:13.429 --> 02:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
you're somebody who didn't exceed the,
 
02:58:15.070 --> 02:58:15.080 align:start position:0%
you file a June report that says I
 
02:58:16.950 --> 02:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
didn't exceed you file the August report
 
02:58:18.349 --> 02:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
I didn't exceed and then all of a sudden
 
02:58:20.910 --> 02:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
in September you have more than that and
 
02:58:22.990 --> 02:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
you filed it's it's sort of once you
 
02:58:24.590 --> 02:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
filed you're supposed to continue to
 
02:58:27.790 --> 02:58:27.800 align:start position:0%
file that's my understanding of the
 
02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:30.110 align:start position:0%
file that's my understanding of the
law

02:58:30.110 --> 02:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:58:34.950 --> 02:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
follow so uh is does this bill just add
 
02:58:39.110 --> 02:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
another place to check correct thank you
 
02:58:40.070 --> 02:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay further questions from the
 
02:58:42.630 --> 02:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you and we
 
02:58:44.429 --> 02:58:44.439 align:start position:0%
will make lunch uh there's no one else
 
02:58:45.830 --> 02:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak in person that I'm
 
02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:47.560 align:start position:0%
aware of at Le on PR cards can somebody
 
02:58:51.110 --> 02:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
pass me the blue sheet uh online we had
 
02:58:53.349 --> 02:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
five in favor one opposed I did read the
 
02:58:55.750 --> 02:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
comment for one opposed I don't think
 
02:58:58.110 --> 02:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
they were referring to this bill um but
 
02:59:00.429 --> 02:59:00.439 align:start position:0%
you know they did file in against it but
 
02:59:03.630 --> 02:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
their comment is uh unrelated at least
 
02:59:05.190 --> 02:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's how I interpret it so but anyways
 
02:59:07.950 --> 02:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
five to one um and we get the blue sheet
 
02:59:09.950 --> 02:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
and then we get to go to lunch does
 
02:59:11.030 --> 02:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
anybody know what the specials are in
 
02:59:11.040 --> 02:59:12.830 align:start position:0%
anybody know what the specials are in
the

02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:14.349 align:start position:0%
the
cafeteria

02:59:14.349 --> 02:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
cafeteria
 
02:59:18.630 --> 02:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
oh it was uh I'm AOS repealing RSA
 
02:59:20.830 --> 02:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
6646 which is not what the bill does
 
02:59:22.269 --> 02:59:22.279 align:start position:0%
there's no one signed up on the blue
 
02:59:25.670 --> 02:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
sheet um so with that we'll close the a
 
02:59:27.790 --> 02:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
we'll close the public hearing on House
 
02:59:42.830 --> 02:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:42.840 --> 04:03:37.070 align:start position:0%
 
o'

04:03:37.070 --> 04:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:37.080 --> 04:03:59.870 align:start position:0%
 
for

04:03:59.870 --> 04:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:02.550 --> 04:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
okay one o'clock uh going to open up the
 
04:04:06.429 --> 04:04:06.439 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 1369
 
04:04:08.990 --> 04:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
relative to the verification of V roles
 
04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
every four years going to go ahead and
 
04:04:15.030 --> 04:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
recognize our own representative Wei um
 
04:04:19.630 --> 04:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:22.510 --> 04:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
bill all right thank you Mr chair and
 
04:04:24.149 --> 04:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
honorable committee
 
04:04:27.309 --> 04:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
members um for the record my name is
 
04:04:29.149 --> 04:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
Robert worry and I have the privilege of
 
04:04:32.229 --> 04:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
serving in Hillsboro's County's 13th
 
04:04:35.229 --> 04:04:35.239 align:start position:0%
District um which is the 10th largest
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
population Center in New Hampshire the
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
great town of Hudson
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
um just as a matter of the rationale for
 
04:04:48.950 --> 04:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
why introducing this bill um current law
 
04:04:53.269 --> 04:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
under 65438 and 65439 specifies a
 
04:04:55.469 --> 04:04:55.479 align:start position:0%
verification of checklist with the
 
04:04:57.550 --> 04:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
latter requiring mandatory verification
 
04:04:59.990 --> 04:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
every 10 years uh however there have
 
04:05:02.790 --> 04:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
been some problems with uh compliance on
 
04:05:06.349 --> 04:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
this matter in the TW uh after the
 
04:05:09.670 --> 04:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
20 uh no in the 2020 general election
 
04:05:11.590 --> 04:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
the voter roles were calculated to have
 
04:05:15.229 --> 04:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:15.239 --> 04:05:17.229 align:start position:0%
 
1,100

04:05:17.229 --> 04:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
1,100
 
04:05:19.110 --> 04:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
19,23 to
 
04:05:23.550 --> 04:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
voters in 2021 when the 10-year voter
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
list Purge was enacted under
 
04:05:32.269 --> 04:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
65439 they removed approximately 21% of
 
04:05:34.750 --> 04:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
the state's voter rooll list reducing
 
04:05:37.630 --> 04:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
the list from the original Total over a
 
04:05:54.600 --> 04:05:54.610 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:54.610 --> 04:06:07.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:06:07.830 --> 04:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
% should account for transfers in and
 
04:06:12.429 --> 04:06:12.439 align:start position:0%
out of New Hampshire and deaths as
 
04:06:13.750 --> 04:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
factors that would affect the voting
 
04:06:16.349 --> 04:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
roll counts it perhaps does not account
 
04:06:17.870 --> 04:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
for firsttime
 
04:06:21.229 --> 04:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
voters um and other residents voting for
 
04:06:24.189 --> 04:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
the first time however the the factor uh
 
04:06:26.910 --> 04:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't really uh create that gap
 
04:06:30.870 --> 04:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
between the 5.1% growth and the 21%
 
04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
reduction in the number of Voters on the
 
04:06:37.389 --> 04:06:37.399 align:start position:0%
voter rooll list for New Hampshire so I
 
04:06:43.030 --> 04:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
think uh there is a concern that this
 
04:06:47.469 --> 04:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
time period is too long um and that uh
 
04:06:49.469 --> 04:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
the 10year time period is currently
 
04:06:52.269 --> 04:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
codified in the RSA is too long and
 
04:06:55.469 --> 04:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
therefore it needs to be reduced to a
 
04:06:59.229 --> 04:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
much lower level I will also state that
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
um corollary to that um in after the
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
2020 election there was a voter
 
04:07:10.030 --> 04:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
Integrity group that went around and
 
04:07:13.349 --> 04:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
found uh through various forms of uh
 
04:07:16.389 --> 04:07:16.399 align:start position:0%
inquiry that there had been 15,000
 
04:07:20.110 --> 04:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
movers in the state and uh a thousand
 
04:07:23.149 --> 04:07:23.159 align:start position:0%
examples of Deeds transfers where both
 
04:07:26.070 --> 04:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
the seller and the buyer vote buyer
 
04:07:29.349 --> 04:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
voted in that same
 
04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
election um and an additional 800
 
04:07:36.870 --> 04:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
examples were provided later to uh the
 
04:07:40.149 --> 04:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and a total of
 
04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
again a total of 15,000 names were
 
04:07:45.910 --> 04:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
provided where uh clearly there
 
04:07:51.710 --> 04:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
was um illegitimate voting going on so
 
04:07:57.269 --> 04:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
um so I think if this process is at is
 
04:08:00.349 --> 04:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
at least um verified on a more frequent
 
04:08:05.070 --> 04:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
basis we have an opportunity to to
 
04:08:08.550 --> 04:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
avoid um the the types of uh figures
 
04:08:11.229 --> 04:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
that I gave before and have more
 
04:08:13.109 --> 04:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
accurate voter lists and greater
 
04:08:14.910 --> 04:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
Integrity in our
 
04:08:17.149 --> 04:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
elections I'll take I'm happy to take
 
04:08:18.670 --> 04:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
any questions if you have any questions
 
04:08:20.269 --> 04:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
Burnham thank you Mr chairman um thank
 
04:08:26.510 --> 04:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um do you
 
04:08:28.109 --> 04:08:28.119 align:start position:0%
know how long the supervisor of the
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
checklist term is uh generally I believe
 
04:08:34.670 --> 04:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
um I in my town I think I've seen three
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
years I I'm not entirely sure but I
 
04:08:40.790 --> 04:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
think that what I've seen in my town
 
04:08:44.189 --> 04:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
it but uh that's what I'm aware of
 
04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
followup uh let's go to representative
 
04:08:48.309 --> 04:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
bone and then we'll come
 
04:08:51.389 --> 04:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
back right now 10 years they send out a
 
04:08:53.710 --> 04:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
postcard saying are you're still alive
 
04:08:57.309 --> 04:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
or here I mean so this is I don't know
 
04:08:59.429 --> 04:08:59.439 align:start position:0%
how I couldn't read anything and how
 
04:09:01.630 --> 04:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
that going to be done but you say by
 
04:09:04.229 --> 04:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
newspaper a lot of towns don't have any
 
04:09:08.750 --> 04:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
circulation newspapers anymore um so
 
04:09:12.109 --> 04:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
it's kind of hard to say to advertise
 
04:09:14.750 --> 04:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
this if there's a you know especially
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
you people complain about the internet I
 
04:09:19.269 --> 04:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
don't have the internet you know so how
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
are we going to get the word out to the
 
04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
people that may still exist but don't
 
04:09:28.309 --> 04:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:30.950 --> 04:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
to newspapers or
 
04:09:33.109 --> 04:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
Internet well thank thank you for your
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
question representative B I believe that
 
04:09:37.950 --> 04:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
the process for removing someone from a
 
04:09:40.630 --> 04:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
checklist involves a certified letter at
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
least that's been the practice in in the
 
04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
town of Hudson so yeah um I believe that
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's how they would address it I don't
 
04:09:51.790 --> 04:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
you know with respect to notifications
 
04:09:54.389 --> 04:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
of Supervisors of the checklist meetings
 
04:09:56.510 --> 04:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
and things like that that might have
 
04:09:58.149 --> 04:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
previously appeared in newspapers I'm
 
04:10:03.149 --> 04:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
not really um I'm not sure that that's
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh necessarily directly gerine to this
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh proposed uh uh bill I think I think
 
04:10:11.830 --> 04:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
that is another issue that could be
 
04:10:14.109 --> 04:10:14.119 align:start position:0%
addressed but I think primarily we're
 
04:10:16.870 --> 04:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
trying to address the interval between
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
these mandatory verifications of the
 
04:10:24.269 --> 04:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
checklist okay further questions repres
 
04:10:28.590 --> 04:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
Burnham thank you um so I was just made
 
04:10:31.830 --> 04:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
aware in my town that the um supervised
 
04:10:35.309 --> 04:10:35.319 align:start position:0%
over the checklist term is six years so
 
04:10:38.550 --> 04:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
um currently the voter purges 10 years
 
04:10:40.349 --> 04:10:40.359 align:start position:0%
um do you see that there might be any
 
04:10:40.359 --> 04:10:41.710 align:start position:0%
um do you see that there might be any
kind

04:10:41.710 --> 04:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
kind
 
04:10:45.670 --> 04:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
of issue with um the long term of
 
04:10:50.550 --> 04:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
checklist supervisors and only a 10 o uh
 
04:10:55.590 --> 04:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:58.990 --> 04:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
years I do I don't think there are any I
 
04:11:01.469 --> 04:11:01.479 align:start position:0%
don't have any evidence of any
 
04:11:03.389 --> 04:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
correlations between the length of terms
 
04:11:06.269 --> 04:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
of the checklist of the supervisors and
 
04:11:09.149 --> 04:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
the the what I would say is a parent
 
04:11:11.469 --> 04:11:11.479 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with the 10-year voter
 
04:11:15.189 --> 04:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
list Purge so I'm not sure I can I can
 
04:11:17.830 --> 04:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
comment on that I think you know there
 
04:11:21.510 --> 04:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
are advantages to having someone for an
 
04:11:23.950 --> 04:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
extended period of time in that position
 
04:11:25.510 --> 04:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
because they are familiar with the
 
04:11:28.030 --> 04:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
community and perhaps someone coming in
 
04:11:29.670 --> 04:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
might not be as familiar with the
 
04:11:32.670 --> 04:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
community but um beyond that I I really
 
04:11:34.870 --> 04:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
don't have any uh characteristics to
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
provide any attributes to the
 
04:11:38.670 --> 04:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
correlation or causation between the
 
04:11:40.590 --> 04:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
two further
 
04:11:43.750 --> 04:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative wood yes thank
 
04:11:45.990 --> 04:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
04:11:49.269 --> 04:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
um this morning we heard there's two
 
04:11:51.510 --> 04:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
ways to change the
 
04:11:54.670 --> 04:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
checklist uh one was uh if you move and
 
04:11:57.790 --> 04:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
register in another uh jurisdiction and
 
04:12:00.469 --> 04:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
the other one was uh a death certificate
 
04:12:03.030 --> 04:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any others I think you
 
04:12:07.070 --> 04:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
can you can um approach the supervisors
 
04:12:09.590 --> 04:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
of the checklist about issues and and
 
04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
ask them about that and they can
 
04:12:15.670 --> 04:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
investigate that I don't have that uh
 
04:12:19.229 --> 04:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
particular passage memorized but um I
 
04:12:22.950 --> 04:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
think that's a possibility followup yep
 
04:12:27.389 --> 04:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
followup um looking at your numbers here
 
04:12:30.590 --> 04:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
21% um it seems like a a large number in
 
04:12:33.510 --> 04:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
10 years if we have these two mechanisms
 
04:12:35.309 --> 04:12:35.319 align:start position:0%
going on so people moving within the
 
04:12:37.870 --> 04:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
state we should be seeing that if the if
 
04:12:39.990 --> 04:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
they continued voters and if they're
 
04:12:43.109 --> 04:12:43.119 align:start position:0%
dying we should be seeing that so 21%
 
04:12:44.990 --> 04:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
even if you count all the movs moving
 
04:12:47.189 --> 04:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
out of state doesn't seem like we should
 
04:12:50.030 --> 04:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
come up with that many votes do you have
 
04:12:53.510 --> 04:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
any clue of why this number is so high
 
04:12:56.429 --> 04:12:56.439 align:start position:0%
no as as I said there's I looked at the
 
04:13:00.590 --> 04:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
I tried to think of what um from a kind
 
04:13:03.550 --> 04:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
of statistical point of view how how to
 
04:13:05.710 --> 04:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
approach determining the validity of
 
04:13:07.710 --> 04:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
that 21% reduction
 
04:13:10.469 --> 04:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
in the voter Ro checklist I I thought of
 
04:13:12.429 --> 04:13:12.439 align:start position:0%
looking at the population numbers over
 
04:13:15.469 --> 04:13:15.479 align:start position:0%
that same time period that only has I
 
04:13:19.030 --> 04:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
testified that only had a 5.1% increase
 
04:13:20.590 --> 04:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
you know so it's moving the opposite
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
direction of the uh percentages of the
 
04:13:26.429 --> 04:13:26.439 align:start position:0%
voter Ro checklist so that uh you know
 
04:13:30.990 --> 04:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
that is a um you know fairly large
 
04:13:34.550 --> 04:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
discrepancy um so I I don't know and and
 
04:13:34.560 --> 04:13:36.149 align:start position:0%
discrepancy um so I I don't know and and
it

04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:13:36.159 --> 04:13:37.950 align:start position:0%
it
certainly

04:13:37.950 --> 04:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:13:43.309 --> 04:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
is very suspect um so I think and as I
 
04:13:45.349 --> 04:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned the the information that was
 
04:13:47.030 --> 04:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
brought to the attorney general which
 
04:13:50.349 --> 04:13:50.359 align:start position:0%
they have have said is a report is
 
04:13:53.590 --> 04:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
forthcoming but but it's hard um you
 
04:13:57.149 --> 04:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
know that that is an investigation
 
04:13:59.550 --> 04:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
launched in
 
04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
2021 detecting over 15,000 voters who
 
04:14:07.630 --> 04:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
were not properly doic
 
04:14:10.149 --> 04:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
iled and at least according to the
 
04:14:12.710 --> 04:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
affidavit submitted to the Attorney
 
04:14:16.990 --> 04:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
General's office and and so it's now
 
04:14:19.950 --> 04:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
taken if if you understand that those
 
04:14:21.630 --> 04:14:21.640 align:start position:0%
were presented in
 
04:14:25.590 --> 04:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
2021 you know we're now in uh 2024 it's
 
04:14:28.670 --> 04:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
taken an extended period of time to
 
04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
properly investigate that I'm not I'm
 
04:14:30.720 --> 04:14:31.870 align:start position:0%
properly investigate that I'm not I'm
not

04:14:31.870 --> 04:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:14:35.309 --> 04:14:35.319 align:start position:0%
um uh putting any aspersions on the
 
04:14:36.750 --> 04:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office you know
 
04:14:39.070 --> 04:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
invest investigations take a lot of time
 
04:14:41.429 --> 04:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
and so I think they're they've been
 
04:14:43.309 --> 04:14:43.319 align:start position:0%
looking at I'm hoping that this report
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
will will you know at least to some
 
04:14:50.950 --> 04:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
degree address um the concern about
 
04:14:53.149 --> 04:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
having these people voting when they
 
04:14:53.159 --> 04:14:54.710 align:start position:0%
having these people voting when they
shouldn't

04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
be further
 
04:15:01.469 --> 04:15:01.479 align:start position:0%
questions rter thank you Mr chair um
 
04:15:03.309 --> 04:15:03.319 align:start position:0%
would you expect that this would cause
 
04:15:06.070 --> 04:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
increased costs for towns and cities for
 
04:15:11.429 --> 04:15:11.439 align:start position:0%
mailing advert iing anything else no I
 
04:15:14.269 --> 04:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
um not unless there was a mass Exodus of
 
04:15:17.389 --> 04:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
the Town um but um I think
 
04:15:22.389 --> 04:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
generally um I don't think it would I in
 
04:15:22.399 --> 04:15:23.710 align:start position:0%
generally um I don't think it would I in
looking

04:15:23.710 --> 04:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
looking
 
04:15:26.469 --> 04:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
at um the factor well you know the the
 
04:15:27.990 --> 04:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
very fact that they would have to do
 
04:15:30.510 --> 04:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
this more frequently I believe it would
 
04:15:33.070 --> 04:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of actions that they
 
04:15:34.750 --> 04:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
would have to take and therefore I think
 
04:15:37.830 --> 04:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
there's a commensurate tradeoff between
 
04:15:40.229 --> 04:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
you know doing a larger list every 10
 
04:15:40.239 --> 04:15:41.269 align:start position:0%
you know doing a larger list every 10
years

04:15:41.269 --> 04:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:15:44.269 --> 04:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
versus ostensibly a smaller list of
 
04:15:47.429 --> 04:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
removals on a four-year cycle good
 
04:15:49.349 --> 04:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
04:15:53.149 --> 04:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
Lane you um how did you arrive at the
 
04:15:53.159 --> 04:15:54.710 align:start position:0%
Lane you um how did you arrive at the
four-year

04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
four-year
 
04:15:54.720 --> 04:15:59.429 align:start position:0%
four-year
figure

04:15:59.429 --> 04:15:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:02.349 --> 04:16:02.359 align:start position:0%
um that's a great question I I had
 
04:16:05.830 --> 04:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
discussed it with different people and
 
04:16:07.469 --> 04:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
um it seemed like
 
04:16:07.479 --> 04:16:09.269 align:start position:0%
um it seemed like
like

04:16:09.269 --> 04:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:16:12.550 --> 04:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
um you I also wanted to be sensitive to
 
04:16:14.349 --> 04:16:14.359 align:start position:0%
the position of the checklist of the
 
04:16:19.550 --> 04:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
supervisors and I think they have um you
 
04:16:21.229 --> 04:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
know regular meetings throughout the
 
04:16:23.910 --> 04:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
year and
 
04:16:23.920 --> 04:16:26.309 align:start position:0%
year and
therefore

04:16:26.309 --> 04:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
04:16:29.309 --> 04:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
um especially during an election year
 
04:16:29.319 --> 04:16:31.710 align:start position:0%
um especially during an election year
and

04:16:31.710 --> 04:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:34.750 --> 04:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
so I tried to I I didn't think it was
 
04:16:36.630 --> 04:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
good to do it every necessarily two
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
years years um I did talk to some people
 
04:16:40.910 --> 04:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
who would have done it every year for
 
04:16:43.590 --> 04:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
that matter um I talked to some people
 
04:16:46.269 --> 04:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
who wanted to do it every five years uh
 
04:16:49.109 --> 04:16:49.119 align:start position:0%
kind of an off cycle with the census um
 
04:16:52.389 --> 04:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
and then on on the census I picked every
 
04:16:54.870 --> 04:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
four years just as being sort of a
 
04:16:57.229 --> 04:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
compromise between what I thought were
 
04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
various extremes and um I don't have any
 
04:17:03.429 --> 04:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
evidence or or data to support that
 
04:17:06.269 --> 04:17:06.279 align:start position:0%
selection other than maybe anecdotal
 
04:17:08.990 --> 04:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
discussions with other
 
04:17:10.990 --> 04:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
Representatives further questions from
 
04:17:14.550 --> 04:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
the committee um I have one um so we
 
04:17:16.510 --> 04:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
currently do this voter roll Purge every
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
10 years right and every 10 years we
 
04:17:20.950 --> 04:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
look back four years yes so what is the
 
04:17:22.910 --> 04:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
harm if we're looking back the same
 
04:17:25.870 --> 04:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
period of time what is the harm of doing
 
04:17:28.830 --> 04:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
it more frequently like under so
 
04:17:30.389 --> 04:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
underneath current law my understanding
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
is someone could go without voting in
 
04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire for nine
 
04:17:35.550 --> 04:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
years and be stuck on the roles until
 
04:17:37.469 --> 04:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
they get to an even year to a year that
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
ends in zero and then they would come
 
04:17:39.910 --> 04:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
off is that the that's the current law
 
04:17:43.910 --> 04:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
right well in in the in the 01 year yeah
 
04:17:46.630 --> 04:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
the 01 year yeah that's when it it now
 
04:17:49.309 --> 04:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
is done on so the next one would would
 
04:17:53.670 --> 04:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
be uh 2031 ostensibly okay so I'm trying
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
to accelerate that a little bit fair
 
04:17:57.469 --> 04:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
enough further comment questions from
 
04:17:58.830 --> 04:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank you
 
04:18:01.389 --> 04:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
representative weary thank you next up
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:05.720 --> 04:18:09.870 align:start position:0%
 
scanland

04:18:09.870 --> 04:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:11.309 --> 04:18:11.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:18:13.070 --> 04:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David scanland Secretary
 
04:18:16.070 --> 04:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
of State and I'm here in support of this
 
04:18:20.070 --> 04:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
bill um I I will say that the the 10year
 
04:18:23.109 --> 04:18:23.119 align:start position:0%
cycle that we're on now to verify the
 
04:18:25.349 --> 04:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
checklist has been in existence for
 
04:18:27.710 --> 04:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
quite some time and it certainly
 
04:18:30.550 --> 04:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
predated the centralized Statewide voter
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
data base that we were required to put
 
04:18:35.070 --> 04:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
in place when the help America vote Act
 
04:18:39.750 --> 04:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
passed in 20 2 and prior to that time
 
04:18:43.070 --> 04:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
many towns uh in the state kept their
 
04:18:45.550 --> 04:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
checklists on their own spreadsheet
 
04:18:47.550 --> 04:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
programs there were some of the smaller
 
04:18:51.630 --> 04:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
towns that actually hand had handwritten
 
04:18:54.070 --> 04:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
checklists and so you can understand the
 
04:18:56.309 --> 04:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
reason for a 10-year cycle is it was a
 
04:18:59.070 --> 04:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
big job to clean up the
 
04:19:03.349 --> 04:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
list so now we are uh you know we have a
 
04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter registration database we
 
04:19:06.479 --> 04:19:07.309 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter registration database we
are

04:19:07.309 --> 04:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:19:10.830 --> 04:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
replacing the Legacy system and hope to
 
04:19:14.389 --> 04:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
go live in April or May with a brand new
 
04:19:16.469 --> 04:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
database which will have a lot more
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
functionality it will have the national
 
04:19:21.510 --> 04:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
change of address
 
04:19:24.990 --> 04:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
information uh plugged into that on a uh
 
04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
multiple times a year cycle uh it'll be
 
04:19:30.790 --> 04:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
easier for us to transmit uh death data
 
04:19:33.229 --> 04:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
from our division of Vital Records so
 
04:19:35.389 --> 04:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
that the towns have better access to
 
04:19:37.670 --> 04:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
that information
 
04:19:41.389 --> 04:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
I would recommend a time frame of six
 
04:19:44.149 --> 04:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
years and the reason that I do that is
 
04:19:47.309 --> 04:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
that every there are many many many
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
voters in this state that only vote in a
 
04:19:53.670 --> 04:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
general election when we're electing a
 
04:19:57.189 --> 04:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
president and so if we purge the
 
04:20:00.070 --> 04:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
checklist more frequently than that
 
04:20:02.109 --> 04:20:02.119 align:start position:0%
those voters are all going to drop off
 
04:20:02.119 --> 04:20:02.910 align:start position:0%
those voters are all going to drop off
the

04:20:02.910 --> 04:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:05.149 --> 04:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
checklist uh before they come to vote
 
04:20:07.109 --> 04:20:07.119 align:start position:0%
the next time and they'll end up having
 
04:20:12.149 --> 04:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
to re-register again so um you know I
 
04:20:15.469 --> 04:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
think the the cycle that we work on now
 
04:20:18.269 --> 04:20:18.279 align:start position:0%
is two election Cycles or four years for
 
04:20:20.269 --> 04:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
that very reason and I think it would
 
04:20:24.349 --> 04:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
made make sense uh to maintain
 
04:20:24.359 --> 04:20:26.149 align:start position:0%
made make sense uh to maintain
that

04:20:26.149 --> 04:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:29.910 --> 04:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
the the database changes every single
 
04:20:32.229 --> 04:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
day so if you print a checklist off
 
04:20:34.389 --> 04:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
today it's going to be different
 
04:20:38.710 --> 04:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and uh over over time uh the
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
changes are pretty dramatic so uh
 
04:20:44.070 --> 04:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
whenever we did the 10-year Purge uh
 
04:20:46.990 --> 04:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
just this most recent uh time I think
 
04:20:50.389 --> 04:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
that there were probably 170,000 names
 
04:20:53.469 --> 04:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
give or take that uh were dropped from
 
04:20:56.349 --> 04:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
the list and many of those voters
 
04:20:58.109 --> 04:20:58.119 align:start position:0%
re-registered for the presidential
 
04:21:00.309 --> 04:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
primary and I would expect that this
 
04:21:04.590 --> 04:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
fall there will be another uh uh spike
 
04:21:07.309 --> 04:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
in registrations because of that but you
 
04:21:10.109 --> 04:21:10.119 align:start position:0%
know that's what it takes to keep the uh
 
04:21:12.229 --> 04:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
the checklist up to date I think if we
 
04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
went to a six-year term those you know
 
04:21:18.030 --> 04:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
those dramatic Peaks and valleys will
 
04:21:19.590 --> 04:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
level out a little bit and I think that
 
04:21:21.870 --> 04:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
would be a positive thing as well so I'd
 
04:21:24.109 --> 04:21:24.119 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions just to
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
clarify your your suggestion so you're
 
04:21:28.830 --> 04:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
talking about every four years we would
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
look back every six years or every six
 
04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
years we look back every four years
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:37.710 --> 04:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
four oh sorry other questions think me
 
04:21:41.389 --> 04:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:41.399 --> 04:21:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
down

04:21:43.990 --> 04:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
down
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'll keep going um
 
04:21:51.109 --> 04:21:51.119 align:start position:0%
so why wouldn't we do something like
 
04:21:54.630 --> 04:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
every four years we look back five
 
04:21:56.510 --> 04:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
years because that would accomplish the
 
04:21:58.670 --> 04:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
same goal right five years encompasses
 
04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
to two no matter what five years
 
04:22:01.990 --> 04:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
Encompass is a presidential election no
 
04:22:04.309 --> 04:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
matter what
 
04:22:07.990 --> 04:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
um why would we go to a frequency of six
 
04:22:10.229 --> 04:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
years like I would rather extend the
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
look back I would rather extend the look
 
04:22:15.750 --> 04:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
back period than decrease the frequency
 
04:22:18.590 --> 04:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
why would you want to
 
04:22:20.389 --> 04:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
overlap well if it was up to me I would
 
04:22:21.870 --> 04:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
do it every year so let's start off with
 
04:22:23.469 --> 04:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
that I would do it every year and look
 
04:22:24.550 --> 04:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
back if if I was writing this
 
04:22:25.870 --> 04:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
legislation I would do it to where it
 
04:22:27.269 --> 04:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
looked back every year and I would have
 
04:22:28.790 --> 04:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
it look back I would do it every year
 
04:22:30.990 --> 04:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
looking back five years um just to
 
04:22:32.149 --> 04:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
because then you would never have a
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
fallof um which would actually be an
 
04:22:35.990 --> 04:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
extension of what we do now it would be
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
longer than than what we look back now
 
04:22:38.990 --> 04:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I was just kind of curious as the
 
04:22:42.109 --> 04:22:42.119 align:start position:0%
logic of that um like how how like why
 
04:22:44.149 --> 04:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
not why s why every six years looking
 
04:22:45.510 --> 04:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
back four instead of every four years
 
04:22:49.870 --> 04:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:54.189 --> 04:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
five there's a uh a a tradeoff between
 
04:22:56.389 --> 04:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
you know trying to address
 
04:22:58.590 --> 04:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
the uh you know the number of Voters
 
04:23:00.070 --> 04:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
that have dropped off the list or should
 
04:23:02.469 --> 04:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
drop off the list versus the workload
 
04:23:05.109 --> 04:23:05.119 align:start position:0%
that we place on the local supervisors
 
04:23:07.030 --> 04:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the checklist and I that's probably
 
04:23:09.429 --> 04:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
the most important factor yeah but you
 
04:23:12.109 --> 04:23:12.119 align:start position:0%
know I'm suggesting six years as a you
 
04:23:14.510 --> 04:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
know as a good interval but you know
 
04:23:16.510 --> 04:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
that's an arbitrary number
 
04:23:20.269 --> 04:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
yeah uh represent brenon thank you can
 
04:23:23.590 --> 04:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
you explain the process um and how much
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
time it takes to for election officials
 
04:23:29.790 --> 04:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
to conduct this purge so it can just get
 
04:23:32.990 --> 04:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
an understanding of the workload uh the
 
04:23:34.149 --> 04:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
time that it
 
04:23:36.870 --> 04:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
takes can you help me out with that
 
04:23:38.710 --> 04:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
well it takes the supervisors of a
 
04:23:41.229 --> 04:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
checklist several months uh to do this
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
job where they they do a review of their
 
04:23:47.149 --> 04:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
checklist and then those names that they
 
04:23:50.830 --> 04:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
cannot confirm as voters uh because of
 
04:23:52.950 --> 04:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
their because they are
 
04:23:57.109 --> 04:23:57.119 align:start position:0%
inactive um then get tagged for being
 
04:24:00.830 --> 04:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
dropped and there is a notice that gets
 
04:24:02.870 --> 04:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
sent out that that is what is
 
04:24:06.389 --> 04:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
occurring uh it's not a 30-day letter
 
04:24:09.269 --> 04:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
it's it is you know you've been inactive
 
04:24:11.830 --> 04:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
your name is being dropped from the list
 
04:24:13.870 --> 04:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
and if you want to participate in future
 
04:24:16.269 --> 04:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
elections you have to
 
04:24:16.279 --> 04:24:18.670 align:start position:0%
elections you have to
re-register

04:24:18.670 --> 04:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
re-register
 
04:24:22.670 --> 04:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah and it does take several months
 
04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
the mailings are prepared at the local
 
04:24:27.309 --> 04:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
level they're paid for at the local
 
04:24:29.870 --> 04:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
level but the data itself is kept and
 
04:24:32.189 --> 04:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
maintained at the state level followup
 
04:24:33.870 --> 04:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
please uh we had one other hand first
 
04:24:36.349 --> 04:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
and we'll come back I guess they they
 
04:24:37.469 --> 04:24:37.479 align:start position:0%
they're waving all you can go yes
 
04:24:42.229 --> 04:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative Bren thank you um so if
 
04:24:46.229 --> 04:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
the purge as we are calling it occurs
 
04:24:49.750 --> 04:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
more frequently it sounds like there
 
04:24:53.830 --> 04:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
would be a tax impact or that taxpayers
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
would be paying supervisors of the
 
04:24:59.030 --> 04:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
checklist more money to conduct this
 
04:25:01.389 --> 04:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
work is that am I understanding that
 
04:25:03.830 --> 04:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
correctly that this since the
 
04:25:07.349 --> 04:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities do pay for this
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
um this purge process which takes
 
04:25:09.840 --> 04:25:11.389 align:start position:0%
um this purge process which takes
several

04:25:11.389 --> 04:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
several
 
04:25:14.189 --> 04:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
months would we see an increase in cost
 
04:25:16.349 --> 04:25:16.359 align:start position:0%
for taxpayers there may be a slight
 
04:25:18.269 --> 04:25:18.279 align:start position:0%
increase in costs I think the benefit of
 
04:25:20.429 --> 04:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
doing it more frequently is that that
 
04:25:23.070 --> 04:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
you would reduce the number of
 
04:25:25.269 --> 04:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
individuals that would be
 
04:25:27.030 --> 04:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
impacted thank
 
04:25:29.790 --> 04:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
you questions um you said in your
 
04:25:31.469 --> 04:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
testimony it takes a long time but this
 
04:25:33.189 --> 04:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
is just a data sort of people who
 
04:25:34.910 --> 04:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
haven't voted in the last four years how
 
04:25:37.349 --> 04:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
does that take time it's all done in the
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
database it is done in the database but
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
there is there is review there's
 
04:25:43.710 --> 04:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
cleansing there's preparing the mailing
 
04:25:46.510 --> 04:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a process okay so the data
 
04:25:48.189 --> 04:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
side of it is like seconds I would
 
04:25:50.790 --> 04:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
assume I would expect the data side as
 
04:25:52.469 --> 04:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
long as it's clean would be very quick
 
04:25:54.630 --> 04:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
would be seconds okay and then as for
 
04:25:57.109 --> 04:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
the cost wouldn't the cost be the same
 
04:25:58.590 --> 04:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about the same
 
04:25:59.910 --> 04:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
number of Voters getting removed but
 
04:26:01.510 --> 04:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
instead of once every 10 years it's on a
 
04:26:03.510 --> 04:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
more frequently basis so wouldn't that
 
04:26:05.109 --> 04:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
workload decrease because it wouldn't
 
04:26:06.510 --> 04:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
just be this massive thing you're doing
 
04:26:08.309 --> 04:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
every 10 years but it' be the same
 
04:26:09.830 --> 04:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
number of Voters so if the cost of the
 
04:26:11.910 --> 04:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
mail the postage doesn't change in the
 
04:26:14.469 --> 04:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
inflation but so wouldn't the cost be
 
04:26:16.990 --> 04:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
basically the same except it's less
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
frequent except when it happens it's not
 
04:26:20.349 --> 04:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
this big large project it's just this
 
04:26:23.109 --> 04:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
thing you do more frequently I I would
 
04:26:25.269 --> 04:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
think that doing it more frequent more
 
04:26:27.990 --> 04:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
frequently like this bill suggests would
 
04:26:30.670 --> 04:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
lower the cost for each time that it was
 
04:26:32.349 --> 04:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
done I haven't done enough of an
 
04:26:35.389 --> 04:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
analysis to say that it would just be a
 
04:26:37.389 --> 04:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
level cost fair enough thank you any
 
04:26:39.630 --> 04:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Ward
 
04:26:42.189 --> 04:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr scanland
 
04:26:45.389 --> 04:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
um secretary could you explain a little
 
04:26:47.429 --> 04:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
bit of how the national change of
 
04:26:49.830 --> 04:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
address match system whatever it's
 
04:26:51.630 --> 04:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
called precisely
 
04:26:55.510 --> 04:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
might uh work on this bill so there are
 
04:26:56.910 --> 04:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there are
 
04:26:59.189 --> 04:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
third-party vendors that have been
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
approved by the United States Postal
 
04:27:04.229 --> 04:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
Service that will collect all the
 
04:27:06.389 --> 04:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
information from the postal records
 
04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
about individuals that have moved and
 
04:27:11.149 --> 04:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
filed with a post office that they have
 
04:27:14.030 --> 04:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
permanently changed their address and
 
04:27:17.429 --> 04:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
that that information is available uh at
 
04:27:19.590 --> 04:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
certain intervals over the course of a
 
04:27:23.790 --> 04:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
year and uh there's a subscription cost
 
04:27:26.870 --> 04:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
to obtaining that information but uh
 
04:27:29.710 --> 04:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
once that Arrangement has been made that
 
04:27:33.830 --> 04:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
information is uh put into the
 
04:27:36.229 --> 04:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
transferred into the database so so that
 
04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
that information is available then for
 
04:27:41.149 --> 04:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist to go
 
04:27:42.910 --> 04:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
through and clean up their
 
04:27:45.550 --> 04:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
records follow up one follow up yep so
 
04:27:47.389 --> 04:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
do we not subscribe to this already I
 
04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
thought they re at least one one I
 
04:27:52.550 --> 04:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
believe we do with the new database
 
04:27:53.510 --> 04:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
though I think we're going to have a
 
04:27:56.630 --> 04:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
better format for transferring that data
 
04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you all right further
 
04:28:01.149 --> 04:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
questions see none all right thank you
 
04:28:01.159 --> 04:28:02.590 align:start position:0%
questions see none all right thank you
secretary

04:28:02.590 --> 04:28:02.600 align:start position:0%

that thank you no worries um all
 
04:28:17.830 --> 04:28:17.840 align:start position:0%

04:28:34.510 --> 04:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
Germain good afternoon members of the
 
04:28:35.990 --> 04:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee um good to see you all all
 
04:28:38.309 --> 04:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
again my name is Mackenzie St Germain
 
04:28:39.950 --> 04:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
I'm the campaign director for the New
 
04:28:42.070 --> 04:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire campaign for voting rights um
 
04:28:44.349 --> 04:28:44.359 align:start position:0%
which is a nonpartisan Coalition uh
 
04:28:45.910 --> 04:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
devoted to expanding and protecting
 
04:28:47.870 --> 04:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
voter access and it's a project of
 
04:28:50.870 --> 04:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
America votes New Hampshire um we are
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
opposing uh HB 1369 today we'll say we
 
04:28:58.830 --> 04:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
do believe in cleaner checklists and the
 
04:29:00.349 --> 04:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
efforts that are needed to make our
 
04:29:02.670 --> 04:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
checklist cleaner in New Hampshire
 
04:29:05.309 --> 04:29:05.319 align:start position:0%
however there are ways to do that Beyond
 
04:29:06.990 --> 04:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh expanding the number of times we
 
04:29:09.429 --> 04:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
remove folks who are not voting and
 
04:29:12.510 --> 04:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
maybe miss one presidential election um
 
04:29:14.109 --> 04:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
other ways I know secretary just
 
04:29:15.910 --> 04:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned the national change of address
 
04:29:18.269 --> 04:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
data that is a better way to capture
 
04:29:21.189 --> 04:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
people who are moving and no longer live
 
04:29:23.429 --> 04:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
um where they formerly registered as
 
04:29:25.109 --> 04:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
opposed to folks who again might have
 
04:29:27.229 --> 04:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
missed one presidential election know
 
04:29:28.950 --> 04:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
the election information portal is also
 
04:29:30.630 --> 04:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
moving through the legislature it's
 
04:29:32.950 --> 04:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
another way for folks to update their
 
04:29:35.070 --> 04:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
addresses when they move keeping those
 
04:29:37.630 --> 04:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
lists cleaner and focusing on address as
 
04:29:39.870 --> 04:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to missing an election and then
 
04:29:41.830 --> 04:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
being unknowingly move removed from a
 
04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
list um and I believe this committee
 
04:29:46.070 --> 04:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
will also be hearing later uh in the
 
04:29:47.269 --> 04:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
session about the electronic
 
04:29:50.030 --> 04:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
registration information center um which
 
04:29:52.070 --> 04:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
will track folks if they move out of
 
04:29:53.790 --> 04:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
state are no longer eligible to vote in
 
04:29:55.870 --> 04:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and those are all ways
 
04:29:57.510 --> 04:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
that we would support in terms of
 
04:29:59.389 --> 04:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
keeping our checklist cleaner more
 
04:30:01.750 --> 04:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
updated and capturing folks when they
 
04:30:04.389 --> 04:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
are no longer uh able to vote because
 
04:30:06.229 --> 04:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
they've moved out of where they formerly
 
04:30:09.149 --> 04:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
domiciled as opposed to removing folks
 
04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
more frequently just because of lack of
 
04:30:14.269 --> 04:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
voting um and not necessarily because we
 
04:30:16.189 --> 04:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
have the information that they are no
 
04:30:18.830 --> 04:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
longer eligible to vote I'm not an
 
04:30:21.030 --> 04:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
expert on the checklist process was
 
04:30:22.630 --> 04:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
trying to keep track the years and
 
04:30:24.269 --> 04:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
thinking what presidential election is
 
04:30:26.429 --> 04:30:26.439 align:start position:0%
what but if there are questions uh I can
 
04:30:30.109 --> 04:30:30.119 align:start position:0%
try to answer them questions from the
 
04:30:32.510 --> 04:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you thank
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
you last up is Daniel
 
04:30:34.640 --> 04:30:44.670 align:start position:0%
you last up is Daniel
Healey

04:30:44.670 --> 04:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:45.990 --> 04:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
represent AR can you go and grab that
 
04:30:49.070 --> 04:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:53.109 --> 04:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
me hi Dan hilly uh NAA city clerk uh
 
04:30:54.670 --> 04:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire City and town
 
04:30:54.680 --> 04:30:55.630 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire City and town
clerk's

04:30:55.630 --> 04:30:55.640 align:start position:0%
clerk's
 
04:30:58.550 --> 04:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
Association uh we are in support of uh
 
04:31:01.710 --> 04:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
this legislation we do agree with uh
 
04:31:03.710 --> 04:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
going down from the 10 years to the four
 
04:31:06.750 --> 04:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
years uh to keep the voter lists as
 
04:31:09.189 --> 04:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
accurate as possible uh there are some
 
04:31:12.269 --> 04:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
other things that occur when you know
 
04:31:13.590 --> 04:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
you get a certain amount of Voters
 
04:31:17.149 --> 04:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
removed we're required to set up um a
 
04:31:19.229 --> 04:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
specific amount of voting booths per
 
04:31:22.590 --> 04:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
voter so if the lists aren't accurate we
 
04:31:25.030 --> 04:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
might need 60 more voting booths to
 
04:31:28.510 --> 04:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
support the the what's on our checklist
 
04:31:30.429 --> 04:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
so there are some things that from our
 
04:31:33.630 --> 04:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
end tie into this this voter checklist
 
04:31:37.870 --> 04:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
being the most accurate as possible um I
 
04:31:39.870 --> 04:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
was in another Community for the last
 
04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
Purge and we purged about 6,000 voters
 
04:31:44.910 --> 04:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of work for the supervisor
 
04:31:47.189 --> 04:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
of the checklist to be to be doing to be
 
04:31:50.790 --> 04:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
mailing those out and that 6,000 people
 
04:31:52.750 --> 04:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh would amount to in that election
 
04:31:54.429 --> 04:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
prior would have been 60 less voting
 
04:31:56.510 --> 04:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
boosts that needed to be set up so there
 
04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
are some tie-ins to to those sorts of
 
04:32:01.630 --> 04:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
things we do uh the national change of
 
04:32:03.550 --> 04:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
address we do the 30-day letters if
 
04:32:05.750 --> 04:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
we're notified someone has moved moved
 
04:32:08.910 --> 04:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
out um we match uh death records we do
 
04:32:10.630 --> 04:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
all that stuff but I think this is
 
04:32:13.030 --> 04:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
another layer this is another step that
 
04:32:15.070 --> 04:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
helps us get to that goal of keeping the
 
04:32:18.030 --> 04:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
voter list as accurate as possible um
 
04:32:20.030 --> 04:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
and if someone's not voting with in a
 
04:32:22.030 --> 04:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
four-year time frame I mean I think
 
04:32:24.070 --> 04:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's long enough that they should
 
04:32:26.229 --> 04:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
probably should be removed at that point
 
04:32:28.030 --> 04:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
they have the option New Hampshire has
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
same day voter registration they can
 
04:32:32.269 --> 04:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
come to the polls they can re-register
 
04:32:34.389 --> 04:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
so we we do have all those options for
 
04:32:37.309 --> 04:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
the voters um I do see some of the other
 
04:32:39.790 --> 04:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
the the arguments on the other side but
 
04:32:41.469 --> 04:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire with that same day
 
04:32:43.550 --> 04:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
registration we're not disenfranchising
 
04:32:46.229 --> 04:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
anyone and we're keeping the voter lists
 
04:32:48.670 --> 04:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
um as accurate as possible for that that
 
04:32:51.309 --> 04:32:51.319 align:start position:0%
moment in time so I'd be open to any
 
04:32:53.149 --> 04:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the committee
 
04:32:57.070 --> 04:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you um in
 
04:32:59.349 --> 04:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
in that instance in in just referencing
 
04:33:01.910 --> 04:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
the same day voter registration if we do
 
04:33:05.990 --> 04:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
these purges more often
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that increase the amount of
 
04:33:11.869 --> 04:33:11.879 align:start position:0%
same potentially increase the same day
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
voter registrations and thus create more
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
work for the supervisors of the
 
04:33:18.590 --> 04:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
checklist on an already busy day on
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
Election Day it it has the potential to
 
04:33:24.230 --> 04:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
increase the same day registrations I
 
04:33:27.709 --> 04:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
think um a good check is you know the
 
04:33:29.789 --> 04:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
four years where there's a presidential
 
04:33:32.750 --> 04:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
election in November I think um that's
 
04:33:34.629 --> 04:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
the election we have our highest turnout
 
04:33:36.109 --> 04:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
so if someone's not
 
04:33:38.269 --> 04:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
say voting in that election I don't know
 
04:33:40.949 --> 04:33:40.959 align:start position:0%
how often they they will be um
 
04:33:43.390 --> 04:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
participating in elections so there
 
04:33:45.269 --> 04:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
could be some additional same day
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
registrations there's could be some
 
04:33:49.590 --> 04:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
people that we remove that will then end
 
04:33:51.510 --> 04:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
up registering again I don't see it
 
04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
being a real high amount um we have a
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
lot of people that vote in every
 
04:33:57.150 --> 04:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
election we have some people that only
 
04:33:59.910 --> 04:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
vote you know the every four years but
 
04:34:01.949 --> 04:34:01.959 align:start position:0%
with the same day registration they have
 
04:34:04.070 --> 04:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
that option I don't think it's going to
 
04:34:06.070 --> 04:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
you know bog down the line
 
04:34:09.709 --> 04:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
uh for those people followup please we
 
04:34:11.029 --> 04:34:11.039 align:start position:0%
got to go over to represent Burnham
 
04:34:13.551 --> 04:34:13.561 align:start position:0%
first unless she wants to yield I can
 
04:34:15.910 --> 04:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
yield for her followup that's
 
04:34:19.310 --> 04:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
fine thank you
 
04:34:19.320 --> 04:34:21.551 align:start position:0%
fine thank you
um

04:34:21.551 --> 04:34:21.561 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:23.551 --> 04:34:23.561 align:start position:0%
oh all right back to representative
 
04:34:25.990 --> 04:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
bernon thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:34:28.029 --> 04:34:28.039 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you had mentioned
 
04:34:30.470 --> 04:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
that there were about 6,000 Purge in the
 
04:34:33.709 --> 04:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
last um 10e cycle there I was just
 
04:34:36.429 --> 04:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
wondering if it's uh would be helpful to
 
04:34:39.189 --> 04:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
know how you would set up for voting day
 
04:34:41.709 --> 04:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
would that also help reduce the cost of
 
04:34:43.629 --> 04:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
uh printing ballots and having those
 
04:34:46.670 --> 04:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
available for election so those numbers
 
04:34:49.109 --> 04:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
would tie in uh in state and federal
 
04:34:50.670 --> 04:34:50.680 align:start position:0%
elections the secretary of state
 
04:34:53.109 --> 04:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
provides the municipalities with the
 
04:34:56.070 --> 04:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
amount of ballots and they look at uh
 
04:34:58.390 --> 04:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
the number of registered voters and they
 
04:34:59.990 --> 04:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
obviously do a percentage higher than
 
04:35:03.590 --> 04:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
that uh figuring in for uh any same day
 
04:35:05.590 --> 04:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
registrations but they use the numbers
 
04:35:07.949 --> 04:35:07.959 align:start position:0%
that are in the election system to kind
 
04:35:10.269 --> 04:35:10.279 align:start position:0%
of calculate how many ballots um they
 
04:35:12.670 --> 04:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
should be producing for us in in the
 
04:35:14.551 --> 04:35:14.561 align:start position:0%
municipal election I'm looking at the
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
same thing how many uh registered voters
 
04:35:18.551 --> 04:35:18.561 align:start position:0%
do we have in each Ward so I know how
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
many ballots to order so if the numbers
 
04:35:24.910 --> 04:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
are inflated for you know um people that
 
04:35:27.230 --> 04:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
were reg you know registered at one
 
04:35:29.910 --> 04:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
point that aren't actually going to vote
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
or have moved then we have to more order
 
04:35:36.029 --> 04:35:36.039 align:start position:0%
more ballots and it costs more money so
 
04:35:40.029 --> 04:35:40.039 align:start position:0%
that it does tie into a few of these
 
04:35:40.039 --> 04:35:41.949 align:start position:0%
that it does tie into a few of these
things

04:35:41.949 --> 04:35:41.959 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:35:45.029 --> 04:35:45.039 align:start position:0%
followup um I'm not sure if this
 
04:35:46.590 --> 04:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
pertains to you but we were talking
 
04:35:50.590 --> 04:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
about um additional costs of um possibly
 
04:35:53.670 --> 04:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
purging on a more frequent basis um are
 
04:35:56.990 --> 04:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
you aware if the checklist supervisors
 
04:35:59.670 --> 04:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
that are elected are being paid by hour
 
04:36:02.109 --> 04:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
or is it just like a stip in so it
 
04:36:04.670 --> 04:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
varies by uh what the municipality wants
 
04:36:07.830 --> 04:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
to do some are hourly some uh get a
 
04:36:11.869 --> 04:36:11.879 align:start position:0%
stipended um in a city clerk's office uh
 
04:36:15.551 --> 04:36:15.561 align:start position:0%
my staff would be the ones managing uh
 
04:36:15.561 --> 04:36:16.269 align:start position:0%
my staff would be the ones managing uh
the

04:36:16.269 --> 04:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:19.150 --> 04:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
day-to-day uh of of removing the voters
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
and then it would go to the board of
 
04:36:22.750 --> 04:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
registrants for approval so it really
 
04:36:25.150 --> 04:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
depends on what the municipality is
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
structured some pay their registrars $10
 
04:36:31.629 --> 04:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
some get a few hundred stien per month
 
04:36:34.390 --> 04:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's it it varies across the state it's
 
04:36:38.310 --> 04:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:41.910 --> 04:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
uniform okay any uh representative PR
 
04:36:43.390 --> 04:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank
 
04:36:46.750 --> 04:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
you uh you talked about a purge of 6,000
 
04:36:49.551 --> 04:36:49.561 align:start position:0%
voters um I think that was Derry that
 
04:36:52.709 --> 04:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
was yeah were were there any problems in
 
04:36:55.830 --> 04:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
the election after that with uh
 
04:36:58.269 --> 04:36:58.279 align:start position:0%
registering people to vote if they had
 
04:37:01.990 --> 04:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
been inadvertently removed uh and still
 
04:37:03.629 --> 04:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
lived in town for example just didn't
 
04:37:05.830 --> 04:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
vote for a long time and
 
04:37:07.310 --> 04:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
with the supervisors of the checklist
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
were there any problems at the next um
 
04:37:12.349 --> 04:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
election I don't believe in the uh
 
04:37:13.949 --> 04:37:13.959 align:start position:0%
following elections that there are any
 
04:37:15.990 --> 04:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
major issues sometimes you would have
 
04:37:18.029 --> 04:37:18.039 align:start position:0%
the occasional person that would you
 
04:37:19.830 --> 04:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
either request an absentee ball or show
 
04:37:21.551 --> 04:37:21.561 align:start position:0%
up at the polling location and say that
 
04:37:24.269 --> 04:37:24.279 align:start position:0%
they had registered prior and then when
 
04:37:26.990 --> 04:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
it was explained to them the process and
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
what had occurred uh they seemed okay
 
04:37:31.349 --> 04:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
with that then they would re-register I
 
04:37:35.070 --> 04:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
don't recall an overwhelming um amount
 
04:37:38.470 --> 04:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
of Voters or um a ton of complaints
 
04:37:40.990 --> 04:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
regarding it but there were probably you
 
04:37:43.230 --> 04:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
know there were some that were Purge
 
04:37:48.150 --> 04:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:50.670 --> 04:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
re-registering representative Brennan
 
04:37:54.150 --> 04:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you would the clerks Association
 
04:37:57.470 --> 04:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
be okay with the secretary's
 
04:37:59.869 --> 04:37:59.879 align:start position:0%
recommendation of an amendment to six
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
years or do you hold firm at
 
04:38:03.920 --> 04:38:05.910 align:start position:0%
years or do you hold firm at
four

04:38:05.910 --> 04:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:38:07.349 --> 04:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
I believe the Secretary of State's
 
04:38:10.390 --> 04:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
office made some some good points uh
 
04:38:14.429 --> 04:38:14.439 align:start position:0%
without speaking with our committee um
 
04:38:16.830 --> 04:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
directly I I don't know if I could fully
 
04:38:18.910 --> 04:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
answer that I mean I
 
04:38:21.709 --> 04:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
think our thoughts on the initial bill
 
04:38:25.189 --> 04:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
was that it was a good a good bill um
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
four years does seem reasonable but I
 
04:38:28.789 --> 04:38:28.799 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for the entire
 
04:38:32.150 --> 04:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
committee without um without discussing
 
04:38:34.709 --> 04:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
it with them but I I think we were
 
04:38:36.510 --> 04:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty satisfied with the four
 
04:38:38.709 --> 04:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
years good thank
 
04:38:40.910 --> 04:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
you pres
 
04:38:43.269 --> 04:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you and thanks for taking my
 
04:38:46.269 --> 04:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
question um a lot of your answers have
 
04:38:48.230 --> 04:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
been conditioned on the fact that same
 
04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
day registration exists and it's pretty
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
routine and can be handled what if that
 
04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
did not
 
04:38:57.949 --> 04:38:57.959 align:start position:0%
exist I if there was no same day
 
04:38:59.869 --> 04:38:59.879 align:start position:0%
registration I think a lot of the other
 
04:39:02.189 --> 04:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
laws would need to be looked at to
 
04:39:04.470 --> 04:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
provide some opportunity for these
 
04:39:04.480 --> 04:39:05.590 align:start position:0%
provide some opportunity for these
voters

04:39:05.590 --> 04:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
voters
 
04:39:08.750 --> 04:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
so with the current law as it is I I
 
04:39:11.230 --> 04:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
think the four years is you know is a
 
04:39:16.510 --> 04:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
good time frame for those okay thank you
 
04:39:19.470 --> 04:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
further questions all right seeing none
 
04:39:21.510 --> 04:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
where you want back up you want more uh
 
04:39:24.470 --> 04:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
while you're up there so I did some
 
04:39:26.750 --> 04:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
quick math on the there's going to be a
 
04:39:29.390 --> 04:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
surge of people same day registering so
 
04:39:30.349 --> 04:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
after the
 
04:39:33.551 --> 04:39:33.561 align:start position:0%
2021 Purge there was a 4% same day
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
registration before for The Purge there
 
04:39:37.470 --> 04:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
was a 9% same registration now midly
 
04:39:39.510 --> 04:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
this is two elections uh correlation is
 
04:39:42.350 --> 04:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
not causation um but on Face Value the
 
04:39:46.030 --> 04:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
argument is moot um representative weing
 
04:39:49.110 --> 04:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
yes um the discussion has reminded me of
 
04:39:51.190 --> 04:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
the rationale for the four years and the
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
four-year look back it's cycled so that
 
04:39:57.190 --> 04:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
so I think everyone knows that we get
 
04:39:58.670 --> 04:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
much greater turnout during the
 
04:40:01.830 --> 04:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
presidential elections every four years
 
04:40:06.270 --> 04:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
comparatively lower um on other
 
04:40:10.750 --> 04:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
intervals um this would look back um
 
04:40:14.190 --> 04:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
prior to the year prior to the next
 
04:40:17.310 --> 04:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
presidential election it looks back four
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
years and so would include the
 
04:40:22.510 --> 04:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
previous presidential election and so
 
04:40:25.708 --> 04:40:25.718 align:start position:0%
you have the best chance and opportunity
 
04:40:28.788 --> 04:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
of capturing the greatest voter turnout
 
04:40:31.788 --> 04:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
that occurred in that community in that
 
04:40:35.350 --> 04:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
thing I I do not think that the six-year
 
04:40:39.230 --> 04:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
cycle would accomplish that so um I W
 
04:40:41.150 --> 04:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
during the discussion I was reminded of
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
the rationale for that so I wanted to um
 
04:40:47.150 --> 04:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
add that to the
 
04:40:50.628 --> 04:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
testimony okay all right um thank you I
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
think that's it um uh okay uh in person
 
04:40:56.190 --> 04:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
there were three people signed up to
 
04:40:58.350 --> 04:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
speak uh sorry there was ah five people
 
04:41:00.190 --> 04:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
signed up who didn't speak three support
 
04:41:03.990 --> 04:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
to opposed online little lopsided uh it
 
04:41:07.430 --> 04:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
was 17 support 70 oppose and one neutral
 
04:41:09.590 --> 04:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
I would love to meet the neutral person
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
um with that going to close the public
 
04:41:14.510 --> 04:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1369 to open up
 
04:41:17.430 --> 04:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 1442 FN
 
04:41:19.430 --> 04:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the penalties for failures
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
for election officers to adhere to
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
election law uh and I believe
 
04:41:26.150 --> 04:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative kushman are you
 
04:41:26.160 --> 04:41:28.628 align:start position:0%

introducing

04:41:28.628 --> 04:41:28.638 align:start position:0%

wear I am introducing this bill on
 
04:41:45.030 --> 04:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of the sponsor as she had um some
 
04:41:46.990 --> 04:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
urgent personal business to attend to
 
04:41:49.230 --> 04:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
and asked me to do that for her uh that
 
04:41:51.190 --> 04:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
being said I may not be able to answer
 
04:41:54.470 --> 04:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
any technical questions but I'll do my
 
04:41:58.270 --> 04:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
best uh the bill before you HB
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%

04:42:05.280 --> 04:42:06.550 align:start position:0%
1442 adds one new section J to RSA 65 9
colon

04:42:06.550 --> 04:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
colon
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
34 that includes election
 
04:42:14.270 --> 04:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
officers um under the penalties for
 
04:42:17.708 --> 04:42:17.718 align:start position:0%
voter fraud and for being uh liable for
 
04:42:21.550 --> 04:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
those penalties uh for any violation of
 
04:42:25.110 --> 04:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
any election law in any
 
04:42:28.350 --> 04:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
election and the reason for this bill um
 
04:42:30.390 --> 04:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's in the spirit of raising voter
 
04:42:34.070 --> 04:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
confidence as we know um many voters are
 
04:42:34.080 --> 04:42:35.230 align:start position:0%
confidence as we know um many voters are
feeling

04:42:35.230 --> 04:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
feeling
 
04:42:37.948 --> 04:42:37.958 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised by uh what they perceive
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
to be some uh deficiencies in the voting
 
04:42:45.430 --> 04:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
system in our election system in New
 
04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so amending and clarifying RSA
 
04:42:52.350 --> 04:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
3 uh 659 colon 34 to include them as
 
04:42:54.750 --> 04:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
responsible parties uh for voter
 
04:42:57.830 --> 04:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
registration authentication is very
 
04:43:01.390 --> 04:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
important um election officers those
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
processing some uh same day voter
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
registrations supervisors of the
 
04:43:09.430 --> 04:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
checklists election moderators Etc will
 
04:43:11.230 --> 04:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
be required to be held to the same legal
 
04:43:13.190 --> 04:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
standard as those presenting as
 
04:43:16.310 --> 04:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
qualified voters voters will be assured
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
that the Personnel entrusted to oversee
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
all elections in their municipalities
 
04:43:22.510 --> 04:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
are performing their duties with
 
04:43:24.470 --> 04:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
integrity and in accordance with all
 
04:43:27.510 --> 04:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
applicable election statutes and voters
 
04:43:28.830 --> 04:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
will know that there are uniform
 
04:43:30.628 --> 04:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
penalties for knowingly violating
 
04:43:32.948 --> 04:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
election laws therefore removing the
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
veil of Suspicion and skep
 
04:43:37.708 --> 04:43:37.718 align:start position:0%
iism that some voters currently focus on
 
04:43:40.390 --> 04:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
the hardworking election officials by
 
04:43:42.430 --> 04:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
implementing this amended language we
 
04:43:43.708 --> 04:43:43.718 align:start position:0%
will continue to demonstrate to the
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
voters that New Hampshire takes election
 
04:43:48.230 --> 04:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
integrity and security
 
04:43:50.788 --> 04:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
seriously and I'd ask the committee to
 
04:43:54.350 --> 04:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
support uh the bill as introduced and
 
04:43:56.670 --> 04:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
I'll try to answer any questions okay
 
04:43:57.990 --> 04:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:44:03.070 --> 04:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:06.868 --> 04:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:09.628 --> 04:44:09.638 align:start position:0%

04:44:12.030 --> 04:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
sorry I know that's well I got short

arms please um so uh thank you Mr chair
 
04:44:20.030 --> 04:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um so
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
any election law how
 
04:44:26.788 --> 04:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
how broad in scope is that is that you
 
04:44:28.750 --> 04:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
know if if they forget to
 
04:44:32.750 --> 04:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
post um if the moderator forgets to post
 
04:44:34.910 --> 04:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
a list um
 
04:44:37.628 --> 04:44:37.638 align:start position:0%
exactly the way the law prescribes for
 
04:44:40.750 --> 04:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
example would that be considered a
 
04:44:43.150 --> 04:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
violation I'm I'm just concerned that it
 
04:44:47.110 --> 04:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
might be too broad um comments on that
 
04:44:48.830 --> 04:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I was just
 
04:44:52.628 --> 04:44:52.638 align:start position:0%
going to pull up the statute to see what
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's covering
 
04:44:57.430 --> 04:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
um it looks like it's called penalties
 
04:45:01.868 --> 04:45:01.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:05.788 --> 04:45:05.798 align:start position:0%
fraud um
 
04:45:09.190 --> 04:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I'm looking for
 
04:45:12.868 --> 04:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
5934 you're right it's wrongful voting
 
04:45:16.070 --> 04:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
penalties for voter fraud is the
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
section and if you don't mind I'll just
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
read a couple of the other things under
 
04:45:22.110 --> 04:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
that section for the committee um a
 
04:45:24.270 --> 04:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
person is subject to a civil penalty not
 
04:45:28.230 --> 04:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
to exceed $5,000 if such person and then
 
04:45:30.750 --> 04:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
there's you know some some violations
 
04:45:32.230 --> 04:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
they could make when registering to vote
 
04:45:34.470 --> 04:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
if they vote more than once um if
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
there's fraud in their um voter
 
04:45:39.628 --> 04:45:39.638 align:start position:0%
registration if they apply for a ballot
 
04:45:42.110 --> 04:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
in the name of others uh apply for a
 
04:45:43.990 --> 04:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
ballot in their own name after they
 
04:45:46.030 --> 04:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
voted already if they voted for an
 
04:45:47.628 --> 04:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
office or measure at an election they're
 
04:45:49.910 --> 04:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
not qualified to vote at gives a false
 
04:45:50.910 --> 04:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
name or
 
04:45:55.670 --> 04:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
answer um or presents falsified proof of
 
04:45:59.390 --> 04:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
identity so it seems that it falls under
 
04:46:02.708 --> 04:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
specifically um managing who is eligible
 
04:46:04.830 --> 04:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
to vote and who is not
 
04:46:06.910 --> 04:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
is how I read
 
04:46:06.920 --> 04:46:08.430 align:start position:0%
is how I read
it

04:46:08.430 --> 04:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:46:12.110 --> 04:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
followup so uh do
 
04:46:14.948 --> 04:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
you think the sponsor and co-sponsors
 
04:46:18.350 --> 04:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
might be amendable to something akin to
 
04:46:20.470 --> 04:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
performs as an election officer and any
 
04:46:23.230 --> 04:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
election and facilitates wrongful voting
 
04:46:27.750 --> 04:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
and voter fraud just to narrow that the
 
04:46:30.270 --> 04:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
scope of it so that the enforcement is
 
04:46:32.868 --> 04:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
not directed for you know equivalent
 
04:46:35.030 --> 04:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors if you will but but is
 
04:46:37.590 --> 04:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
really addressing the felonies again
 
04:46:37.600 --> 04:46:39.110 align:start position:0%
really addressing the felonies again
analogy

04:46:39.110 --> 04:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
analogy
 
04:46:42.670 --> 04:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
wise to me that sounds reasonable um I
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
can't speak for the co-sponsor but she's
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:52.470 --> 04:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
experience representative Raptor thank
 
04:46:53.948 --> 04:46:53.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I don't know why the
 
04:46:55.470 --> 04:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
statement got me in your in your
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
testimony you said uh knowingly violates
 
04:47:01.830 --> 04:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
a law but this as proposed doesn't have
 
04:47:04.670 --> 04:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
that it just says and violates
 
04:47:07.190 --> 04:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
um would it be reasonable to include
 
04:47:10.350 --> 04:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
knowingly prior to
 
04:47:13.788 --> 04:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question um I
 
04:47:16.350 --> 04:47:16.360 align:start position:0%
think it would be probably reasonable
 
04:47:19.150 --> 04:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
however all of the election officials
 
04:47:23.750 --> 04:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
are trained so they do receive the laws
 
04:47:26.230 --> 04:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
they know what they're supposed to do um
 
04:47:28.948 --> 04:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
so I think it would be if it came to a
 
04:47:31.150 --> 04:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
jury and they were adjudicating and they
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
were fact finding on this if they were
 
04:47:34.830 --> 04:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
to try to say that they didn't know and
 
04:47:37.030 --> 04:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
they were trained election officials
 
04:47:38.910 --> 04:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
even if the statute said knowingly I see
 
04:47:40.510 --> 04:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
it as they wouldn't really be able to
 
04:47:42.868 --> 04:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
get out of they wouldn't be able to say
 
04:47:45.030 --> 04:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
they didn't know but that's that's how I
 
04:47:45.040 --> 04:47:47.948 align:start position:0%
they didn't know but that's that's how I
read

04:47:47.948 --> 04:47:47.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:52.750 --> 04:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
it further questions seeing none thank
 
04:47:55.070 --> 04:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
you she's waving she's waving off all
 
04:47:57.070 --> 04:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative kushman
 
04:47:59.548 --> 04:47:59.558 align:start position:0%
um next up is McKenzie St Germaine we
 
04:48:01.310 --> 04:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
also did get reloaded on pink cards
 
04:48:04.830 --> 04:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Vice chairman B um and
 
04:48:11.628 --> 04:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:13.868 --> 04:48:13.878 align:start position:0%
said hello again uh members of the
 
04:48:15.708 --> 04:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
committee again I'm McKenzie St Germaine
 
04:48:17.070 --> 04:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire campaign for
 
04:48:18.510 --> 04:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
voting rights and America votes New
 
04:48:21.430 --> 04:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um here today to oppose House
 
04:48:21.440 --> 04:48:22.270 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um here today to oppose House
Bill

04:48:22.270 --> 04:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:48:24.868 --> 04:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
1442 you know we know and heard in front
 
04:48:26.190 --> 04:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
of this committee many times that New
 
04:48:29.230 --> 04:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire elections are safe secure and
 
04:48:31.230 --> 04:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
that is in large part to the work of our
 
04:48:33.590 --> 04:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
election officials uh in state
 
04:48:34.990 --> 04:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
especially because we have a very
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
decentralized system our towns and
 
04:48:38.708 --> 04:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
cities are really run and those
 
04:48:40.868 --> 04:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
elections are run by the election
 
04:48:43.470 --> 04:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
officials they are not in it for the
 
04:48:46.590 --> 04:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
glamour or clout or paycheck that they
 
04:48:48.310 --> 04:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
get from those roles they're in those
 
04:48:50.990 --> 04:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
roles for the public service um and
 
04:48:53.070 --> 04:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
being able to carry out democracy at the
 
04:48:56.110 --> 04:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
most local level in state and this takes
 
04:48:58.510 --> 04:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of election officials um
 
04:49:00.150 --> 04:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
volunteers I know there were certain
 
04:49:02.830 --> 04:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
pulling places with over 100 volunte or
 
04:49:05.430 --> 04:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
cities over 100 unteers running our
 
04:49:07.470 --> 04:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
elections um and these folks are
 
04:49:10.390 --> 04:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
increasingly under a microscope uh
 
04:49:12.310 --> 04:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
there's some national surveys of
 
04:49:15.390 --> 04:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
election officials um in April of
 
04:49:17.830 --> 04:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
2023 research conducted by the Brennan
 
04:49:20.310 --> 04:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
Center for justice said nearly three in
 
04:49:22.390 --> 04:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
four election officials reported that
 
04:49:23.990 --> 04:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
they felt threats against them had
 
04:49:26.830 --> 04:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
increased in recent years and 30%
 
04:49:28.750 --> 04:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
surveyed uh reported that they had been
 
04:49:31.350 --> 04:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
personally abused harassed or threatened
 
04:49:33.990 --> 04:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
due to their role um thankfully in in
 
04:49:36.070 --> 04:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have not seen quite the
 
04:49:39.390 --> 04:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
same level of resignation and turnovers
 
04:49:41.548 --> 04:49:41.558 align:start position:0%
from election officials however if we
 
04:49:44.670 --> 04:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
were to see this bill become law um and
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
election officials operating in an
 
04:49:48.948 --> 04:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
environment where any mistake they made
 
04:49:50.470 --> 04:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
could land them with a voter fraud
 
04:49:53.030 --> 04:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
charge I think that would put us at risk
 
04:49:55.868 --> 04:49:55.878 align:start position:0%
for those similar kind of Trends and um
 
04:49:58.190 --> 04:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
even more resignations folks not being
 
04:50:01.548 --> 04:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
willing to do Public Service in order to
 
04:50:04.270 --> 04:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
carry out our democracy uh for risk of
 
04:50:06.868 --> 04:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
being hit with voter fraud charges uh
 
04:50:08.310 --> 04:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
would like to remind this committee as
 
04:50:10.230 --> 04:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
well that currently at least the last
 
04:50:12.470 --> 04:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
election the election procedure manual
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
was over 400 pages so although our
 
04:50:17.310 --> 04:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
election officials are trained this bill
 
04:50:19.470 --> 04:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
does not you know lay out that it would
 
04:50:22.948 --> 04:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
have to be some sort of a intentional
 
04:50:25.310 --> 04:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
you know charge and sort of intentional
 
04:50:28.548 --> 04:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
mistake um is any of those things as the
 
04:50:30.390 --> 04:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
law is written in or the bill is written
 
04:50:34.350 --> 04:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
in those 400 plus pages of procedures um
 
04:50:36.230 --> 04:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
and generally you know if our election
 
04:50:39.110 --> 04:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
volunteers and officials who want to
 
04:50:40.948 --> 04:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
serve their communities are legally
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
responsible for mistakes I think again
 
04:50:45.430 --> 04:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
we could see there will not be willing
 
04:50:47.910 --> 04:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
to serve in those very important roles
 
04:50:49.470 --> 04:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
that are the backbone of our New
 
04:50:52.310 --> 04:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire elections so um with that we
 
04:50:54.868 --> 04:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
ask that you uh recommend in expedient
 
04:50:56.868 --> 04:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
to legislate on hp1
 
04:50:59.910 --> 04:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
1442 and I happy to answer questions
 
04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
04:51:07.230 --> 04:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:11.390 --> 04:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
Michael last name man uh excuse me Mr
 
04:51:13.548 --> 04:51:13.558 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I just have a quick
 
04:51:16.868 --> 04:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry about the bill uh
 
04:51:22.110 --> 04:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
so under RSA 654 34 there's no penalty
 
04:51:23.868 --> 04:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
outlined in the
 
04:51:26.590 --> 04:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
RSA and yeah this is uh this is say
 
04:51:28.350 --> 04:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
something you bring up in exec okay yeah
 
04:51:30.350 --> 04:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
you can't a parliamentary inquiry is not
 
04:51:31.910 --> 04:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
used to discuss the bill a parliamentary
 
04:51:33.390 --> 04:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
inquiry is used to discuss actions of
 
04:51:36.548 --> 04:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
the chair I had I just wanted to know if
 
04:51:38.990 --> 04:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh just for some clarification on that
 
04:51:40.548 --> 04:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
yeah you have now that that is totally
 
04:51:41.868 --> 04:51:41.878 align:start position:0%
something that you can ask any of the
 
04:51:43.868 --> 04:51:43.878 align:start position:0%
people testifying that's a totally fair
 
04:51:46.750 --> 04:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
question just not me just all right
 
04:51:49.390 --> 04:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
we'll try again Michael um how your last
 
04:51:51.070 --> 04:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
name I have trouble reading
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:02.638 --> 04:52:06.868 align:start position:0%
 
Bean

04:52:06.868 --> 04:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:09.510 --> 04:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
gotta hit that hit that button is that
 
04:52:12.270 --> 04:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
working I come in support of
 
04:52:15.590 --> 04:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
1442 um I got really deeply involved in
 
04:52:18.590 --> 04:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
elections during the District 24 recount
 
04:52:22.990 --> 04:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
and um saw things that made my head
 
04:52:25.430 --> 04:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
spin uh much of it was documented
 
04:52:27.350 --> 04:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
through the require through um request
 
04:52:32.548 --> 04:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
of 91a but as recently as January 23rd I
 
04:52:34.470 --> 04:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
I have witnessed
 
04:52:36.670 --> 04:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh election law
 
04:52:40.030 --> 04:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
violation and it's ongoing and it's not
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
being corrected the Attorney General's
 
04:52:44.910 --> 04:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
office really has its hands tied unless
 
04:52:48.510 --> 04:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature imposes an opportunity
 
04:52:52.708 --> 04:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
to to fine and and stop some of what is
 
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
taking place uh
 
04:52:59.310 --> 04:52:59.320 align:start position:0%
without the uh house and the Senate
 
04:53:00.788 --> 04:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
acting and
 
04:53:04.230 --> 04:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
imposing some kind of fines
 
04:53:06.750 --> 04:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
this is never ever going to resolve
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
itself so um we've witnessed rsas being
 
04:53:13.190 --> 04:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
violated over and over again I can give
 
04:53:16.150 --> 04:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
you very specific examples I have a a
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
book here full of it and as I said I
 
04:53:22.590 --> 04:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
witnessed it again on January 23rd uh
 
04:53:24.708 --> 04:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
meeting requirements of rsas for testing
 
04:53:27.150 --> 04:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
ballots for example you're required to
 
04:53:29.430 --> 04:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
put ballots through a machine face up
 
04:53:31.110 --> 04:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
forward and backward face down forward
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
and backward the ballot doesn't go
 
04:53:35.230 --> 04:53:35.240 align:start position:0%
through through I see the ballot turned
 
04:53:36.990 --> 04:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
and it gets sent through the same way it
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
was sent previously does nothing to
 
04:53:44.750 --> 04:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
validate the test I have uh been to the
 
04:53:48.110 --> 04:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office with our uh
 
04:53:51.868 --> 04:53:51.878 align:start position:0%
RSA required activity logs to be filled
 
04:53:54.670 --> 04:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
out completely which weren't they aren't
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
signed they aren't witnessed twice
 
04:53:58.868 --> 04:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
this's very little documentation there
 
04:54:00.990 --> 04:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
are Cod numbers missing on the activity
 
04:54:05.230 --> 04:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
files the SEC uh attorne General did an
 
04:54:07.788 --> 04:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
investigation and the next time I walked
 
04:54:09.510 --> 04:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
into my town
 
04:54:12.230 --> 04:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
hall uh my my Town's folk met me and
 
04:54:14.990 --> 04:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
said yep we got our slap on the wrist
 
04:54:16.708 --> 04:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that and life
 
04:54:21.150 --> 04:54:21.160 align:start position:0%
goes on so unless we do something about
 
04:54:25.270 --> 04:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
it via penalty it's it it's not going to
 
04:54:26.788 --> 04:54:26.798 align:start position:0%
get corrected there's a lot of human
 
04:54:29.150 --> 04:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
nature out there if you don't have a a a
 
04:54:32.110 --> 04:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
policeman enforcing a speed limit then
 
04:54:34.190 --> 04:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
people tend to speed if he out there
 
04:54:36.548 --> 04:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
they tend to slow down we need to do
 
04:54:39.030 --> 04:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
something there's nothing more important
 
04:54:41.510 --> 04:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
than our elections and I heard uh
 
04:54:43.948 --> 04:54:43.958 align:start position:0%
previous testimony that our elections
 
04:54:47.190 --> 04:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
are uh fair safe and secure and there is
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
no evidence of that and there's never
 
04:54:51.708 --> 04:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
been an investigation there was a
 
04:54:53.470 --> 04:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
confidence committee established but
 
04:54:55.830 --> 04:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
there was never an investigation if you
 
04:54:58.110 --> 04:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
investigate and you see what's wrong
 
04:55:00.350 --> 04:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
then something has to be done about it
 
04:55:02.470 --> 04:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
this went before the ballot law
 
04:55:04.030 --> 04:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
commission they referred it to the
 
04:55:06.070 --> 04:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office we've not
 
04:55:08.310 --> 04:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
heard back from them yet there has been
 
04:55:09.910 --> 04:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
no investigation to the best of my
 
04:55:12.070 --> 04:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge yet and this you're open to
 
04:55:14.270 --> 04:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
seeing anything you'd like to see in
 
04:55:17.350 --> 04:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
here it's all factual it's a complete
 
04:55:20.150 --> 04:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
breakdown of seven towns and it's a
 
04:55:24.030 --> 04:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
complete breakdown of election law from
 
04:55:27.270 --> 04:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
Seven towns so please feel free to reach

information I'd be glad to provide it I
 
04:55:33.548 --> 04:55:33.558 align:start position:0%
support this bill and I think that we
 
04:55:35.230 --> 04:55:35.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely have to have them thank you
 
04:55:36.910 --> 04:55:36.920 align:start position:0%

the committee um ladies and gentlemen um
 
04:56:03.990 --> 04:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
today I stand before you to advocate for
 
04:56:05.670 --> 04:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
the necessity of stringent
 
04:56:07.708 --> 04:56:07.718 align:start position:0%
accountability measures for election
 
04:56:11.070 --> 04:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
officials who violate election laws the
 
04:56:12.830 --> 04:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
Integrity of our electoral process is
 
04:56:14.868 --> 04:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
the Bedrock of our constitutional
 
04:56:17.190 --> 04:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
republic ensuring that every Citizen's
 
04:56:20.430 --> 04:56:20.440 align:start position:0%
voice is heard and ballots counted
 
04:56:22.390 --> 04:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
accurately however this foundational
 
04:56:25.190 --> 04:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
principle is at risk for those entrusted
 
04:56:28.390 --> 04:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
to uphold it and they are not held to
 
04:56:32.110 --> 04:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
the higher standards of conduct and
 
04:56:33.830 --> 04:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility the the proposed
 
04:56:37.110 --> 04:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to RSA 634 specifically
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
subsection J is a critical step in
 
04:56:41.548 --> 04:56:41.558 align:start position:0%
reinforcing the sanctity of our
 
04:56:44.110 --> 04:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
elections IT addresses a gap in our
 
04:56:46.430 --> 04:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
current legislation by explicitly
 
04:56:48.150 --> 04:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
holding election officials accountable
 
04:56:50.990 --> 04:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
for any breach of election laws this
 
04:56:53.230 --> 04:56:53.240 align:start position:0%
provision is not merely punitive but it
 
04:56:56.030 --> 04:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
serves as a deterrent against potential
 
04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
misconduct and it ensures a fair
 
04:57:02.190 --> 04:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
transparent and trustworthy electoral
 
04:57:04.430 --> 04:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
process election officials wield
 
04:57:05.788 --> 04:57:05.798 align:start position:0%
significant influence over the
 
04:57:07.750 --> 04:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
administration of our elections from
 
04:57:09.590 --> 04:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
voter registration to Counting of
 
04:57:11.788 --> 04:57:11.798 align:start position:0%
ballots their actions can affect the
 
04:57:14.190 --> 04:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
outcome of Elections as we clearly saw
 
04:57:16.230 --> 04:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
in windham's 2020 general election and
 
04:57:19.548 --> 04:57:19.558 align:start position:0%
yet again in windham's 2022 primary
 
04:57:21.990 --> 04:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
election deteriorating the very fabric
 
04:57:24.670 --> 04:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
of our constitutional republic I brought
 
04:57:27.830 --> 04:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
for with me today I'm probably failed to
 
04:57:30.670 --> 04:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
mention I'm a resident of Windham and
 
04:57:32.910 --> 04:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
know we played a significant role in the
 
04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
h B I'm sorry the S sp43 forensic audit
 
04:57:39.070 --> 04:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
bill that passed unanimously and what I
 
04:57:40.830 --> 04:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
brought with me here today for your
 
04:57:42.670 --> 04:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
review and I hope that each and every
 
04:57:44.910 --> 04:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
one of you take the time to review
 
04:57:47.150 --> 04:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
review both of these documents these are
 
04:57:49.150 --> 04:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
both joint Letters From The Joint
 
04:57:50.590 --> 04:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office and the
 
04:57:53.310 --> 04:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office in 2020
 
04:57:55.590 --> 04:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
outlining over 130 violations of
 
04:57:55.600 --> 04:57:57.030 align:start position:0%
outlining over 130 violations of
election

04:57:57.030 --> 04:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:57:59.670 --> 04:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
law subsequent to the next federal
 
04:58:03.230 --> 04:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
election we had yet another 33
 
04:58:05.430 --> 04:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
violations of election law and by the
 
04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
way that was under the watchful eye of a
 
04:58:11.270 --> 04:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
appointed monitor pursuant to RSA
 
04:58:14.190 --> 04:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
677 and just recently two weeks ago
 
04:58:14.200 --> 04:58:15.190 align:start position:0%
677 and just recently two weeks ago

04:58:15.190 --> 04:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
Aaron
 
04:58:17.590 --> 04:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
Hennessy had the benefit of seeing
 
04:58:20.390 --> 04:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
firsthand the incompetence of our
 
04:58:23.270 --> 04:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
election monitor Peter moderator excuse
 
04:58:26.190 --> 04:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
me our election moderator Peter Griffin
 
04:58:27.948 --> 04:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
and our assistant moderators both Betty
 
04:58:31.230 --> 04:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
Dunn and gayen Sterns we went till 1:30
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
in the morning County 4,700 ballots and
 
04:58:36.948 --> 04:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
approximately 900 in the devcraft
 
04:58:39.430 --> 04:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
primary completely
 
04:58:41.628 --> 04:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
unacceptable the tapes were printed all
 
04:58:43.670 --> 04:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballots were processed all
 
04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
the hand count writings were done by
 
04:58:47.670 --> 04:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
9:24 we didn't finish till 1:30 in the
 
04:58:49.910 --> 04:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
morning and yet
 
04:58:52.510 --> 04:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
again inaccurate
 
04:58:56.150 --> 04:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
results were gone ahead and published 15
 
04:58:57.590 --> 04:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
minutes later they had to go ahead and
 
04:58:57.600 --> 04:59:02.030 align:start position:0%
minutes later they had to go ahead and
correct

04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:02.040 --> 04:59:04.230 align:start position:0%
 
those

04:59:04.230 --> 04:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:59:05.750 --> 04:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
so when these individuals violate

of justice enclosure it affirms that no
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
one is above the law not even those who

you okay uh will you taking questions
 
05:01:27.350 --> 05:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
from the committee absolutely all right
 
05:01:28.190 --> 05:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:01:31.110 --> 05:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative Lane thank you um and
 
05:01:33.548 --> 05:01:33.558 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question the report
 
05:01:36.070 --> 05:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
that you indicated that had a lot of and
 
05:01:38.430 --> 05:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
I forgot the number that you indicated
 
05:01:40.590 --> 05:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
had a lot of different violations
 
05:01:42.788 --> 05:01:42.798 align:start position:0%
recently is that something that you're
 
05:01:46.830 --> 05:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
submitting to us as okay yes ma'am and
 
05:01:50.190 --> 05:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah and how many of those
 
05:01:53.070 --> 05:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
violations would you call what and I'm
 
05:01:55.150 --> 05:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm a lawyer but would you call
 
05:01:57.910 --> 05:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
material or substantive and I think it
 
05:02:00.910 --> 05:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
gets to representative weary's question
 
05:02:03.270 --> 05:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
which is are these
 
05:02:07.110 --> 05:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
any violations like the the cone is not
 
05:02:10.190 --> 05:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
set up properly or they don't have the
 
05:02:13.110 --> 05:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
right distance for people to stand or
 
05:02:15.030 --> 05:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
are we talking
 
05:02:18.390 --> 05:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
active Mis beasant or mouth beasant
 
05:02:19.590 --> 05:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question that's a
 
05:02:22.708 --> 05:02:22.718 align:start position:0%
great question um if I could just let me
 
05:02:25.310 --> 05:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
cite just a couple things from this
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
joint letter from the Secretary of State
 
05:02:29.030 --> 05:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general windham's
 
05:02:30.590 --> 05:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
election nights results were not just
 
05:02:34.350 --> 05:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
and precise they were fundamentally
 
05:02:34.360 --> 05:02:37.310 align:start position:0%
and precise they were fundamentally
flawed

05:02:37.310 --> 05:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
flawed
 
05:02:40.510 --> 05:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
quote other errors such as only six test
 
05:02:43.230 --> 05:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
ballots instead of 50 ignored legal
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
obligations and are of continuing
 
05:02:47.230 --> 05:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
concern as they are indicative of an
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
election that was not executed to the
 
05:02:51.670 --> 05:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
standard of law or the expectation of
 
05:02:55.470 --> 05:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
Voters this goes on to outline over 130
 
05:02:57.750 --> 05:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
violations some more significant than
 
05:03:00.270 --> 05:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
others nevertheless we had the largest
 
05:03:02.350 --> 05:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
numerical discrepancy in state voting
 
05:03:03.708 --> 05:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
history here in
 
05:03:06.830 --> 05:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
Windham and it wasn't corrected it
 
05:03:11.070 --> 05:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:14.390 --> 05:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
day representative Hamlet thank you Mr
 
05:03:15.750 --> 05:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:03:17.948 --> 05:03:17.958 align:start position:0%
question were were
 
05:03:20.670 --> 05:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
these violations from the most recent
 
05:03:23.788 --> 05:03:23.798 align:start position:0%
election to January 23rd the January
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
23rd the uh report hasn't been issued
 
05:03:28.190 --> 05:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
yet by uh uh deputy secretary of state
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
Aaron Hennessy so um I can tell you that
 
05:03:33.548 --> 05:03:33.558 align:start position:0%
there were concerns whether there was
 
05:03:36.270 --> 05:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
violations I've yet to get any of the uh
 
05:03:37.868 --> 05:03:37.878 align:start position:0%
moderator's worksheets the moderator
 
05:03:41.628 --> 05:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
certificate the vote tallies the um the
 
05:03:44.310 --> 05:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
um the checklist I have I have yet to do
 
05:03:46.430 --> 05:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
that and I I don't believe the Secretary
 
05:03:48.470 --> 05:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
of State's office has weighed in on that
 
05:03:52.110 --> 05:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
as of yet but 2022 this just came out on
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
January 4th 2024 followup followup so so
 
05:04:00.030 --> 05:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
these violations were from which
 
05:04:02.190 --> 05:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
election the two I reference here in
 
05:04:04.150 --> 05:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
these letters this was this first letter
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
is dated January 7th of 2022 this
 
05:04:09.590 --> 05:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
represents the general election of 2020
 
05:04:12.150 --> 05:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
this letter here is dated January 4th of
 
05:04:15.470 --> 05:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
2024 this represents the September 13th
 
05:04:19.030 --> 05:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
Primary in 2022 okay thank
 
05:04:21.350 --> 05:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:04:25.390 --> 05:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
wearing uh so in our discussion with the
 
05:04:27.548 --> 05:04:27.558 align:start position:0%
previous speaker we talked about
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
changing the violates any election law
 
05:04:34.030 --> 05:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
to facilitates wrong
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh voting or Andor voter fraud does that
 
05:04:41.628 --> 05:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
narrow the scope too much for the
 
05:04:45.590 --> 05:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
concerns that you've presented in your
 
05:04:48.750 --> 05:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
letters I'm not objective to narrowing a
 
05:04:52.270 --> 05:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
scope however it would have to be
 
05:04:55.230 --> 05:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
narrowed with a point of accountability
 
05:04:58.788 --> 05:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
that prevents election officials from
 
05:05:01.030 --> 05:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
continuing to operate in the manner in
 
05:05:04.430 --> 05:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
which they're doing so just so the
 
05:05:05.788 --> 05:05:05.798 align:start position:0%
committee is
 
05:05:09.350 --> 05:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
clear these violations we had a very
 
05:05:13.510 --> 05:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
significant audit $770,000 was spent by
 
05:05:17.788 --> 05:05:17.798 align:start position:0%
the state that detailed this you would
 
05:05:20.470 --> 05:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
think that it would be reasonable to
 
05:05:23.910 --> 05:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
expect that these violations weren't
 
05:05:25.310 --> 05:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
made yet
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
again I heard you mention Mr chair folds
 
05:05:32.150 --> 05:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
and ballots believe it or not in 2022
 
05:05:34.948 --> 05:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
that was is one of the 33 violations
 
05:05:37.590 --> 05:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
that they actually committed again and
 
05:05:41.310 --> 05:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
what happens was these reports come from
 
05:05:42.708 --> 05:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and the Secretary
 
05:05:46.310 --> 05:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
of State's office however they do not
 
05:05:47.548 --> 05:05:47.558 align:start position:0%
have any
 
05:05:50.310 --> 05:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
means that the legislature has given
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
them to go ahead and hold these
 
05:05:54.990 --> 05:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
individuals accountable so yet here we
 
05:05:58.070 --> 05:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
are today and we just had another
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
election with the same individuals
 
05:06:03.390 --> 05:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for this malfeasance
 
05:06:05.470 --> 05:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
continuing to go ahead and conduct
 
05:06:08.150 --> 05:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
elections and not doing it pursuant to
 
05:06:08.160 --> 05:06:10.430 align:start position:0%
elections and not doing it pursuant to
the

05:06:10.430 --> 05:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:12.390 --> 05:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
law okay all right I'm going to help
 
05:06:13.868 --> 05:06:13.878 align:start position:0%
here a little bit um because we've asked
 
05:06:15.670 --> 05:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
the same question three different ways
 
05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
all right so the section that it's going
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
in establishes a $5,000 fine to the
 
05:06:22.270 --> 05:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
person what the sponsor is doing is they
 
05:06:24.230 --> 05:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
are adding a clause to the very end of
 
05:06:25.990 --> 05:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
the list of things that are referenced
 
05:06:27.830 --> 05:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
saying if the person is an election
 
05:06:29.750 --> 05:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
officer and they violate any election
 
05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
law so the reason you're seeing the
 
05:06:32.990 --> 05:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
stuff there above there about
 
05:06:34.548 --> 05:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
registering to vote is cuz that's what
 
05:06:36.510 --> 05:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
the title is and what they're doing is
 
05:06:38.350 --> 05:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
they're moving that Ora statement from
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
section 8 to section I and then adding a
 
05:06:44.990 --> 05:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
j station so to kind of clear things up
 
05:06:48.030 --> 05:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
it's targeted at election officers who
 
05:06:50.310 --> 05:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
violate the election law and it's a fine
 
05:06:52.270 --> 05:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
up to $5,000 so that's what we're
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
talking about all right I hope that
 
05:06:56.070 --> 05:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
helped or didn't make it worse or who
 
05:06:57.270 --> 05:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
knows probably made it worse
 
05:07:00.750 --> 05:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you
 
05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering
 
05:07:07.948 --> 05:07:07.958 align:start position:0%
if you know if the election officer
 
05:07:09.670 --> 05:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
reference in this
 
05:07:09.680 --> 05:07:12.910 align:start position:0%
reference in this
bill

05:07:12.910 --> 05:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:18.110 --> 05:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
is an elected election officer or is it
 
05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
a volunteer or Does it include every
 
05:07:24.190 --> 05:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
single person that works at an election
 
05:07:27.788 --> 05:07:27.798 align:start position:0%
because our elections are largely run by
 
05:07:31.708 --> 05:07:31.718 align:start position:0%
volunteers and I have some concerns
 
05:07:34.270 --> 05:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
because they are sworn in as election
 
05:07:38.590 --> 05:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
officers on Election Day that this would
 
05:07:41.628 --> 05:07:41.638 align:start position:0%
be targeting volunteers and lead
 
05:07:45.868 --> 05:07:45.878 align:start position:0%
to fewer volunteers and less efficient
 
05:07:47.948 --> 05:07:47.958 align:start position:0%
elections uh because we would not be
 
05:07:51.270 --> 05:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
able to recruit people who might worry
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
that they are going to be fined $5,000
 
05:07:57.350 --> 05:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if you if you
 
05:07:59.350 --> 05:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
understand it like that is it just
 
05:08:02.590 --> 05:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
electeds or volunteers or all of the
 
05:08:04.868 --> 05:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
above yeah thank you for that question
 
05:08:06.670 --> 05:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
I'm acutely aware of that and that
 
05:08:08.948 --> 05:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
actually has crossed my mind and given
 
05:08:11.868 --> 05:08:11.878 align:start position:0%
me pause
 
05:08:15.270 --> 05:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
however it doesn't solve the problem
 
05:08:17.628 --> 05:08:17.638 align:start position:0%
without the teeth and the
 
05:08:20.590 --> 05:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
bill it's not just our moderator it's
 
05:08:22.830 --> 05:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
our town clerk it's our
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
selectman it's also volunteers people
 
05:08:27.190 --> 05:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
that volunteer and get sworn in as
 
05:08:29.788 --> 05:08:29.798 align:start position:0%
assistant moderators those individuals
 
05:08:33.110 --> 05:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
are actually culpable in guilty for
 
05:08:33.120 --> 05:08:34.150 align:start position:0%
are actually culpable in guilty for
these

05:08:34.150 --> 05:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
violations the problem is is how do
 
05:08:43.390 --> 05:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
I get redress of my grievance because I
 
05:08:45.788 --> 05:08:45.798 align:start position:0%
haven't had a free and fair election in
 
05:08:48.310 --> 05:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
four elections three Federal
 
05:08:51.270 --> 05:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
elections and the only thing I feel is I
 
05:08:53.590 --> 05:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
I can do at this point in time is to
 
05:08:53.600 --> 05:08:54.910 align:start position:0%
I can do at this point in time is to
file

05:08:54.910 --> 05:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
file
 
05:08:58.310 --> 05:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
litigation which as a residents of wind
 
05:09:01.390 --> 05:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
him I shouldn't be forced to do that
 
05:09:03.150 --> 05:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
because of the competence of these
 
05:09:03.160 --> 05:09:04.110 align:start position:0%
because of the competence of these
election

05:09:04.110 --> 05:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
election
 
05:09:07.830 --> 05:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
officials who fly in the face of the
 
05:09:10.548 --> 05:09:10.558 align:start position:0%
election law because they're not held to
 
05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
any accountability of it so they
 
05:09:16.070 --> 05:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
continue to this day to make the same
 
05:09:17.350 --> 05:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
mistakes over and over and I'm not
 
05:09:20.230 --> 05:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
saying they're doing it in a malicious
 
05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
way but nonetheless the malfeasance is
 
05:09:26.230 --> 05:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
occurring further questions
 
05:09:30.270 --> 05:09:30.280 align:start position:0%
representative P Brien thank you
 
05:09:33.310 --> 05:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
sir usually
 
05:09:36.868 --> 05:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
when okay usually when these things
 
05:09:39.628 --> 05:09:39.638 align:start position:0%
happen the redress of grievances would
 
05:09:42.230 --> 05:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
be other people are
 
05:09:46.350 --> 05:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
elected so what you bring up I think is
 
05:09:51.868 --> 05:09:51.878 align:start position:0%
really um singular in what we hear I we
 
05:09:54.470 --> 05:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't hear about other towns with these
 
05:09:57.470 --> 05:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
problems uh very often and to the level
 
05:10:00.510 --> 05:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
that you're discussing so since the
 
05:10:02.190 --> 05:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
first letter has come out where you say
 
05:10:06.310 --> 05:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's 100 or more uh 130 I think I
 
05:10:08.590 --> 05:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
remember I I read that one uh when it
 
05:10:11.750 --> 05:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
came out has there been an election and
 
05:10:13.948 --> 05:10:13.958 align:start position:0%
have new people been elected or are they
 
05:10:16.110 --> 05:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
the same people that's a great question
 
05:10:18.230 --> 05:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
in fact I actually volunteered myself to
 
05:10:20.670 --> 05:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
run for moderator I was unsuccessful in
 
05:10:23.430 --> 05:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
my bid to do so and that's unfortunate
 
05:10:26.430 --> 05:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
and they continue but nonetheless that
 
05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't address the violations
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
of part one article 11 and and part two
 
05:10:34.910 --> 05:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
article 32 in my constitutional
 
05:10:36.750 --> 05:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
guaranteed rights to a free and fair
 
05:10:39.150 --> 05:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
election that's still being violated to
 
05:10:39.160 --> 05:10:39.990 align:start position:0%
election that's still being violated to
this

05:10:39.990 --> 05:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:10:44.430 --> 05:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
day so I understand the question is the
 
05:10:46.830 --> 05:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
remedy at The Ballot Box I would submit
 
05:10:49.270 --> 05:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
to you that this letter dated January
 
05:10:53.350 --> 05:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
4th 2024 speaks to the opposite that it
 
05:10:55.548 --> 05:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
continues and I shouldn't have to run
 
05:10:58.548 --> 05:10:58.558 align:start position:0%
for office to guarantee those rights
 
05:11:00.190 --> 05:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
that are afforded to
 
05:11:03.310 --> 05:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
me further questions from the
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee oh oh wow okay representative
 
05:11:07.590 --> 05:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
wood thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:11:09.548 --> 05:11:09.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you aware of
 
05:11:11.708 --> 05:11:11.718 align:start position:0%
other towns with similar
 
05:11:14.788 --> 05:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
problems um could you be more specific
 
05:11:16.430 --> 05:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
well it seems like uh there was a
 
05:11:18.628 --> 05:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
question asked that winam seems to have
 
05:11:21.948 --> 05:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
a particular problem are you aware of uh
 
05:11:24.270 --> 05:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
similar towns that would benefit from
 
05:11:27.070 --> 05:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
this type of uh legislation I am a well
 
05:11:30.830 --> 05:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
I am aware of other cities and towns in
 
05:11:33.150 --> 05:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
the state that that have similar
 
05:11:36.310 --> 05:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
violations of election law that are
 
05:11:39.628 --> 05:11:39.638 align:start position:0%
detailed in the Windom joint complaints
 
05:11:43.788 --> 05:11:43.798 align:start position:0%
yes sir I am did I follow up follow up
 
05:11:45.990 --> 05:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
do they have similar uh backing of
 
05:11:48.030 --> 05:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
information like you have there
 
05:11:51.150 --> 05:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
specifics it sound sounds to me I
 
05:11:52.830 --> 05:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
haven't seen you let me just finish the
 
05:11:54.230 --> 05:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
so you know what I'm trying to ask you
 
05:11:57.150 --> 05:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
sorry uh sorry for interrupting you uh I
 
05:11:58.670 --> 05:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
haven't seen those the paperwork you
 
05:11:59.990 --> 05:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
have there but it sounds like there's
 
05:12:02.510 --> 05:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
spec very specific evidence
 
05:12:05.350 --> 05:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
what I would call evidence 130 okay are
 
05:12:07.750 --> 05:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
youare are you aware of other towns
 
05:12:10.390 --> 05:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
having similar type of evidence I am I
 
05:12:12.310 --> 05:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
am aware that there are some cities and
 
05:12:14.310 --> 05:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
towns that have similar violations of
 
05:12:16.670 --> 05:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
election law that are detailed in both
 
05:12:18.868 --> 05:12:18.878 align:start position:0%
letters from the Secretary of State and
 
05:12:20.910 --> 05:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office I am okay
 
05:12:23.350 --> 05:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome further
 
05:12:25.510 --> 05:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative Prim O'Brien
 
05:12:25.520 --> 05:12:26.270 align:start position:0%
questions representative Prim O'Brien
thank

05:12:26.270 --> 05:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:12:29.270 --> 05:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
you to get to what representative wood
 
05:12:31.150 --> 05:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
was asking are you familiar with them
 
05:12:33.590 --> 05:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
being a of the same amount the same
 
05:12:35.948 --> 05:12:35.958 align:start position:0%
number I I remember in my community we
 
05:12:38.270 --> 05:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
had something it was like five or six
 
05:12:40.990 --> 05:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
violations and I was stunned about that
 
05:12:44.110 --> 05:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
back then but now it's just a whole new
 
05:12:45.788 --> 05:12:45.798 align:start position:0%
ball game to me that's what it seems
 
05:12:47.190 --> 05:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
like are you familiar with any Town
 
05:12:48.628 --> 05:12:48.638 align:start position:0%
coming close to those numbers you're
 
05:12:50.510 --> 05:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
talking about in Windham
 
05:12:53.150 --> 05:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
marac okay um marac was probably one of
 
05:12:56.548 --> 05:12:56.558 align:start position:0%
the most egregious in the 2020 election
 
05:12:58.350 --> 05:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
um when we talked about F that's in
 
05:13:02.470 --> 05:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
ballots Windam was around 99.6%
 
05:13:04.310 --> 05:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
marac was over
 
05:13:07.230 --> 05:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
22% so you had a significant effect
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
however it's important to note that
 
05:13:12.150 --> 05:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
house bill 1163 remedied part of the fix
 
05:13:16.750 --> 05:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
for that um however the U what's been
 
05:13:19.310 --> 05:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
coined the Phantom vote that's still um
 
05:13:20.750 --> 05:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
an issue to this
 
05:13:22.548 --> 05:13:22.558 align:start position:0%
day okay so here's what we're going to
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
do uh we're going to pause this we're
 
05:13:28.110 --> 05:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
going to recess this uh house bill 14 um
 
05:13:29.310 --> 05:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:13:32.590 --> 05:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
1442 um because we are over time and the
 
05:13:34.708 --> 05:13:34.718 align:start position:0%
sponsor of House Bill
 
05:13:38.548 --> 05:13:38.558 align:start position:0%
1596 oh actually hold on that's you I
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
I'm more represent
 
05:13:43.708 --> 05:13:43.718 align:start position:0%
McGuire are you currently in a committee
 
05:13:44.910 --> 05:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
no okay all right never mind we're gonna
 
05:13:44.920 --> 05:13:46.628 align:start position:0%
no okay all right never mind we're gonna
keep

05:13:46.628 --> 05:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
keep
 
05:13:49.868 --> 05:13:49.878 align:start position:0%
going you thank you so much uh and thank
 
05:13:53.430 --> 05:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh so th this
 
05:13:56.270 --> 05:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
this bill uh places the penalty uh
 
05:13:59.948 --> 05:13:59.958 align:start position:0%
section J in RSA
 
05:14:03.750 --> 05:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
65934 uh which States uh at the top of
 
05:14:06.350 --> 05:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh section one a person is subject to
 
05:14:09.150 --> 05:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
civil penalty a a civil penalty not to
 
05:14:09.160 --> 05:14:10.190 align:start position:0%
civil penalty a a civil penalty not to
exceed

05:14:10.190 --> 05:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
exceed
 
05:14:13.830 --> 05:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
$5,000 if such person and then it would
 
05:14:16.990 --> 05:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
suggest part J uh is there anything
 
05:14:20.470 --> 05:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
preventing somebody uh from serving as
 
05:14:21.990 --> 05:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
an election official again because this
 
05:14:24.190 --> 05:14:24.200 align:start position:0%
is only listed under the Civil penalty
 
05:14:25.270 --> 05:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
statute I'm sorry can you rephrase the
 
05:14:30.350 --> 05:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
last part of your question uh
 
05:14:33.830 --> 05:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
so essent ially uh because part J is
 
05:14:38.310 --> 05:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
being placed under part one of RSA
 
05:14:40.990 --> 05:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
65934 which states a person is subject
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
to a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000
 
05:14:47.750 --> 05:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
if such person would uh be subject to
 
05:14:50.310 --> 05:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
performing as an election officer in any
 
05:14:53.390 --> 05:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
election and violates any election law
 
05:14:57.030 --> 05:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
that is uh that's from my interpretation
 
05:14:59.548 --> 05:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
states that they would be subject to the
 
05:15:02.230 --> 05:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
$5,000 up to a $5,000 Cil penalty is
 
05:15:04.230 --> 05:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
there anything preventing an election
 
05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
officer uh from serving again if this is
 
05:15:07.708 --> 05:15:07.718 align:start position:0%
only a civil
 
05:15:10.670 --> 05:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
penalty I don't think it prevents um
 
05:15:12.708 --> 05:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
someone from serving again however I
 
05:15:15.150 --> 05:15:15.160 align:start position:0%
think it deters someone from serving if
 
05:15:16.350 --> 05:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to continue to make
 
05:15:19.670 --> 05:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
violations as is the case in the town of
 
05:15:22.510 --> 05:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
wiim that perhaps um significant
 
05:15:24.788 --> 05:15:24.798 align:start position:0%
penalties were levied on these
 
05:15:27.430 --> 05:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
individuals after clear findings were
 
05:15:29.270 --> 05:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
made and it's important to note too to
 
05:15:31.110 --> 05:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
the committee these are official
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
findings by the Attorney General's
 
05:15:36.590 --> 05:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
office they're not just my opinion so um
 
05:15:38.350 --> 05:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I would hope that it would in in
 
05:15:41.070 --> 05:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
fact I think it's really notable to
 
05:15:43.190 --> 05:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
mention that one of the individuals
 
05:15:45.750 --> 05:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's actually responsible for many of
 
05:15:48.190 --> 05:15:48.200 align:start position:0%
these violations happens to be running
 
05:15:51.150 --> 05:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
for moderator this election
 
05:15:53.030 --> 05:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
cycle okay thank you we're going to let
 
05:15:56.190 --> 05:15:56.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Murray go um uh where should I give
 
05:15:59.230 --> 05:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
you test give that to representative
 
05:16:12.628 --> 05:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:15.510 --> 05:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
Dan hilly city clerk NASA um
 
05:16:17.150 --> 05:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire City and town
 
05:16:17.160 --> 05:16:18.310 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire City and town
clerk's

05:16:18.310 --> 05:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
clerk's
 
05:16:20.868 --> 05:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
Association So based off of what the
 
05:16:22.390 --> 05:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
previous speaker said I just want to
 
05:16:25.190 --> 05:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
provide some clarification on this bill
 
05:16:29.788 --> 05:16:29.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is uh dealing with election
 
05:16:32.910 --> 05:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
officers so there was a Bill last year
 
05:16:34.628 --> 05:16:34.638 align:start position:0%
that passed that deals with election
 
05:16:36.750 --> 05:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
officials so the election officials are
 
05:16:38.948 --> 05:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
the elected members the clerk the
 
05:16:40.948 --> 05:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
moderator the
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
Selectmen there is already a bill that
 
05:16:46.948 --> 05:16:46.958 align:start position:0%
establishes penalties if they violate
 
05:16:49.350 --> 05:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
any election laws and there should be a
 
05:16:53.230 --> 05:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
bill for that we are the ones that are
 
05:16:56.628 --> 05:16:56.638 align:start position:0%
dealing with this uh daily basis we know
 
05:16:58.590 --> 05:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
the procedure manual we know the
 
05:17:02.030 --> 05:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
election laws we train these people
 
05:17:04.390 --> 05:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
for you know maybe it's a three-hour
 
05:17:06.990 --> 05:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
session the week prior a few weeks prior
 
05:17:08.590 --> 05:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
to the election the state provides
 
05:17:11.150 --> 05:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
election training for anyone that wants
 
05:17:13.628 --> 05:17:13.638 align:start position:0%
uh to go but these people are doing it
 
05:17:16.350 --> 05:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
on a limited basis and I think to have
 
05:17:18.430 --> 05:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
them have a you know a pretty
 
05:17:18.440 --> 05:17:19.948 align:start position:0%
them have a you know a pretty
significant

05:17:19.948 --> 05:17:19.958 align:start position:0%
significant
 
05:17:23.830 --> 05:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
violation um if they make a mistake I
 
05:17:26.390 --> 05:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
mean that's a pretty big deal there was
 
05:17:29.868 --> 05:17:29.878 align:start position:0%
talk about putting the word knowingly in
 
05:17:32.510 --> 05:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
and I think we'd be amendable to that so
 
05:17:34.350 --> 05:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
performs as an election officer in any
 
05:17:36.390 --> 05:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
election and know only violates any
 
05:17:39.510 --> 05:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
election law you know if someone is
 
05:17:42.750 --> 05:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
blatantly uh they they their goal is to
 
05:17:47.390 --> 05:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
become an election um officer and to get
 
05:17:49.270 --> 05:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
up you know day of the election and
 
05:17:51.070 --> 05:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
violate all these election laws and
 
05:17:53.510 --> 05:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing it you know on purpose
 
05:17:55.670 --> 05:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's there's a difference there but if
 
05:17:57.548 --> 05:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
you put that word knowingly I think you
 
05:17:59.750 --> 05:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
know we could get behind that if they're
 
05:18:01.868 --> 05:18:01.878 align:start position:0%
knowingly violating
 
05:18:06.628 --> 05:18:06.638 align:start position:0%
um known laws um but I don't think that
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
the uh volunteer in some cases their
 
05:18:11.310 --> 05:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
volunteers that signs up to work that
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
day should be faced with the same
 
05:18:17.470 --> 05:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
penalties that our election officials
 
05:18:21.030 --> 05:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
that are you know trained and signed up
 
05:18:23.230 --> 05:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
and um or elected to these positions
 
05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
should be facing and I'd like to add as
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
president of the uh Clerk's Association
 
05:18:30.708 --> 05:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
some of these issues that happened in
 
05:18:32.350 --> 05:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
Windam from from 2020 they've been
 
05:18:35.350 --> 05:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
addressed with s SP uh uh
 
05:18:39.830 --> 05:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
43 um you're going back a few years now
 
05:18:42.230 --> 05:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh the Windom officials aren't here to
 
05:18:44.788 --> 05:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
defend themselves on those statements
 
05:18:46.390 --> 05:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
but I think at this time it's kind of
 
05:18:48.948 --> 05:18:48.958 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to be going back that many
 
05:18:51.310 --> 05:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
years with that many accusations against
 
05:18:54.868 --> 05:18:54.878 align:start position:0%
those officials uh without them here to
 
05:18:57.390 --> 05:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
defend themselves and this bill doesn't
 
05:19:00.030 --> 05:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
talk about uh election officials it's
 
05:19:02.310 --> 05:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
election officers
 
05:19:04.190 --> 05:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
so I'd be open to any
 
05:19:05.990 --> 05:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the committee
 
05:19:09.750 --> 05:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you am I
 
05:19:11.990 --> 05:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
correct in understanding your testimony
 
05:19:14.628 --> 05:19:14.638 align:start position:0%
that your interpretation of this bill
 
05:19:16.990 --> 05:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
where it refers to election officer
 
05:19:20.868 --> 05:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
would include volunteers and not
 
05:19:25.788 --> 05:19:25.798 align:start position:0%
just elected election officials I
 
05:19:28.670 --> 05:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
believe that's what this bill um is
 
05:19:32.270 --> 05:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
doing it's now adding the the volunteers
 
05:19:33.910 --> 05:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
the people that just sign up for that
 
05:19:36.470 --> 05:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
day their previous bill regarding
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
election officials um covers you know
 
05:19:42.190 --> 05:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
the moderators clerks but this bill I
 
05:19:45.708 --> 05:19:45.718 align:start position:0%
think specifically is tying in those
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
people that just are you know the
 
05:19:50.868 --> 05:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
onetime workers of that day thank you
 
05:19:52.030 --> 05:19:52.040 align:start position:0%

05:20:26.830 --> 05:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
scandin um really because in

2022 he took a really major major
 
05:20:33.350 --> 05:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
challenge Challenge and voted confidence
 
05:20:35.230 --> 05:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
voted confidence was falling off the
 
05:20:38.110 --> 05:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
cliff and I'm sure against a lot of
 
05:20:40.548 --> 05:20:40.558 align:start position:0%
political pressure he was able to stand
 
05:20:43.270 --> 05:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
up and gave the citizens a place to be
 
05:20:45.750 --> 05:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
heard it was around the state when all
 
05:20:48.430 --> 05:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
around the state I was part of that and
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
testified there and one of the biggest
 
05:20:52.948 --> 05:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
things that Secretary State when he
 
05:20:55.150 --> 05:20:55.160 align:start position:0%
comes and he speaks is always about
 
05:20:56.670 --> 05:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
we're here for voter
 
05:21:00.030 --> 05:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
confidence um and I want it it's hard
 
05:21:00.040 --> 05:21:01.830 align:start position:0%
confidence um and I want it it's hard
for

05:21:01.830 --> 05:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:21:03.470 --> 05:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
I'm one of the volunteers that's been
 
05:21:05.948 --> 05:21:05.958 align:start position:0%
part of a lot of these audits not just
 
05:21:08.190 --> 05:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
me but there's hundreds of people like
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
me that have put in thousands of hours
 
05:21:13.910 --> 05:21:13.920 align:start position:0%

been Vol volunteering to do that so I
 
05:21:23.590 --> 05:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
want to point out something here in the
 
05:21:27.030 --> 05:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
election procedure manual you realize
 
05:21:29.150 --> 05:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
that to hold anybody accountable this

whole manual 90% of this is
 
05:21:35.270 --> 05:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
procedures it's not accountable by law
 
05:21:38.030 --> 05:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
only a very small percentage about 10%
 
05:21:40.948 --> 05:21:40.958 align:start position:0%
that's regulated through the RSA gives
 
05:21:44.470 --> 05:21:44.480 align:start position:0%

4 the election procedure manual was a
 
05:21:55.110 --> 05:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
resource and learning learning tool the
 
05:21:56.708 --> 05:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
manual was not a substitute for the
 
05:21:59.590 --> 05:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
relevant statutes or legal advice Court
 
05:22:02.270 --> 05:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
decisions in and changes to the statutes
 
05:22:04.390 --> 05:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
made between printings and the manual
 
05:22:06.548 --> 05:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
may change election law whenever
 
05:22:09.310 --> 05:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
uncertainty exists as to the what action
 
05:22:12.030 --> 05:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
to take we will make our best effort to

people who do the work there is no
 
05:22:26.590 --> 05:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
there's no violation for
 
05:22:28.948 --> 05:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
them we want to hold the people that
 
05:22:30.708 --> 05:22:30.718 align:start position:0%

the machines the data the data cards and
 
05:22:47.708 --> 05:22:47.718 align:start position:0%
the activity logs that record by a you
 
05:22:49.868 --> 05:22:49.878 align:start position:0%
know we signed two signatures and the
 
05:22:51.628 --> 05:22:51.638 align:start position:0%
maintenance person that's an affidavit
 
05:22:55.150 --> 05:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
we found that a bunch of them 40% were
 
05:22:57.990 --> 05:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
not accurate or not signed we went to
 
05:23:00.590 --> 05:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice myself and and
 
05:23:00.600 --> 05:23:01.910 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice myself and and

05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
Tracy who is ultimately responsible
 
05:23:17.230 --> 05:23:17.240 align:start position:0%
party for the purchase maintenance
 
05:23:20.230 --> 05:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
programming security chain of custody
 
05:23:22.910 --> 05:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
and operational use of voting machines
 
05:23:26.510 --> 05:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
and elections Mr Madison responded the
 
05:23:29.070 --> 05:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
selectman Mr Bean asked again for a
 
05:23:32.230 --> 05:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
clarification Mr Madison again the
 
05:23:34.830 --> 05:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
selectman so I'm trying to we're all
 
05:23:37.350 --> 05:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
trying to find out everyone is doing
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
this we losing Confidence from the
 
05:23:42.788 --> 05:23:42.798 align:start position:0%
regular people who show up and do the
 
05:23:51.830 --> 05:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:55.030 --> 05:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
accountability just a second
 
05:23:55.040 --> 05:23:56.708 align:start position:0%
accountability just a second
here

05:23:56.708 --> 05:23:56.718 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:23:59.830 --> 05:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
yeah um Senate District 24 I was part of
 
05:24:01.628 --> 05:24:01.638 align:start position:0%
the recount
 
05:24:05.548 --> 05:24:05.558 align:start position:0%
uh it was lug guard jula's race
 
05:24:05.558 --> 05:24:07.190 align:start position:0%
uh it was lug guard jula's race
174

05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
174
 
05:24:10.270 --> 05:24:10.280 align:start position:0%
violations 174 they're here and they're
 
05:24:14.230 --> 05:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
as egregious as um chain of custody no
 
05:24:16.548 --> 05:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
chain of custody on the boxes in fact
 
05:24:17.910 --> 05:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear later on about
 
05:24:21.270 --> 05:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
boxes the boxes were a lot of them were
 
05:24:23.430 --> 05:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
were didn't have the proper tape on them
 
05:24:25.868 --> 05:24:25.878 align:start position:0%
or the tape was missing or they weren't
 
05:24:28.350 --> 05:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
documented all that's here these are not
 
05:24:30.390 --> 05:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
insignificant not you know having the
 
05:24:33.270 --> 05:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
line big enough and it was all went to
 
05:24:35.548 --> 05:24:35.558 align:start position:0%
the U ballot law commission and the
 
05:24:37.270 --> 05:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission recommended it to
 
05:24:38.628 --> 05:24:38.638 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice you know
 
05:24:42.350 --> 05:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
what's happened nothing
 
05:24:42.360 --> 05:24:43.990 align:start position:0%
what's happened nothing
nothing

05:24:43.990 --> 05:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
05:24:46.430 --> 05:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
so one of the questions that the ballot
 
05:24:49.350 --> 05:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
law commission asked was would the
 
05:24:51.910 --> 05:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
election have been affected due to these
 
05:24:51.920 --> 05:24:53.430 align:start position:0%
election have been affected due to these
many

05:24:53.430 --> 05:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
many
 
05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
violations the loyer for Lugar julo his
 
05:24:59.788 --> 05:24:59.798 align:start position:0%
name is uh attorney McDonald stated how
 
05:25:02.548 --> 05:25:02.558 align:start position:0%
can you say it would be with this many
 
05:25:04.548 --> 05:25:04.558 align:start position:0%
operational violations you can't attest
 
05:25:07.350 --> 05:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
to it nor can we this is the problem
 
05:25:09.990 --> 05:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
when we have procedural errors we have
 
05:25:12.788 --> 05:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
to look at them as they add up right and
 
05:25:14.430 --> 05:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
it takes away voter confidence that's
 
05:25:15.430 --> 05:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
what we're here
 
05:25:20.030 --> 05:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
for and last um for all of us um if you
 
05:25:21.830 --> 05:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't have anyone to hold accountable
 
05:25:25.948 --> 05:25:25.958 align:start position:0%
then we basically have have tyranny so

bill 2024 is the first election year
 
05:27:49.150 --> 05:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
where artificial intelligence seems to

be accessible at everyone's fingertips
 
05:27:55.150 --> 05:27:55.160 align:start position:0%

minutes using an iPhone app for Next
 
05:28:04.150 --> 05:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
nothing deceptive synthetic media
 
05:28:07.310 --> 05:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
manipulates images audio and video to
 
05:28:10.470 --> 05:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
trick the viewer or listener and depicts
 
05:28:12.990 --> 05:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
something that did not actually occur in
 
05:28:17.390 --> 05:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
real life in an age of rapidly advancing
 
05:28:20.110 --> 05:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
technology and an ever increasing rise
 
05:28:24.070 --> 05:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
in disinformation the 2024 election is a

perfect storm ripe for dirty tricks let
 
05:28:30.510 --> 05:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
me State emphatically the dissemination
 
05:28:33.548 --> 05:28:33.558 align:start position:0%
a of disinformation is detrimental to
 
05:28:36.230 --> 05:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
our democracy and we must do something
 
05:28:40.910 --> 05:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
about it hb1 1596 requires disclosure of
 
05:28:43.510 --> 05:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
deceptively manipulated media often

referred to as fraudulent deep fakes
 
05:28:49.110 --> 05:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
without disclosure the use of fraudulent
 
05:28:51.430 --> 05:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
deep fakes of a candidate or party would

election the limited scope time frame
 
05:28:59.430 --> 05:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
exists as one of several ways this bill
 
05:29:02.110 --> 05:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
bends over back to amarate any First
 
05:29:02.120 --> 05:29:03.310 align:start position:0%
bends over back to amarate any First
Amendment

05:29:03.310 --> 05:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:29:05.948 --> 05:29:05.958 align:start position:0%

audio greater than 2 minutes in
 
05:29:27.470 --> 05:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
length this bill allows a candidate to
 
05:29:29.510 --> 05:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
take action if they are depicted in an
 
05:29:32.230 --> 05:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
undisclosed deep fake the candidate May
 
05:29:34.270 --> 05:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
seek injunctive relief to stop the
 
05:29:36.788 --> 05:29:36.798 align:start position:0%
distribution of the deceptive deep fake
 
05:29:39.150 --> 05:29:39.160 align:start position:0%
as well as bring in action for damages
 
05:29:41.990 --> 05:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
against the sponsor there are a number
 
05:29:44.310 --> 05:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
of First Amendment safe harbors baked
 
05:29:46.548 --> 05:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
into this bill that provide exemptions
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
for news broadcasts Publications radio
 
05:29:52.150 --> 05:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
and TV stations that make a reasonable
 
05:29:54.830 --> 05:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
effort to prevent spreading deep fakes
 
05:29:56.868 --> 05:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
as well as an exemption for obvious
 
05:30:00.310 --> 05:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
satire or parody the aim of this bill is
 
05:30:01.948 --> 05:30:01.958 align:start position:0%
to hold the sponsor of the fraudulent
 
05:30:05.150 --> 05:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
deep fake accountable not good faith
 
05:30:08.788 --> 05:30:08.798 align:start position:0%
Distributors HB 1596 is necessary
 
05:30:11.230 --> 05:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Common Sense legislation that
 
05:30:13.270 --> 05:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
takes a step forward to deal with the
 
05:30:15.510 --> 05:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
reality of a rapidly advancing
 
05:30:17.948 --> 05:30:17.958 align:start position:0%
technology capable of disrupting our
 
05:30:20.708 --> 05:30:20.718 align:start position:0%
democracy and deceptively sowing
 
05:30:23.548 --> 05:30:23.558 align:start position:0%
distrust voters deserve better than
 
05:30:25.910 --> 05:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
deception and dirty tricks I hope
 
05:30:27.390 --> 05:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
Granite State voters can count on this
 
05:30:29.948 --> 05:30:29.958 align:start position:0%
committee to support HB 1596 with a
 
05:30:32.830 --> 05:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
strong OTP recommendation thank you and
 
05:30:34.350 --> 05:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions questions
 
05:30:35.910 --> 05:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:30:38.548 --> 05:30:38.558 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
05:30:41.270 --> 05:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
wey um so
 
05:30:47.230 --> 05:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
on uh the first page of the bill um on
 
05:30:49.788 --> 05:30:49.798 align:start position:0%
line 19 it's it talks about state and
 
05:30:51.990 --> 05:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
local ballot
 
05:30:54.990 --> 05:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
so are you just limiting that
 
05:31:00.830 --> 05:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
to to state and local candidates and and
 
05:31:05.868 --> 05:31:05.878 align:start position:0%
um or or would it apply to Federal uh
 
05:31:08.390 --> 05:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
advertisement as well that uses deep
 
05:31:13.670 --> 05:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:16.990 --> 05:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
fakes I the purpose of this bill is to
 
05:31:20.868 --> 05:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
stay within the scope of the state um I
 
05:31:22.990 --> 05:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
would not want to overstep the federal
 
05:31:25.230 --> 05:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
level um to the extent that it could be
 
05:31:27.150 --> 05:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
applied to the federal with a law in the
 
05:31:29.708 --> 05:31:29.718 align:start position:0%
state then I would like that to be done
 
05:31:34.430 --> 05:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
but there are federal um bills in the
 
05:31:37.150 --> 05:31:37.160 align:start position:0%
works to address this at the federal
 
05:31:39.750 --> 05:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
level and we may see them in the coming
 
05:31:42.548 --> 05:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
year but this is a step forward um for
 
05:31:45.110 --> 05:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
our state at the state
 
05:31:45.120 --> 05:31:46.868 align:start position:0%
our state at the state
level

05:31:46.868 --> 05:31:46.878 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:31:50.070 --> 05:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
followup and um likewise on the same
 
05:31:53.390 --> 05:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
page is there any reason for the 90 days
 
05:31:56.070 --> 05:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh prior to an election um I know that's
 
05:31:58.510 --> 05:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
probably a campaign cycle but is there
 
05:32:00.830 --> 05:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
any reason why
 
05:32:02.628 --> 05:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
you know we wouldn't anticipate that
 
05:32:06.270 --> 05:32:06.280 align:start position:0%
people would at you know day 100 to 90
 
05:32:09.470 --> 05:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
flood the market as it will were to
 
05:32:12.230 --> 05:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
using such things why why the 90 days
 
05:32:15.788 --> 05:32:15.798 align:start position:0%
and why not longer thank you um it is
 
05:32:18.430 --> 05:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
limited in scope U Limited in time frame
 
05:32:20.430 --> 05:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
to address First Amendment concerns
 
05:32:21.990 --> 05:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
there have previously been bills in
 
05:32:25.430 --> 05:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
other states that made it um a ban or
 
05:32:30.110 --> 05:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
prohibited it year round and that face
 
05:32:32.030 --> 05:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
those have faced challenges uh Court
 
05:32:34.390 --> 05:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
challenges First Amendment concerns so
 
05:32:36.868 --> 05:32:36.878 align:start position:0%
to keep it limited in scope IT addresses
 
05:32:38.510 --> 05:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
um First Amendment concerns and make
 
05:32:40.590 --> 05:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
sure that it's not violating those First
 
05:32:42.670 --> 05:32:42.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights further questions from
 
05:32:45.390 --> 05:32:45.400 align:start position:0%

question on uh page one uh line
 
05:32:57.190 --> 05:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
18 uh where talks about uses uses the
 
05:32:58.948 --> 05:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
phrase should have
 
05:33:03.230 --> 05:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
known uh that a a message was uh
 
05:33:05.270 --> 05:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
deceptive or fraudulent deep fake what's
 
05:33:07.030 --> 05:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
the standard of proof for
 
05:33:09.990 --> 05:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
some determining that someone should
 
05:33:10.000 --> 05:33:11.070 align:start position:0%
some determining that someone should
have

05:33:11.070 --> 05:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:33:13.948 --> 05:33:13.958 align:start position:0%
known uh especially given that not all
 
05:33:16.590 --> 05:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
of us are technically skilled and
 
05:33:19.948 --> 05:33:19.958 align:start position:0%
determining from observation what is a
 
05:33:19.958 --> 05:33:20.868 align:start position:0%
determining from observation what is a
deep

05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
deep
 
05:33:27.990 --> 05:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:30.070 --> 05:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
you I'm I'm going to pinch it for
 
05:33:32.070 --> 05:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative brenon here um let's save
 
05:33:33.868 --> 05:33:33.878 align:start position:0%
those questions for exec um she is a
 
05:33:35.030 --> 05:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
member of the committee we're not going
 
05:33:36.990 --> 05:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
to vote on this the same day we exec it
 
05:33:38.910 --> 05:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
I promise you that this bill is going to
 
05:33:40.590 --> 05:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
need some work so if you'll excuse me

we'll we'll we'll put that one back in
 
05:33:43.190 --> 05:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
the pipe try to get some of our time
 
05:33:46.030 --> 05:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
back but it's a very valid question and
 
05:33:48.830 --> 05:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
I will say that I I understand that
 
05:33:50.548 --> 05:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
there may be some amendments to this
 
05:33:52.590 --> 05:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
bill that I'll be working on with my
 
05:33:55.830 --> 05:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor chairman Barry to address
 
05:33:58.070 --> 05:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
some concerns um there are a couple of
 
05:34:00.350 --> 05:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
language concerns as well as a misn
 
05:34:02.708 --> 05:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
numbering in the bill that is driving me
 
05:34:04.270 --> 05:34:04.280 align:start position:0%
crazy there's a reason this one's up on
 
05:34:07.350 --> 05:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
the first day I'll accept that as an
 
05:34:09.390 --> 05:34:09.400 align:start position:0%
answer for the time being thank you
 
05:34:10.548 --> 05:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
we're g to try to get some of our time
 
05:34:11.948 --> 05:34:11.958 align:start position:0%
because we could do that for all day for
 
05:34:13.110 --> 05:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
all I should have done that on the first
 
05:34:16.750 --> 05:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
question to be fair um other
 
05:34:19.070 --> 05:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
questions okay awesome uh thank you
 
05:34:20.948 --> 05:34:20.958 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan next up is
 
05:34:20.958 --> 05:34:24.788 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan next up is
representative

05:34:24.788 --> 05:34:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:27.708 --> 05:34:27.718 align:start position:0%
Maguire and uh we're running way behind
 
05:34:29.868 --> 05:34:29.878 align:start position:0%
now um so I'm going to limit every
 
05:34:31.470 --> 05:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
everybody to four
 
05:34:33.788 --> 05:34:33.798 align:start position:0%
minutes and try to get some of our time
 
05:34:36.070 --> 05:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
back I'll try to be half that thank you
 
05:34:38.190 --> 05:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for your
 
05:34:39.788 --> 05:34:39.798 align:start position:0%
thoughtfulness earlier I don't think
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
I've experienced that in any other
 
05:34:44.350 --> 05:34:44.360 align:start position:0%
committee um for the record my name is
 
05:34:46.670 --> 05:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
Dan Maguire I'm a co-sponsor of this
 
05:34:50.708 --> 05:34:50.718 align:start position:0%
bill um I I think it's a a very good
 
05:34:52.910 --> 05:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
idea we're talking here about something
 
05:34:56.510 --> 05:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
that amounts to fraud and um that's an
 
05:35:00.670 --> 05:35:00.680 align:start position:0%
exception to to uh free free speech is
 
05:35:04.670 --> 05:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
um things like deception and fraud um
 
05:35:06.510 --> 05:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean I don't think it
 
05:35:08.990 --> 05:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
can be improved and in particular I'll
 
05:35:11.510 --> 05:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
mention two things one is uh what
 
05:35:13.628 --> 05:35:13.638 align:start position:0%
representative weie brought up the 90
 
05:35:17.350 --> 05:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
days in my opinion there's no difference
 
05:35:19.830 --> 05:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
if you're committing fraud on 89 days
 
05:35:22.310 --> 05:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
you're committing it at on 91 days right
 
05:35:24.910 --> 05:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
I mean it doesn't make sense so to me
 
05:35:27.670 --> 05:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
anyways um the second thing is if you
 
05:35:31.110 --> 05:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
look at page two um that's where all the
 
05:35:34.030 --> 05:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions are and in particular um
 
05:35:37.350 --> 05:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
Roman 4 exceptions CD and
 
05:35:40.868 --> 05:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
E this I feel sort of somewhat
 
05:35:43.948 --> 05:35:43.958 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable about because I in general
 
05:35:46.548 --> 05:35:46.558 align:start position:0%
I don't think if you're if if you are
 
05:35:50.310 --> 05:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
committing a crime um and it should also
 
05:35:52.548 --> 05:35:52.558 align:start position:0%
be a crime for somebody else it it
 
05:35:55.350 --> 05:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't matter the characteristics of
 
05:35:57.350 --> 05:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
you and characteristics of the other
 
05:35:59.750 --> 05:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
person right I mean the either it's
 
05:36:02.788 --> 05:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
wrong or It Isn't So So this thing that
 
05:36:05.910 --> 05:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
makes exceptions if you're this kind of
 
05:36:08.150 --> 05:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
organization but not if you're that kind
 
05:36:08.160 --> 05:36:08.868 align:start position:0%
organization but not if you're that kind
of

05:36:08.868 --> 05:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:36:11.190 --> 05:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
organization that doesn't sit right with
 
05:36:14.750 --> 05:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
me so I would either eliminate those
 
05:36:18.070 --> 05:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
sections or re write them in some way
 
05:36:20.070 --> 05:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
and that's all my testimony thank you Mr
 
05:36:21.190 --> 05:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
chairman all right will you be taking
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
questions absolutely okay you questions
 
05:36:27.788 --> 05:36:27.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank uh next up Secretary
 
05:36:35.390 --> 05:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:36.788 --> 05:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:36:38.910 --> 05:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David scanland Secretary
 
05:36:42.310 --> 05:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
of State uh in support of this bill uh I
 
05:36:44.350 --> 05:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
can tell you that this is at the
 
05:36:46.548 --> 05:36:46.558 align:start position:0%
Forefront uh of the minds of every
 
05:36:49.948 --> 05:36:49.958 align:start position:0%
secretary of state in the country um I
 
05:36:52.990 --> 05:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
think this is a great first step um it's
 
05:36:56.750 --> 05:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
an issue that all of a sudden is here uh
 
05:36:59.708 --> 05:36:59.718 align:start position:0%
in full strength and it's going to take
 
05:37:02.110 --> 05:37:02.120 align:start position:0%
a little time I think to uh just wrap
 
05:37:05.270 --> 05:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
our arms around the scope uh and the
 
05:37:07.510 --> 05:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
best way to deal with it uh New
 
05:37:10.150 --> 05:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is at the Forefront of
 
05:37:11.948 --> 05:37:11.958 align:start position:0%
actually having an incident with
 
05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence impacting an
 
05:37:16.990 --> 05:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
election in the days just prior to the
 
05:37:20.030 --> 05:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
presidential primary there was a robo
 
05:37:22.190 --> 05:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
call that went out with President
 
05:37:26.470 --> 05:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
Biden's voice on it saying that uh
 
05:37:28.510 --> 05:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
telling voters to save their vote in the
 
05:37:30.708 --> 05:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
primary because it's more important uh
 
05:37:32.948 --> 05:37:32.958 align:start position:0%
in the general election uh so that's a
 
05:37:35.788 --> 05:37:35.798 align:start position:0%
form of voter suppression I'm happy to
 
05:37:38.510 --> 05:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
report that just this afternoon I saw a
 
05:37:39.788 --> 05:37:39.798 align:start position:0%
press release from the Attorney
 
05:37:41.590 --> 05:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
General's office apparently they have
 
05:37:43.830 --> 05:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
already caught the individual that was
 
05:37:48.350 --> 05:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for that uh uh that
 
05:37:51.030 --> 05:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
crime so I will stop there Mr chair be
 
05:37:53.110 --> 05:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions okay
 
05:37:55.150 --> 05:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
questions about the
 
05:37:57.670 --> 05:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
bill all right seeing none thank you
 
05:38:05.270 --> 05:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:07.310 --> 05:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
zinc good afternoon members of the
 
05:38:08.910 --> 05:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Olivia zinc a voter in
 
05:38:10.830 --> 05:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
Franklin and reading testimony on behalf
 
05:38:12.510 --> 05:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
of public Citizen and there 4,000
 
05:38:15.868 --> 05:38:15.878 align:start position:0%
members in New Hampshire um and I won't
 
05:38:17.110 --> 05:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
read all of this I'm just going to
 
05:38:20.270 --> 05:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
paraphrase a few sentences um it's the
 
05:38:23.150 --> 05:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
rapid advancements in deep te techn deep
 
05:38:25.670 --> 05:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
fake technology is very concerning in
 
05:38:29.548 --> 05:38:29.558 align:start position:0%
our upcoming elections um this is a real
 
05:38:33.350 --> 05:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
really major threat to our democracy and
 
05:38:35.628 --> 05:38:35.638 align:start position:0%
um poses a real threat so this
 
05:38:39.150 --> 05:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
legislation can help um make sure that
 
05:38:41.030 --> 05:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
disclosure of these deep fake
 
05:38:43.070 --> 05:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
communication it's very critical that we
 
05:38:45.708 --> 05:38:45.718 align:start position:0%
have that disclosure and transparency in
 
05:38:48.430 --> 05:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
our elections um House Bill
 
05:38:51.788 --> 05:38:51.798 align:start position:0%
1596 includes key elements um to
 
05:38:56.030 --> 05:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
mitigate the Prof uh potential harms um
 
05:38:58.030 --> 05:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
and I think that you know you talked a
 
05:38:59.788 --> 05:38:59.798 align:start position:0%
little bit about the 90 days but also
 
05:39:01.868 --> 05:39:01.878 align:start position:0%
the fact that it does carve out
 
05:39:04.750 --> 05:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
exceptions um for legitimate media
 
05:39:08.788 --> 05:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
sources um and also um any kind of
 
05:39:11.788 --> 05:39:11.798 align:start position:0%
satire or parody um but we do urge this
 
05:39:15.230 --> 05:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
committee to um OTP or ought to pass
 
05:39:19.110 --> 05:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
this bill um because of the much needed
 
05:39:20.948 --> 05:39:20.958 align:start position:0%
regulation to protect voters our
 
05:39:22.548 --> 05:39:22.558 align:start position:0%
election and our democracy from the
 
05:39:25.548 --> 05:39:25.558 align:start position:0%
harms of deep fake and artificial
 
05:39:27.948 --> 05:39:27.958 align:start position:0%
intelligence questions from the
 
05:39:31.830 --> 05:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um last
 
05:39:33.910 --> 05:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
up or last at least with the pink card
 
05:39:38.670 --> 05:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:47.310 --> 05:39:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:49.390 --> 05:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
right all
 
05:39:51.948 --> 05:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
right uh hello my name is Autumn rashik
 
05:39:53.788 --> 05:39:53.798 align:start position:0%
Goodwin I'm a voter from Manchester New
 
05:39:55.390 --> 05:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the program coordinator with
 
05:39:57.390 --> 05:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
open democracy action where a
 
05:39:59.910 --> 05:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit representing 6,000
 
05:40:02.390 --> 05:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
voters in New Hampshire um I'm not going
 
05:40:04.070 --> 05:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
to read through all of this either
 
05:40:05.708 --> 05:40:05.718 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the points have already
 
05:40:09.670 --> 05:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
been made um really with the speed at
 
05:40:11.510 --> 05:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
with this technology is
 
05:40:14.310 --> 05:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
advancing it is already possible to
 
05:40:17.110 --> 05:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
completely mimic someone's voice these
 
05:40:19.310 --> 05:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
Technologies work similar to neural
 
05:40:22.510 --> 05:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
networks and they're able to learn
 
05:40:26.430 --> 05:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
faster and faster as it goes on um they
 
05:40:29.468 --> 05:40:29.478 align:start position:0%
pose a particular danger to politics and
 
05:40:29.478 --> 05:40:30.708 align:start position:0%
pose a particular danger to politics and
political

05:40:30.708 --> 05:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
political
 
05:40:34.310 --> 05:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
figures because politicians are
 
05:40:36.468 --> 05:40:36.478 align:start position:0%
constantly in the public eye how many
 
05:40:37.868 --> 05:40:37.878 align:start position:0%
live stream hearings have you been a
 
05:40:40.270 --> 05:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
part of how many interviews how many
 
05:40:43.190 --> 05:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
public appearances this is the reality
 
05:40:45.990 --> 05:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
that public figures face every
 
05:40:46.000 --> 05:40:48.310 align:start position:0%
that public figures face every
day

05:40:48.310 --> 05:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:40:51.190 --> 05:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
so I hope that the committee supports HB
 
05:40:54.468 --> 05:40:54.478 align:start position:0%
1596 with a vote of all to pass okay
 
05:40:56.948 --> 05:40:56.958 align:start position:0%

05:41:00.990 --> 05:41:01.000 align:start position:0%

me move things along uh relative to the
 
05:41:54.708 --> 05:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
durable and tamperproof containers for
 
05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
preserving ballots um I don't think I've
 
05:41:58.798 --> 05:42:00.350 align:start position:0%
preserving ballots um I don't think I've
seen

05:42:00.350 --> 05:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
seen
 
05:42:02.310 --> 05:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
oh here he
 
05:42:10.468 --> 05:42:10.478 align:start position:0%

just one moment all right uh thank you
 
05:42:36.628 --> 05:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and honorable committee members
 
05:42:38.868 --> 05:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Robert warry I
 
05:42:41.030 --> 05:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
have the privilege of serving in
 
05:42:43.350 --> 05:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County District
 
05:42:46.868 --> 05:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
13 um the barely buic town of
 
05:42:46.878 --> 05:42:49.350 align:start position:0%
13 um the barely buic town of
Hudson

05:42:49.350 --> 05:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
Hudson
 
05:42:53.948 --> 05:42:53.958 align:start position:0%
and um with regard to uh this bill there
 
05:42:56.350 --> 05:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
there'll be other testimony about the
 
05:42:58.230 --> 05:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
current boxes and some of their
 
05:43:02.708 --> 05:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
deficiencies but um just uh to introduce
 
05:43:04.910 --> 05:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
this the secure handling and storage of
 
05:43:07.270 --> 05:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
the ballots post elction day is
 
05:43:09.190 --> 05:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
essential for providing assurance that
 
05:43:11.350 --> 05:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
ballots have been properly retained
 
05:43:14.230 --> 05:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
until a the completion of any necessary
 
05:43:16.070 --> 05:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
or requested
 
05:43:18.468 --> 05:43:18.478 align:start position:0%
recounts B the completion of any
 
05:43:21.910 --> 05:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
necessary audits or investigations and C
 
05:43:23.670 --> 05:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
the completion of any state Andor
 
05:43:25.670 --> 05:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements for this retention
 
05:43:29.350 --> 05:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
of ballots and related election records
 
05:43:32.430 --> 05:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
when there are cardboard boxes used for
 
05:43:35.628 --> 05:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
storage they're not uh ergonomically
 
05:43:38.230 --> 05:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
friendly for handling by town and City
 
05:43:41.510 --> 05:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
Clerks and some of the Recycled and
 
05:43:43.430 --> 05:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
reused cardboard boxes are not
 
05:43:45.430 --> 05:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
sufficiently durable or
 
05:43:48.110 --> 05:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
stackable a as indicated by the collapse
 
05:43:50.390 --> 05:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
of stacked stored boxes as witnessed
 
05:43:54.110 --> 05:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
during uh routine storage recounts and
 
05:43:57.150 --> 05:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
audits so um this bill is really
 
05:44:01.270 --> 05:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
proposing that uh better containers be
 
05:44:04.548 --> 05:44:04.558 align:start position:0%
provided for the uh use in preserving
 
05:44:06.990 --> 05:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
ballots that they would be more durable
 
05:44:10.310 --> 05:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
than our current kind of cardboard boxes
 
05:44:13.948 --> 05:44:13.958 align:start position:0%
and that they would also be uh in a such
 
05:44:15.390 --> 05:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
a state that they could be rendered
 
05:44:18.670 --> 05:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
tamper proof um with that I'll happy to
 
05:44:20.310 --> 05:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
take any questions all right questions
 
05:44:21.468 --> 05:44:21.478 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:44:23.510 --> 05:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none you're going to
 
05:44:26.430 --> 05:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
get off easy okay uh next up our own
 
05:44:37.510 --> 05:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:38.910 --> 05:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:44:40.510 --> 05:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
committee members I'm representative
 
05:44:42.310 --> 05:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
Claud Burnham from straford County
 
05:44:46.270 --> 05:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
District 2 um many of you may have seen
 
05:44:49.510 --> 05:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
um some of um the recycled cardboard
 
05:44:51.390 --> 05:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
boxes that I've carried completed
 
05:44:53.670 --> 05:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
ballots to and from town or city offices
 
05:44:54.708 --> 05:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
to other
 
05:44:57.230 --> 05:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
facilities and even for possible hand
 
05:44:59.990 --> 05:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
count uh the cardboard boxes and taping
 
05:45:02.350 --> 05:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
tend to weaken or even ruin the
 
05:45:04.350 --> 05:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
structure of the Box uh that are
 
05:45:06.190 --> 05:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to keep completed and unused
 
05:45:08.310 --> 05:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
balance secure for a period of time in a
 
05:45:08.320 --> 05:45:09.270 align:start position:0%
balance secure for a period of time in a
secure

05:45:09.270 --> 05:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
secure
 
05:45:13.150 --> 05:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
location HB 1370 provides a secure
 
05:45:15.548 --> 05:45:15.558 align:start position:0%
durable and portable unit that not only
 
05:45:19.270 --> 05:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
provides easy wheel
 
05:45:21.830 --> 05:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation um I gave a sample of
 
05:45:24.190 --> 05:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
what one could look like because this
 
05:45:26.788 --> 05:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
was what was uh provided at
 
05:45:30.468 --> 05:45:30.478 align:start position:0%
um um secretary Estates uh demonstration
 
05:45:33.548 --> 05:45:33.558 align:start position:0%
of three machines early last year and I
 
05:45:35.468 --> 05:45:35.478 align:start position:0%
found that very interesting so I had
 
05:45:38.468 --> 05:45:38.478 align:start position:0%
some photos to share um of what that
 
05:45:41.430 --> 05:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
would look like um so this particular
 
05:45:44.830 --> 05:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
one does have wheels it has a a pullout
 
05:45:48.030 --> 05:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
handle um it does have a lock
 
05:45:51.590 --> 05:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
feature um can even probably use one of
 
05:45:53.910 --> 05:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
those safety seals that's even used on
 
05:45:56.670 --> 05:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
the machines themselves uh it's just a
 
05:45:59.310 --> 05:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
suggestion certainly not the end result
 
05:46:01.590 --> 05:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
but um I just wanted you to have a
 
05:46:04.430 --> 05:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
little visual um and also uh this
 
05:46:07.270 --> 05:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
particular feature uh this one fit into
 
05:46:10.270 --> 05:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
the actual box itself of the
 
05:46:10.280 --> 05:46:13.070 align:start position:0%
the actual box itself of the
machine

05:46:13.070 --> 05:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
machine
 
05:46:13.080 --> 05:46:16.430 align:start position:0%
machine
um

05:46:16.430 --> 05:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:18.788 --> 05:46:18.798 align:start position:0%
so the other advantage of having
 
05:46:20.468 --> 05:46:20.478 align:start position:0%
something like this is that it's
 
05:46:24.230 --> 05:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
portable by a pulled handle we uh for
 
05:46:25.750 --> 05:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
anybody that's been involved in
 
05:46:29.510 --> 05:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
elections I have helped move these boxes
 
05:46:32.468 --> 05:46:32.478 align:start position:0%
or carried these boxes it's not an easy
 
05:46:35.830 --> 05:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
task and they're very heavy and as you
 
05:46:40.110 --> 05:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
know um cardboard tends to um get flimsy
 
05:46:42.910 --> 05:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
so um having something that's a plastic
 
05:46:45.350 --> 05:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
container uh that can probably Inc case
 
05:46:49.270 --> 05:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
more ballots um and not just multiple
 
05:46:53.548 --> 05:46:53.558 align:start position:0%
boxes uh would be helpful as well um
 
05:46:57.230 --> 05:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh manages as a storage unit
 
05:46:59.868 --> 05:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
so they're stackable easy uh to be
 
05:47:02.590 --> 05:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
stored in um a safe
 
05:47:06.510 --> 05:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
location and um town and City Clerks no
 
05:47:09.190 --> 05:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
longer need to lift the heavy boxes they
 
05:47:11.990 --> 05:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
can wheel them around so um this
 
05:47:14.788 --> 05:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
particular distributor I believe was ESS
 
05:47:17.510 --> 05:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
that shared uh this container
 
05:47:19.150 --> 05:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when I did look on their
 
05:47:21.190 --> 05:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
website they don't have this product for
 
05:47:23.310 --> 05:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
sale so I'm not sure where they got it I
 
05:47:25.310 --> 05:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
tried looking around I'm not sure if
 
05:47:27.948 --> 05:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
this one was particularly made for this
 
05:47:29.750 --> 05:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
demonstration or if they're available
 
05:47:32.788 --> 05:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
but I would certainly be um available to
 
05:47:34.750 --> 05:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
help find out other
 
05:47:37.350 --> 05:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
resources uh thank you okay can we
 
05:47:39.030 --> 05:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
taking questions sure all right
 
05:47:40.190 --> 05:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:47:43.030 --> 05:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none all right next up
 
05:47:45.430 --> 05:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
was David scalin from the Secretary of
 
05:47:56.110 --> 05:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:58.788 --> 05:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
there thank you Mr chairman members the
 
05:48:00.708 --> 05:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David scanlin Secretary of
 
05:48:03.670 --> 05:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
State and Mr chairman I have to say
 
05:48:05.110 --> 05:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
given the number of bills on this
 
05:48:07.390 --> 05:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
calendar today when I first saw it I
 
05:48:08.590 --> 05:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
thought you were going to be here till 8
 
05:48:11.390 --> 05:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
o'clock tonight but it's very impressive
 
05:48:13.150 --> 05:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
job that you've kept everything the
 
05:48:15.030 --> 05:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
Train's on
 
05:48:18.510 --> 05:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
time um I just wanted to give a little
 
05:48:21.750 --> 05:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
information uh on this bill um and a
 
05:48:24.510 --> 05:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
little history uh when I first started
 
05:48:26.110 --> 05:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
working in the Secretary of State's
 
05:48:28.590 --> 05:48:28.600 align:start position:0%
office probably 20 years ago actually
 
05:48:29.708 --> 05:48:29.718 align:start position:0%
more than
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
that uh there was no uniformity to the
 
05:48:36.270 --> 05:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
storage containers that ballots were put
 
05:48:39.990 --> 05:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
in and I can recall uh having ballots
 
05:48:43.310 --> 05:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
coming in from various towns uh for
 
05:48:47.230 --> 05:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
recounts that were just all shapes sizes
 
05:48:49.390 --> 05:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
conditions I remember one box in
 
05:48:50.910 --> 05:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
particular that was labeled medical
 
05:48:53.708 --> 05:48:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:53.718 --> 05:48:55.590 align:start position:0%
 
outside

05:48:55.590 --> 05:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
outside
 
05:48:59.150 --> 05:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
and no I'm not kidding
 
05:49:02.270 --> 05:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
um so you know we have made progress
 
05:49:05.390 --> 05:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
since then there been an attempt to the
 
05:49:08.510 --> 05:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
state provides the boxes now they are uh
 
05:49:11.628 --> 05:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
fairly sturdy they're uniform inside
 
05:49:14.190 --> 05:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
size they have printing on them that
 
05:49:17.190 --> 05:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
that uh designates them as balloting
 
05:49:20.708 --> 05:49:20.718 align:start position:0%
materials um we use red security tape on
 
05:49:25.270 --> 05:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
them and uh and we do training which uh
 
05:49:26.948 --> 05:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
you know gets us partway there but there
 
05:49:31.948 --> 05:49:31.958 align:start position:0%
are always individuals that uh will uh
 
05:49:34.868 --> 05:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
close the boxes and seal them however
 
05:49:38.230 --> 05:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
they feel like they want to do it so um
 
05:49:39.990 --> 05:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
I understand that you know I think
 
05:49:41.708 --> 05:49:41.718 align:start position:0%
although things have progressed they
 
05:49:44.670 --> 05:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
they certainly are not perfect um when
 
05:49:46.788 --> 05:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
this bill came up you know I I thought
 
05:49:50.030 --> 05:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
about this a little bit and actually
 
05:49:52.190 --> 05:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
went to the local Lowe's store and took
 
05:49:55.190 --> 05:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
a look at the totes that they have uh in
 
05:49:58.030 --> 05:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
their aisles and there are some pretty
 
05:50:02.510 --> 05:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
rugged plastic containers out there that
 
05:50:05.468 --> 05:50:05.478 align:start position:0%
um you know are the right size I mean
 
05:50:07.590 --> 05:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
they're not on Wheels but but they are
 
05:50:10.150 --> 05:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
of a size that it would be an easy
 
05:50:12.670 --> 05:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
weight for somebody to handle somewhat
 
05:50:14.708 --> 05:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
similar to the size of the boxes that we
 
05:50:17.750 --> 05:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
use uh for ballots they have hard
 
05:50:20.788 --> 05:50:20.798 align:start position:0%
plastic Lids on them that are flat so
 
05:50:23.750 --> 05:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
they're stackable and they have holes
 
05:50:26.910 --> 05:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
that go through them so that locks or uh
 
05:50:30.548 --> 05:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
wire seals numbered seals could be
 
05:50:32.830 --> 05:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
placed on them so something like that
 
05:50:36.468 --> 05:50:36.478 align:start position:0%
would fit the bill you know a container
 
05:50:40.708 --> 05:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
that might hold 1,500 ballots would cost
 
05:50:44.868 --> 05:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh on the Shelf retail was about $17 so
 
05:50:47.390 --> 05:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sure if we put that out to bid uh
 
05:50:49.310 --> 05:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
ordered in bulk that that price could
 
05:50:51.590 --> 05:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
come down
 
05:50:53.590 --> 05:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
substantially and then in terms of how
 
05:50:57.110 --> 05:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
many we would need uh you know for for
 
05:50:58.948 --> 05:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
general election
 
05:51:02.350 --> 05:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh we probably need a th000 for a state
 
05:51:02.360 --> 05:51:04.070 align:start position:0%
uh we probably need a th000 for a state
primary

05:51:04.070 --> 05:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
primary
 
05:51:08.270 --> 05:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
500 for a presidential primary another
 
05:51:12.548 --> 05:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
500 so probably a couple thousand boxes
 
05:51:14.990 --> 05:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
containers and then containers for
 
05:51:17.270 --> 05:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
absentee balloting materials the you
 
05:51:18.788 --> 05:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
know the envelopes the affidavit
 
05:51:21.390 --> 05:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
envelopes things like that and then
 
05:51:25.110 --> 05:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
having a you know an inventory of extras
 
05:51:26.270 --> 05:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
you know we'll probably be looking at
 
05:51:29.350 --> 05:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
about 4,000 of those
 
05:51:33.030 --> 05:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
um I would prefer not to be in the
 
05:51:37.070 --> 05:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
inventory management of those boxes so
 
05:51:38.708 --> 05:51:38.718 align:start position:0%
what you know what I would suggest is
 
05:51:40.708 --> 05:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
that they get issued to the cities and
 
05:51:43.750 --> 05:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
the towns in adequate num so that they
 
05:51:47.910 --> 05:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
would have enough on hand and then every
 
05:51:49.750 --> 05:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
time we have an election send the
 
05:51:53.030 --> 05:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
ballots to the towns in the boxes that
 
05:51:55.948 --> 05:51:55.958 align:start position:0%
we use now which certainly hold up for
 
05:51:58.590 --> 05:51:58.600 align:start position:0%
that purpose uh have the local election
 
05:52:00.030 --> 05:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
officials count the ballots which
 
05:52:02.230 --> 05:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
they're required to do in statute and
 
05:52:04.910 --> 05:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
then they can put them in those uh those
 
05:52:07.548 --> 05:52:07.558 align:start position:0%
totes when that job is done I think
 
05:52:11.270 --> 05:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
something like that would work the um
 
05:52:12.750 --> 05:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
the only additional thing that I wanted
 
05:52:16.868 --> 05:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
to point out was that this uh bill would
 
05:52:20.670 --> 05:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
also apply to local elections as it's
 
05:52:23.948 --> 05:52:23.958 align:start position:0%
currently written which means uh towns
 
05:52:27.510 --> 05:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
schools and uh Village districts and the
 
05:52:30.670 --> 05:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
reason I come to that conclusion is in
 
05:52:34.708 --> 05:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
chapter RC 669 colon 25 which talks
 
05:52:36.910 --> 05:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
about the conduct of Elections for the
 
05:52:40.830 --> 05:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
local level uh they say that you know
 
05:52:43.030 --> 05:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of a local
 
05:52:46.510 --> 05:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
election uh the the
 
05:52:51.310 --> 05:52:51.320 align:start position:0%
uh the chapters 658 and 659 also apply
 
05:52:54.510 --> 05:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
to town election so by passing a
 
05:52:57.788 --> 05:52:57.798 align:start position:0%
provision in chapter 659 it's also going
 
05:53:00.990 --> 05:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
to apply to local elections and I'd be
 
05:53:03.270 --> 05:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions okay
 
05:53:04.830 --> 05:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:53:07.150 --> 05:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
05:53:10.270 --> 05:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
Hammer thank you for taking my question
 
05:53:15.030 --> 05:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
I like the idea of the plastic boxes but
 
05:53:17.110 --> 05:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we have to seal them with the
 
05:53:20.430 --> 05:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
red tape and wouldn't that all be left
 
05:53:23.670 --> 05:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
on there Gunk up and they look off old
 
05:53:26.270 --> 05:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
trashy eventually I I think with the
 
05:53:28.590 --> 05:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
plastic totes you could eliminate the
 
05:53:32.670 --> 05:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
red tape uh and the reason for that is
 
05:53:34.230 --> 05:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
05:53:37.030 --> 05:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
alternative access so on a cardboard box
 
05:53:39.430 --> 05:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
there's two there's two ways that you
 
05:53:42.430 --> 05:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
can enter it so the tape seals both of
 
05:53:45.868 --> 05:53:45.878 align:start position:0%
those but in a tote it's it's just going
 
05:53:48.150 --> 05:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
in from the top and once the cover is on
 
05:53:53.310 --> 05:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
there and it has a a numbered wire seal
 
05:53:55.350 --> 05:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
placed on it and a padlock it would
 
05:53:57.390 --> 05:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
still require the seal that all of the
 
05:53:58.830 --> 05:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
election officials
 
05:54:01.548 --> 05:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
has to sign going over it but it would
 
05:54:03.590 --> 05:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
pretty much eliminate the need for red
 
05:54:06.990 --> 05:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
tape eliminating red tape in election
 
05:54:10.628 --> 05:54:10.638 align:start position:0%
law I knew what a day I just let's go
 
05:54:13.830 --> 05:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
home now representative Howard thank you
 
05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
so much and thank you for taking my
 
05:54:17.670 --> 05:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
question uh so in the bill the effective
 
05:54:20.590 --> 05:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
date says that the ACT will take effect
 
05:54:24.430 --> 05:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
60 days after uh passage uh are we are
 
05:54:26.948 --> 05:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
you going to be able to provide uh these
 
05:54:29.910 --> 05:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
these uh reusable transportable boxes uh
 
05:54:31.830 --> 05:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
in time for the next
 
05:54:34.110 --> 05:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
election I think it's I think that's
 
05:54:38.230 --> 05:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
doable provided the money's there and um
 
05:54:40.910 --> 05:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
you know if these are if they were you
 
05:54:43.190 --> 05:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
know if we need 4,000 and let's say
 
05:54:46.110 --> 05:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
they're $10 a piece that's
 
05:54:48.708 --> 05:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
$40,000 right thank
 
05:54:51.868 --> 05:54:51.878 align:start position:0%
you representative P O'Brien thank you I
 
05:54:53.190 --> 05:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
just want to State I was going to make a
 
05:54:55.230 --> 05:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
havam money joke there and I chose not
 
05:54:57.510 --> 05:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
to I just want to put it on the record I
 
05:54:59.310 --> 05:54:59.320 align:start position:0%
was going to make the joke and decided
 
05:54:59.320 --> 05:55:02.430 align:start position:0%
was going to make the joke and decided
not

05:55:02.430 --> 05:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:06.190 --> 05:55:06.200 align:start position:0%
to so the wire seal would be similar to
 
05:55:08.270 --> 05:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
what they put on the electronic ballot
 
05:55:10.548 --> 05:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
counting machines when those are tested
 
05:55:11.510 --> 05:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
is that what you're talking about it
 
05:55:12.830 --> 05:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
would be similar to that yeah I mean
 
05:55:14.190 --> 05:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
obviously we would want something that
 
05:55:16.788 --> 05:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
is as rugged as it could be so that you
 
05:55:18.830 --> 05:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
know when they're handled the Seal's not
 
05:55:20.590 --> 05:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:55:23.708 --> 05:55:23.718 align:start position:0%
break would the would it be a problem if
 
05:55:23.718 --> 05:55:24.830 align:start position:0%
break would the would it be a problem if
those

05:55:24.830 --> 05:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:55:29.150 --> 05:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
were um if they were taken out of
 
05:55:31.510 --> 05:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
commission so to speak in a community
 
05:55:33.830 --> 05:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
when there's a recount done and those
 
05:55:36.468 --> 05:55:36.478 align:start position:0%
boxes go up to the state level and that
 
05:55:38.510 --> 05:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
means maybe there'd be another election
 
05:55:40.590 --> 05:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
coming down the pike and then the
 
05:55:42.230 --> 05:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
community wouldn't have them would you
 
05:55:45.990 --> 05:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
just have a bank of them at at the state
 
05:55:47.510 --> 05:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
archives or something like that to then
 
05:55:50.030 --> 05:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
just keep sending out to the towns I I
 
05:55:52.070 --> 05:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
should have said not withstanding
 
05:55:54.910 --> 05:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
recounts I mean obviously we have to
 
05:55:58.030 --> 05:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
bring those ballots to conquered uh you
 
05:55:59.190 --> 05:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
know in those
 
05:56:01.990 --> 05:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
containers we keep we currently keep the
 
05:56:04.708 --> 05:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
boxes of ballots from a recount for the
 
05:56:07.190 --> 05:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
required 22 months just like they have
 
05:56:10.910 --> 05:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
to do in the towns and then and then uh
 
05:56:13.190 --> 05:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
after that time frame is up we destroy
 
05:56:16.670 --> 05:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
them in this instance we would destroy
 
05:56:19.230 --> 05:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
the ballots we would we would hold them
 
05:56:21.110 --> 05:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
destroy the ballots and then send the
 
05:56:22.670 --> 05:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
containers back to the towns that they
 
05:56:22.680 --> 05:56:26.230 align:start position:0%
containers back to the towns that they
came

05:56:26.230 --> 05:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:30.310 --> 05:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
from okay uh represent quy thank you Mr
 
05:56:33.070 --> 05:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
chairman the 4,000 estimate would that
 
05:56:35.030 --> 05:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
include the need to retain ballots for
 
05:56:35.040 --> 05:56:36.670 align:start position:0%
include the need to retain ballots for
22

05:56:36.670 --> 05:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
22
 
05:56:39.270 --> 05:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
months yes the the the ballots would
 
05:56:41.670 --> 05:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
have to remain in those containers for
 
05:56:41.680 --> 05:56:42.948 align:start position:0%
have to remain in those containers for
22

05:56:42.948 --> 05:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
22
 
05:56:45.708 --> 05:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
months period right so that would that
 
05:56:47.910 --> 05:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
that requirement would be
 
05:56:50.990 --> 05:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
satisfied by 4,000 boxes
 
05:56:55.150 --> 05:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
roughly yes the 22 months allows you to
 
05:56:56.670 --> 05:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
destroy the ballots free up the
 
05:56:59.390 --> 05:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
containers before the next election for
 
05:57:00.990 --> 05:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
that many thank
 
05:57:04.510 --> 05:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
you further questions seeing none thank
 
05:57:06.708 --> 05:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the for the revity or
 
05:57:10.310 --> 05:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
levity I should say um brevity as well
 
05:57:22.468 --> 05:57:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:26.628 --> 05:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
Bean Michael Bean 112 Grove Road in
 
05:57:29.510 --> 05:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
Ry uh the Secretary of State this is an
 
05:57:31.990 --> 05:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
easy one I think that we all can Embrace
 
05:57:34.948 --> 05:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State ballot law commission
 
05:57:36.750 --> 05:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
everyone seems to recognize the
 
05:57:39.670 --> 05:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
importance of maintaining the Integrity
 
05:57:41.910 --> 05:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh we actually have sealed ballot boxes
 
05:57:44.270 --> 05:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
chain of custody and storage log as an
 
05:57:44.280 --> 05:57:45.390 align:start position:0%
chain of custody and storage log as an
RSA

05:57:45.390 --> 05:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
05:57:48.830 --> 05:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
requirement uh there's a copy of copy of
 
05:57:48.840 --> 05:57:49.548 align:start position:0%
requirement uh there's a copy of copy of
the

05:57:49.548 --> 05:57:49.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:57:53.830 --> 05:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
document here unfortunately U during our
 
05:57:56.548 --> 05:57:56.558 align:start position:0%
uh recounts they were not all completed
 
05:57:59.548 --> 05:57:59.558 align:start position:0%
but the the importance of the log should
 
05:58:02.590 --> 05:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
easily be recognized and the ballots
 
05:58:04.670 --> 05:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
have to be stored from the night of the
 
05:58:07.510 --> 05:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
election to uh date of Destruction which
 
05:58:10.948 --> 05:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
has pre previously been addressed but
 
05:58:13.910 --> 05:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
this this one I think is rather mundane
 
05:58:16.948 --> 05:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
and that you're not um we're not
 
05:58:19.708 --> 05:58:19.718 align:start position:0%
impacting anybody's right to vote we're
 
05:58:21.310 --> 05:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
not there's nothing threatening about
 
05:58:24.030 --> 05:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill and all we're doing
 
05:58:28.350 --> 05:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
is trying to maintain the uh integrity
 
05:58:31.030 --> 05:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
of the actual ballots themselves so I
 
05:58:32.990 --> 05:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
would I would I would think it would be
 
05:58:35.948 --> 05:58:35.958 align:start position:0%
something readily uh embraceable if you
 
05:58:40.190 --> 05:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
will um we had this type of situation
 
05:58:43.708 --> 05:58:43.718 align:start position:0%
during our recount our box our towns
 
05:58:47.150 --> 05:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
that we did the recount for had never
 
05:58:49.350 --> 05:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
experienced another recount in that in
 
05:58:52.708 --> 05:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
that season in that election Series so
 
05:58:54.590 --> 05:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
the boxes were being seen for the first
 
05:58:57.948 --> 05:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
time from the town to the to the uh
 
05:59:00.390 --> 05:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
building for the recount and we had
 
05:59:03.110 --> 05:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
pictures like this where the boxes are
 
05:59:06.910 --> 05:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
opened the tape says void um we have
 
05:59:08.708 --> 05:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
labels peeled
 
05:59:11.708 --> 05:59:11.718 align:start position:0%
back as you'll see here with the labels
 
05:59:14.628 --> 05:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
pulled right off the boxes so the system
 
05:59:17.230 --> 05:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
that we currently have is is is not
 
05:59:21.390 --> 05:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
great I am fully in favor of using
 
05:59:26.350 --> 05:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
sealable uh uh uh sealed with a Ys seal
 
05:59:28.230 --> 05:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
containers to Main maintain that
 
05:59:31.270 --> 05:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
Integrity we're supposed to have um
 
05:59:34.310 --> 05:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot materials in a blue box
 
05:59:36.548 --> 05:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
ballots in a red box those would have to
 
05:59:39.150 --> 05:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
be that that distinction uh would have
 
05:59:42.830 --> 05:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
to still be made but that was violated
 
05:59:46.190 --> 05:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
um over and over again throughout the
 
05:59:50.750 --> 05:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
analysis that we did for the recount and
 
05:59:53.190 --> 05:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
um we have a I have a current situation
 
05:59:55.350 --> 05:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
as I told you right now I have I've
 
05:59:56.548 --> 05:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
written to the Secretary of State
 
05:59:59.590 --> 05:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office in my town uh
 
06:00:01.390 --> 06:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
requesting an investigation for the
 
06:00:04.830 --> 06:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
January 23rd those ballots must maintain
 
06:00:07.670 --> 06:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
their integrity until that investigation
 
06:00:12.270 --> 06:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
gets closed out um we had U
 
06:00:14.990 --> 06:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
undervotes on a on a vote for one we had
 
06:00:17.910 --> 06:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
many many undervotes no rationale for it
 
06:00:22.070 --> 06:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
it was later corrected and uh without an
 
06:00:24.390 --> 06:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
explanation so consequently the machine
 
06:00:26.468 --> 06:00:26.478 align:start position:0%
count was wrong and it got modified
 
06:00:29.468 --> 06:00:29.478 align:start position:0%
later I I I can't speculate why that's
 
06:00:31.868 --> 06:00:31.878 align:start position:0%
why we're asking for the investigation
 
06:00:35.948 --> 06:00:35.958 align:start position:0%
the Box the ballots should be uh they
 
06:00:38.670 --> 06:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
should maintain their integrity until
 
06:00:40.310 --> 06:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
all of those investigations are
 
06:00:43.110 --> 06:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
completed so
 
06:00:45.070 --> 06:00:45.080 align:start position:0%
uh I don't I don't think there's
 
06:00:47.708 --> 06:00:47.718 align:start position:0%
anything threatening about this to uh as
 
06:00:49.548 --> 06:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
I as I previously stated jeopardizing
 
06:00:51.070 --> 06:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's right to vote it just
 
06:00:53.350 --> 06:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
maintains the Integrity of the election
 
06:00:55.350 --> 06:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
that took place and I would ask you all
 
06:00:57.150 --> 06:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
to support it thank you okay will you be
 
06:01:00.190 --> 06:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:02.030 --> 06:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
committee we didn't answer that question
 
06:01:04.990 --> 06:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going say no um thank you um all
 
06:01:07.230 --> 06:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
right we had one two people signed up in
 
06:01:09.708 --> 06:01:09.718 align:start position:0%
person who did not speak uh both signed
 
06:01:12.070 --> 06:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
up in favor of the bill online it was 11
 
06:01:14.868 --> 06:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
support to opposed uh with that having
 
06:01:16.350 --> 06:01:16.360 align:start position:0%
no one else signed up to speak I'm going
 
06:01:19.190 --> 06:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
to close the Committee hearing on House
 
06:01:21.548 --> 06:01:21.558 align:start position:0%
Bill 1370 the committee will stand in
 
06:01:26.430 --> 06:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:26.440 --> 06:04:42.708 align:start position:0%
 
p.m.

06:04:42.708 --> 06:04:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:44.390 --> 06:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay it's
 
06:04:46.510 --> 06:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
3:00 uh going to open up the public
 
06:04:49.150 --> 06:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1364 relative to
 
06:04:51.628 --> 06:04:51.638 align:start position:0%
intimidation of election officers
 
06:04:53.910 --> 06:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
improper influence over the electoral
 
06:04:56.270 --> 06:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
process and tampering with electronic
 
06:04:59.910 --> 06:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
ballot Counting devices um I need a pink
 
06:05:01.590 --> 06:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
card from you at some point no you don't
 
06:05:03.910 --> 06:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
need it now represent if you talk about
 
06:05:05.390 --> 06:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
the right bill I'll I'll I won't need
 
06:05:07.150 --> 06:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
the pink card that's a joke I'm willing
 
06:05:09.910 --> 06:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
to bet Mr chair that um the pink card I
 
06:05:12.708 --> 06:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
handed in earlier on the other bill has
 
06:05:15.270 --> 06:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
this bill number on it it would if I
 
06:05:16.750 --> 06:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
hadn't had corrected the pink card for
 
06:05:20.350 --> 06:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
you oh okay very well um thank you uh Mr
 
06:05:21.590 --> 06:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you members of the
 
06:05:23.750 --> 06:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
committee once again and I know you just
 
06:05:25.350 --> 06:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
heard this so my name is Ellen Reed I
 
06:05:27.030 --> 06:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham 10 new market
 
06:05:29.430 --> 06:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
Market in new Fields I have before you
 
06:05:32.708 --> 06:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
today HB 1364 correct Bill and I'm going
 
06:05:34.030 --> 06:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
I already told you a little bit about it
 
06:05:37.788 --> 06:05:37.798 align:start position:0%
I think but um the bill ads needed
 
06:05:40.030 --> 06:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
protection a stronger language for
 
06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
election worker protections as well as
 
06:05:44.190 --> 06:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
stronger language to prevent tampering
 
06:05:46.070 --> 06:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
with the electoral
 
06:05:49.510 --> 06:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
process um so a little bit on the
 
06:05:53.030 --> 06:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
background uh onethird of our election
 
06:05:56.030 --> 06:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
workers across the country uh left their
 
06:05:59.468 --> 06:05:59.478 align:start position:0%
positions by by 2022 the 2022 election
 
06:06:02.030 --> 06:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
cycle because of increased intimidation
 
06:06:06.070 --> 06:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
of election workers um one out of five
 
06:06:09.190 --> 06:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
additionally plan to leave by the 2024
 
06:06:12.310 --> 06:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
election in some states as many as half
 
06:06:14.270 --> 06:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
of all election workers have quit their
 
06:06:17.350 --> 06:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
jobs um and many citing um increased
 
06:06:21.150 --> 06:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
intimidation as a main cause 79% of
 
06:06:22.788 --> 06:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
election workers across the country
 
06:06:25.030 --> 06:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
believe that stronger protections are
 
06:06:27.350 --> 06:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
needed to allow them to do their job
 
06:06:30.390 --> 06:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
properly and safely I don't have I don't
 
06:06:32.590 --> 06:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
think anyone has actual numbers for the
 
06:06:34.270 --> 06:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
number of election workers in this state
 
06:06:36.830 --> 06:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
that have left but we have seen a sharp
 
06:06:38.948 --> 06:06:38.958 align:start position:0%
rise in in election workers quitting
 
06:06:41.468 --> 06:06:41.478 align:start position:0%
their positions and the need for foam
 
06:06:44.350 --> 06:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
Banks to recruit new election workers I
 
06:06:46.390 --> 06:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
do know in addition that there have been
 
06:06:48.270 --> 06:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
and this kind of may seem like it's two
 
06:06:50.548 --> 06:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
different sides but it's it's two sides
 
06:06:52.468 --> 06:06:52.478 align:start position:0%
of the same coin because anybody who
 
06:06:55.110 --> 06:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
really cares about the electoral process
 
06:06:58.030 --> 06:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
cares both about protecting people who
 
06:07:00.910 --> 06:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
are in most cases volunteering to make
 
06:07:02.910 --> 06:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
sure our elections work but also care
 
06:07:04.750 --> 06:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
about making sure those people do their
 
06:07:06.750 --> 06:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
correct job and don't tamper or
 
06:07:10.628 --> 06:07:10.638 align:start position:0%
influence election results um and so on
 
06:07:12.990 --> 06:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
the other side of that we've seen a few
 
06:07:15.468 --> 06:07:15.478 align:start position:0%
examples across the country and one here
 
06:07:18.788 --> 06:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
at home of uh of both election workers
 
06:07:21.110 --> 06:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
being intimidated but also election
 
06:07:24.830 --> 06:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
workers themselves tampering with um
 
06:07:27.350 --> 06:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
with the process here in in New
 
06:07:30.070 --> 06:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um there was a situation where
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
an election worker in Raymond who was
 
06:07:34.708 --> 06:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
trying to um fix a machine was
 
06:07:34.718 --> 06:07:35.910 align:start position:0%
trying to um fix a machine was
physically

06:07:35.910 --> 06:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
physically
 
06:07:39.390 --> 06:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
assaulted um also across the country uh
 
06:07:42.390 --> 06:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
there have been although not actually in
 
06:07:47.350 --> 06:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but the idea that um that
 
06:07:48.788 --> 06:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
election workers might have been
 
06:07:50.868 --> 06:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
tampering with ballots became an issue
 
06:07:52.910 --> 06:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire a couple years ago and
 
06:07:54.270 --> 06:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
it turned out that it was just as you
 
06:07:56.830 --> 06:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
know um a fold in the ballots but AC
 
06:07:58.948 --> 06:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
Ross the country it did happen that
 
06:08:01.230 --> 06:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
election workers were tampering in
 
06:08:03.708 --> 06:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
famously in Mesa County Colorado as well
 
06:08:05.628 --> 06:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
as Coffee County Georgia where election
 
06:08:08.190 --> 06:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
workers were disclosing the uh
 
06:08:09.990 --> 06:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
proprietary information so that others
 
06:08:13.190 --> 06:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
could hack those systems so we've seen
 
06:08:15.830 --> 06:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
an increase in Need for both protecting
 
06:08:17.548 --> 06:08:17.558 align:start position:0%
election workers as well as protecting
 
06:08:19.430 --> 06:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
the process from perhaps election
 
06:08:22.150 --> 06:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
workers who don't have the best um
 
06:08:24.150 --> 06:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
intentions so I will get into the
 
06:08:27.788 --> 06:08:27.798 align:start position:0%
details of the bill itself
 
06:08:31.628 --> 06:08:31.638 align:start position:0%
so um first paragraph line five we did
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
not include the word retaliation in our
 
06:08:36.708 --> 06:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
current protection language so we added
 
06:08:39.430 --> 06:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
retaliation um as an action that would
 
06:08:41.230 --> 06:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
not be
 
06:08:45.030 --> 06:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
permitted also uh the idea of doxing
 
06:08:47.190 --> 06:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
election workers and just so you know
 
06:08:49.190 --> 06:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
we're we're talking about doxing here it
 
06:08:51.310 --> 06:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
means um disseminating personal
 
06:08:52.750 --> 06:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
information personal information does
 
06:08:56.190 --> 06:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
not include name name is always fair but
 
06:08:57.708 --> 06:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
um personal information is defined on
 
06:09:00.270 --> 06:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
the next page on line eight meaning home
 
06:09:02.910 --> 06:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
address telephone number uh photos of
 
06:09:04.910 --> 06:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
your home photos of your license plates
 
06:09:06.628 --> 06:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things that help people
 
06:09:10.590 --> 06:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
access you personally um that disclosing
 
06:09:13.510 --> 06:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
that as long as in back on the first
 
06:09:15.628 --> 06:09:15.638 align:start position:0%
page the dissemination poses an imminent
 
06:09:16.990 --> 06:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
and serious threat and the person
 
06:09:19.390 --> 06:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
disseminating that information knows
 
06:09:21.468 --> 06:09:21.478 align:start position:0%
that it would pose a serious threat then
 
06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:28.590 --> 06:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
prohibited and then on the second page
 
06:09:33.110 --> 06:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh starting with uh Roman numeral 2 um
 
06:09:35.230 --> 06:09:35.240 align:start position:0%

06:10:03.510 --> 06:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
express permission of Secretary of State
 
06:10:05.070 --> 06:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph five A person shall not KN
 
06:10:07.548 --> 06:10:07.558 align:start position:0%
only publish or cause to be published
 
06:10:09.670 --> 06:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
passwords that would give people access
 
06:10:11.110 --> 06:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
to hack
 
06:10:14.190 --> 06:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
obviously um paragraph six uh well I
 
06:10:16.190 --> 06:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
think that the rest of it just kind of
 
06:10:18.110 --> 06:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh is the the housekeeping to make sure
 
06:10:22.150 --> 06:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
that it is uh enforceable so I think all
 
06:10:24.230 --> 06:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
of these are really reasonable changes
 
06:10:27.310 --> 06:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
to help protect AR election workers also
 
06:10:29.708 --> 06:10:29.718 align:start position:0%
protect our election systems from
 
06:10:31.910 --> 06:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
election workers who don't necessarily
 
06:10:35.910 --> 06:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
have um objective good results uh as
 
06:10:38.350 --> 06:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
their as their motive and I guess with
 
06:10:43.190 --> 06:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:46.990 --> 06:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
questions I will questions from the
 
06:10:49.670 --> 06:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane um thank
 
06:10:52.548 --> 06:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
you um hearkening back to some of the
 
06:10:54.190 --> 06:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
other bills we've heard today there was
 
06:10:56.628 --> 06:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
a distinction between election off
 
06:10:59.990 --> 06:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
officers and election officials so I
 
06:11:03.230 --> 06:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
noticed in the in you know describing
 
06:11:05.310 --> 06:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
the bill it talks about election
 
06:11:09.270 --> 06:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
election officers but then thought I saw
 
06:11:14.468 --> 06:11:14.478 align:start position:0%
election official on the last page um I
 
06:11:17.750 --> 06:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
do say so do you know so our our
 
06:11:20.310 --> 06:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
understanding my understanding was
 
06:11:23.670 --> 06:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
official is the clerk the moderator the
 
06:11:25.948 --> 06:11:25.958 align:start position:0%
supervisor the officers are the
 
06:11:25.958 --> 06:11:27.590 align:start position:0%
supervisor the officers are the
volunteers

06:11:27.590 --> 06:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
06:11:31.390 --> 06:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
so are you bringing everybody under this
 
06:11:32.990 --> 06:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
or are you just trying to keep it to
 
06:11:34.990 --> 06:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
officials everybody should be included
 
06:11:37.270 --> 06:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
in this um because we we were speaking
 
06:11:39.510 --> 06:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
of election workers broadly as leaving
 
06:11:41.990 --> 06:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
their roles and also even if they're a
 
06:11:44.110 --> 06:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
volunteer and not necessarily elected by
 
06:11:45.868 --> 06:11:45.878 align:start position:0%
the town you don't want them tampering
 
06:11:48.468 --> 06:11:48.478 align:start position:0%
with the ballots just kind of plain and
 
06:11:49.948 --> 06:11:49.958 align:start position:0%
simple you don't want anybody doing this
 
06:11:52.830 --> 06:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
stuff um so yeah it should it should
 
06:11:55.070 --> 06:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
cover everyone not you know despite my
 
06:11:57.350 --> 06:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
very first uh request when I was a
 
06:11:59.590 --> 06:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
freshman to be on Election law I ended
 
06:12:03.030 --> 06:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
up on fish and game so I am not um privy
 
06:12:04.708 --> 06:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
to the matters that you have discussed
 
06:12:05.868 --> 06:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
this year in terms of the difference
 
06:12:07.948 --> 06:12:07.958 align:start position:0%
between officers and officials and so if
 
06:12:09.310 --> 06:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment that needs to clean
 
06:12:10.788 --> 06:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
that language up that's fine okay
 
06:12:12.468 --> 06:12:12.478 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:12:12.478 --> 06:12:13.708 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
represent

06:12:13.708 --> 06:12:13.718 align:start position:0%
represent
 
06:12:16.590 --> 06:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
Brennan thank you um I'm noticing the
 
06:12:19.430 --> 06:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
effective date is January 1st 2025 and
 
06:12:22.190 --> 06:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if if there were to be an
 
06:12:25.670 --> 06:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
amendment if you would be open to making
 
06:12:28.190 --> 06:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
this effective sooner so that it would
 
06:12:31.590 --> 06:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
pertain to the November 2024 election I
 
06:12:33.868 --> 06:12:33.878 align:start position:0%
personally would be and would want it to
 
06:12:36.868 --> 06:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
be um effective sooner I think the
 
06:12:39.230 --> 06:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
strategy with going with 2025 had more
 
06:12:41.110 --> 06:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
to do with making sure towns had enough
 
06:12:43.270 --> 06:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
time but I don't know that towns don't
 
06:12:45.708 --> 06:12:45.718 align:start position:0%
have enough time um so as long as say
 
06:12:47.590 --> 06:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association didn't oppose
 
06:12:50.190 --> 06:12:50.200 align:start position:0%
I think that it should be doable great
 
06:12:53.310 --> 06:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative
 
06:12:55.628 --> 06:12:55.638 align:start position:0%
wey thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:13:00.510 --> 06:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question question um on page
 
06:13:04.590 --> 06:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
two um where it says so you're amending
 
06:13:07.150 --> 06:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh 659 42 tampering with electronic
 
06:13:10.350 --> 06:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
ballot counting devices but then it
 
06:13:14.110 --> 06:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
looks like paragraphs Roman numeral 2
 
06:13:17.788 --> 06:13:17.798 align:start position:0%
three four and five are
 
06:13:20.548 --> 06:13:20.558 align:start position:0%
not or at least some of some of the
 
06:13:22.670 --> 06:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
aspects of this may not
 
06:13:25.628 --> 06:13:25.638 align:start position:0%
be pertaining to the ballot counting
 
06:13:30.390 --> 06:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
devices so so paragraph three uh
 
06:13:32.910 --> 06:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter registration system so
 
06:13:35.750 --> 06:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's it it's seems like
 
06:13:39.990 --> 06:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's um the scope is beyond the title of
 
06:13:43.310 --> 06:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
the paragraph and so I think that might
 
06:13:46.670 --> 06:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
need to be amended and um followup if I
 
06:13:50.830 --> 06:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
may yep um and do you think that this
 
06:13:53.830 --> 06:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
would have any impact
 
06:13:58.468 --> 06:13:58.478 align:start position:0%
on um is you we talked earlier today
 
06:14:01.788 --> 06:14:01.798 align:start position:0%
about uh wrongful voting and voter fraud
 
06:14:03.430 --> 06:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
you think this would have any impact on
 
06:14:05.830 --> 06:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
a whistleblower who might have
 
06:14:07.150 --> 06:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
discovered an
 
06:14:09.990 --> 06:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
issue and wants to report it but but
 
06:14:11.628 --> 06:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
then could
 
06:14:15.990 --> 06:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
be themselves suppressed or intimidated
 
06:14:18.150 --> 06:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
by oh I'm you know if if I bring this
 
06:14:21.230 --> 06:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
forward I'm going to accuse you of these
 
06:14:23.590 --> 06:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
of intimidating me and that sort of
 
06:14:25.390 --> 06:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
thing so I'm just curious as to your
 
06:14:26.910 --> 06:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that well to be clear
 
06:14:28.788 --> 06:14:28.798 align:start position:0%
intimidation is already covered we
 
06:14:30.510 --> 06:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
already prohibit intimidation threaten
 
06:14:32.190 --> 06:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
of force violence or any tactical
 
06:14:33.830 --> 06:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
coercion or intimidation to noing
 
06:14:35.910 --> 06:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
discourages interfere so that's already
 
06:14:38.948 --> 06:14:38.958 align:start position:0%
in our laws so um no I don't think it
 
06:14:41.310 --> 06:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
would discourage a whistleblower so long
 
06:14:44.468 --> 06:14:44.478 align:start position:0%
as the Whistleblower was not um doxing
 
06:14:47.030 --> 06:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
them that's the only like real
 
06:14:48.510 --> 06:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
retaliation and doxing are the only
 
06:14:50.270 --> 06:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
things that are being added here so if
 
06:14:51.590 --> 06:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's just falling under the general
 
06:14:53.590 --> 06:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
category of intimidation then that's
 
06:14:55.628 --> 06:14:55.638 align:start position:0%
currently the the issue the currently
 
06:14:57.510 --> 06:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
the case intimidation is
 
06:14:59.628 --> 06:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
prohibited okay further questions from
 
06:15:02.150 --> 06:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
06:15:04.548 --> 06:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
Ward thank you Mr chair thank you
 
06:15:05.948 --> 06:15:05.958 align:start position:0%
representative we're taking my question
 
06:15:08.628 --> 06:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
on page three on line two could you just
 
06:15:12.230 --> 06:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
Define that for
 
06:15:16.310 --> 06:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
me you're asking for disclosure programs
 
06:15:19.310 --> 06:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
and Bug Bounty programs yeah what is
 
06:15:22.670 --> 06:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
that well a bug Bounty program would be
 
06:15:26.310 --> 06:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
um if somebody were offering a bounty to
 
06:15:28.548 --> 06:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
kind of look at the programming and see
 
06:15:31.910 --> 06:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
if there's an issue as I understand
 
06:15:36.310 --> 06:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
it hack for representive qu thank you Mr
 
06:15:38.150 --> 06:15:38.160 align:start position:0%

through
 
06:15:46.868 --> 06:15:46.878 align:start position:0%

06:15:48.708 --> 06:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
a Class A misdemeanor if he or she
 
06:15:50.390 --> 06:15:50.400 align:start position:0%

an election official

if the dissemination pauses an imminent

and the serious threat to the safety and
 
06:16:04.430 --> 06:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
the person making the information knows
 
06:16:06.150 --> 06:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
or reasonably should know of any
 
06:16:09.190 --> 06:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
imminent and serious threat I have a
 
06:16:10.510 --> 06:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
similar question the one I had
 
06:16:12.230 --> 06:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
previously what's the standard of proof
 
06:16:14.030 --> 06:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
for stating that someone should have
 
06:16:14.040 --> 06:16:14.948 align:start position:0%
for stating that someone should have
known

06:16:14.948 --> 06:16:14.958 align:start position:0%
known
 
06:16:14.958 --> 06:16:18.990 align:start position:0%
known
that

06:16:18.990 --> 06:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:21.230 --> 06:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
and I'll stay with a and if I can have a
 
06:16:24.270 --> 06:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
followup I'd appreciate it so I'm I'm
 
06:16:26.670 --> 06:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sure that um
 
06:16:28.468 --> 06:16:28.478 align:start position:0%
our friends on criminal justice would
 
06:16:30.548 --> 06:16:30.558 align:start position:0%
enjoy having this conversation because
 
06:16:32.628 --> 06:16:32.638 align:start position:0%
there are many different um criminal
 
06:16:35.150 --> 06:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
acts where your culpability level so
 
06:16:36.628 --> 06:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of out of Criminal
 
06:16:38.350 --> 06:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
Justice there's typically four
 
06:16:40.788 --> 06:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
culpability States for criminal law that
 
06:16:43.948 --> 06:16:43.958 align:start position:0%
is purposefully knowingly careless
 
06:16:45.948 --> 06:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
recklessly and carelessly carelessly and
 
06:16:48.310 --> 06:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
recklessly and all of those depend on
 
06:16:50.430 --> 06:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
basically what your mental state was
 
06:16:52.190 --> 06:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
right did you intend to do it and so all
 
06:16:54.350 --> 06:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
of that has to be proven in court and
 
06:16:56.628 --> 06:16:56.638 align:start position:0%
prosecutors usually will Pro Ute at the
 
06:16:58.788 --> 06:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
lowest level they think they can prove
 
06:17:00.510 --> 06:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
but things that you may have written
 
06:17:02.788 --> 06:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
online things that you have said to
 
06:17:04.948 --> 06:17:04.958 align:start position:0%
people information you had that you
 
06:17:07.350 --> 06:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
clearly had access to or that people
 
06:17:09.830 --> 06:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
know that you saw or know that you heard
 
06:17:12.150 --> 06:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
those types of things go to prove what
 
06:17:13.910 --> 06:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
you were aware of and therefore what
 
06:17:15.868 --> 06:17:15.878 align:start position:0%
you're mentally culpable
 
06:17:18.948 --> 06:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
of thank you followup a followup and
 
06:17:22.510 --> 06:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
this uh has two closely related aspects
 
06:17:22.520 --> 06:17:23.270 align:start position:0%
this uh has two closely related aspects
to

06:17:23.270 --> 06:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:17:27.350 --> 06:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
it uh you define personal
 
06:17:29.948 --> 06:17:29.958 align:start position:0%
information as including a person's home
 
06:17:31.868 --> 06:17:31.878 align:start position:0%
address that's the part I'm particularly
 
06:17:36.390 --> 06:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
interested in uh at the moment there are
 
06:17:40.230 --> 06:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
two in my opinion two
 
06:17:43.190 --> 06:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
important uh areas occasions where that
 
06:17:45.310 --> 06:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
information is revealed publicly
 
06:17:48.230 --> 06:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
routinely one has to do with in my town
 
06:17:51.990 --> 06:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
at least the annual report has a list of
 
06:17:54.868 --> 06:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
properties that are taxed or have uh
 
06:17:58.070 --> 06:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
other information uh related to them
 
06:18:01.110 --> 06:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
like uh was it concurrent use anyway we
 
06:18:04.190 --> 06:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
have a you have a uh an exemption for
 
06:18:04.200 --> 06:18:05.070 align:start position:0%
have a you have a uh an exemption for
certain

06:18:05.070 --> 06:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
certain
 
06:18:08.868 --> 06:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
uses all right uh that is important for
 
06:18:10.910 --> 06:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
public transparency in term of everybody
 
06:18:12.910 --> 06:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
in my opinion and that of others
 
06:18:14.948 --> 06:18:14.958 align:start position:0%
believes that the list of those who are
 
06:18:16.910 --> 06:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
taxed should be publicly available so
 
06:18:18.468 --> 06:18:18.478 align:start position:0%
everybody can see for themselves that
 
06:18:21.030 --> 06:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's being done in a fair manner a
 
06:18:23.910 --> 06:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
second uh example of that I believe is
 
06:18:25.670 --> 06:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
the voter roles where we've already
 
06:18:27.468 --> 06:18:27.478 align:start position:0%
heard at least once today that it's
 
06:18:29.430 --> 06:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
important that the voter roles which
 
06:18:32.548 --> 06:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
typically include name and address at
 
06:18:34.788 --> 06:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
the very least are made public in a
 
06:18:37.150 --> 06:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
routine basis it's accessible to
 
06:18:39.310 --> 06:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
everybody U I can think of one further
 
06:18:41.590 --> 06:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
related example where there are some
 
06:18:45.788 --> 06:18:45.798 align:start position:0%
entities that uh create their their own
 
06:18:47.590 --> 06:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
list of Voters with additional
 
06:18:49.948 --> 06:18:49.958 align:start position:0%
information additional data fields
 
06:18:51.990 --> 06:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
they've generated themselves and it can
 
06:18:54.310 --> 06:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
include information such as phone
 
06:18:56.590 --> 06:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
numbers and uh mobile phones I've seen
 
06:18:59.270 --> 06:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
such list
 
06:19:03.510 --> 06:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
routinely so uh I don't see how
 
06:19:06.310 --> 06:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
practical it is or even how desirable it
 
06:19:09.868 --> 06:19:09.878 align:start position:0%
would be to exclude certain voters from
 
06:19:12.510 --> 06:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
the voter roles publicly available voter
 
06:19:16.070 --> 06:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
roles or certain tax certain Property
 
06:19:18.270 --> 06:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
Owners from the list of property owners
 
06:19:21.350 --> 06:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
so that seems to me to conflict with
 
06:19:23.590 --> 06:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
your the statement in your bill so how
 
06:19:25.708 --> 06:19:25.718 align:start position:0%
would you resolve that for me sure thank
 
06:19:28.468 --> 06:19:28.478 align:start position:0%
you you so the the two the third example
 
06:19:31.868 --> 06:19:31.878 align:start position:0%
you gave is a privately created list and
 
06:19:33.868 --> 06:19:33.878 align:start position:0%
we can't really prevent people from
 
06:19:35.830 --> 06:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
creating lists privately but I want to
 
06:19:37.468 --> 06:19:37.478 align:start position:0%
the first thing I need to address is
 
06:19:41.548 --> 06:19:41.558 align:start position:0%
that nothing in this prevents or makes
 
06:19:44.708 --> 06:19:44.718 align:start position:0%
secret the name right you they can
 
06:19:46.430 --> 06:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
always disclose the name we should know
 
06:19:48.868 --> 06:19:48.878 align:start position:0%
the names of the election workers with
 
06:19:51.548 --> 06:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
the other two examples you gave property
 
06:19:54.030 --> 06:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
tax maps which obviously you know the
 
06:19:55.430 --> 06:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
home address because it's the property
 
06:19:58.150 --> 06:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
tax and also the voter role which you
 
06:19:59.510 --> 06:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
have to know the address because you
 
06:20:00.430 --> 06:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
have to know whether or not they're
 
06:20:02.910 --> 06:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
qualified to vote both of those require
 
06:20:05.070 --> 06:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
inherently in the definition of those
 
06:20:08.230 --> 06:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
lists require the address so we already
 
06:20:10.270 --> 06:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
we're already saying the name is fine
 
06:20:11.948 --> 06:20:11.958 align:start position:0%
the question is is there any reason we
 
06:20:13.548 --> 06:20:13.558 align:start position:0%
need to know the address of election
 
06:20:15.350 --> 06:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
workers if you're not trying to hurt
 
06:20:17.190 --> 06:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
them or intimidate them or retaliate
 
06:20:20.230 --> 06:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
against them there's I can't think of a
 
06:20:21.910 --> 06:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
reason why you'd have to know the home
 
06:20:24.750 --> 06:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
address of an election worker separately
 
06:20:26.270 --> 06:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
I didn't I kind of skipped over and in
 
06:20:28.868 --> 06:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
my introduction but the 1B here right
 
06:20:31.350 --> 06:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
afterwards is it's up really up to the
 
06:20:33.310 --> 06:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
election worker the election worker is
 
06:20:35.190 --> 06:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
the one that submits a request saying
 
06:20:36.750 --> 06:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
that they don't want their home address
 
06:20:39.030 --> 06:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
to be public so it's not automatic that
 
06:20:40.830 --> 06:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
it's not public it's the election worker
 
06:20:43.670 --> 06:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
can choose that protection to allow for
 
06:20:46.230 --> 06:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
their home address to be um private
 
06:20:48.708 --> 06:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
information um and again it's it's not
 
06:20:51.430 --> 06:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
name it's just home address license
 
06:20:53.510 --> 06:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
plate pictures things like
 
06:20:55.910 --> 06:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
that okay qu further question on the
 
06:20:57.708 --> 06:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you
 
06:21:09.150 --> 06:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:12.590 --> 06:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
zinc good afternoon um Olivia zinc
 
06:21:14.430 --> 06:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
executive director with open democracy a
 
06:21:17.270 --> 06:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan organization um I think that
 
06:21:19.670 --> 06:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's really important to look at this um
 
06:21:23.868 --> 06:21:23.878 align:start position:0%
from an intimidation perspective of um
 
06:21:26.230 --> 06:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
the voter the woman that the woman who
 
06:21:28.190 --> 06:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
voted in in Raymond at the last town
 
06:21:29.750 --> 06:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
meeting whose
 
06:21:33.070 --> 06:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
ballot um jammed and instead of having a
 
06:21:35.788 --> 06:21:35.798 align:start position:0%
reasonable conversation with the
 
06:21:37.628 --> 06:21:37.638 align:start position:0%
moderator they assaulted them they
 
06:21:39.070 --> 06:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
punched them in the face right they were
 
06:21:41.788 --> 06:21:41.798 align:start position:0%
arrested they were charged this is this
 
06:21:45.070 --> 06:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
is what we're seeing at elections um
 
06:21:46.830 --> 06:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
maybe it's just Raymond maybe there's
 
06:21:48.708 --> 06:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
some other towns you may have heard of
 
06:21:52.430 --> 06:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
these examples where um election workers
 
06:21:56.310 --> 06:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
are being physically harmed I have been
 
06:21:58.350 --> 06:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
in in polling places where moderators
 
06:22:00.548 --> 06:22:00.558 align:start position:0%
have been yelled at because people were
 
06:22:01.868 --> 06:22:01.878 align:start position:0%
registered the wrong party and they
 
06:22:04.390 --> 06:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that right we have
 
06:22:08.270 --> 06:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
seen um people the I think just the tone
 
06:22:11.910 --> 06:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
and rhetoric right now is really high
 
06:22:13.948 --> 06:22:13.958 align:start position:0%
and and I think that many people are not
 
06:22:16.030 --> 06:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
wanting to be pole workers because
 
06:22:19.708 --> 06:22:19.718 align:start position:0%
they're afraid of intimidation and this
 
06:22:22.868 --> 06:22:22.878 align:start position:0%
would just put some Protections in um to
 
06:22:26.430 --> 06:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that there is um additional
 
06:22:28.948 --> 06:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
protections for these charges and and
 
06:22:30.468 --> 06:22:30.478 align:start position:0%
again the person that was assaulted in
 
06:22:32.910 --> 06:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
Raymond were charged and was elevated
 
06:22:36.110 --> 06:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
because it was a civil servant um but I
 
06:22:38.230 --> 06:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
think it's it's important that we look
 
06:22:41.548 --> 06:22:41.558 align:start position:0%
at these um just this past November um
 
06:22:43.510 --> 06:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
in Washington Oregon California Nevada
 
06:22:46.030 --> 06:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
Georgia envelopes of white powdered were
 
06:22:47.868 --> 06:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
sent to home addresses of election
 
06:22:51.548 --> 06:22:51.558 align:start position:0%
workers it was fentol in four cases um
 
06:22:54.270 --> 06:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
this is what we see when election
 
06:22:57.510 --> 06:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
workers um we mean doxing where their
 
06:23:00.030 --> 06:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
name is published and you tell people to
 
06:23:02.830 --> 06:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
do bad things and I think the Windam
 
06:23:06.390 --> 06:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
toown clerk may have uh had some of that
 
06:23:08.910 --> 06:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
after the 2020 election and so I think
 
06:23:11.110 --> 06:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
it's important that we put these
 
06:23:13.948 --> 06:23:13.958 align:start position:0%
protections um on our election workers
 
06:23:16.750 --> 06:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
to ensure that
 
06:23:19.350 --> 06:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
um uh we are
 
06:23:23.230 --> 06:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
are really addressing the retoric and um
 
06:23:26.110 --> 06:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're protecting uh the
 
06:23:27.708 --> 06:23:27.718 align:start position:0%
civil servants that are doing the work
 
06:23:31.350 --> 06:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
of of executing elections every day and
 
06:23:33.628 --> 06:23:33.638 align:start position:0%
I I remember one committee meeting where
 
06:23:35.708 --> 06:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
somebody threatened and intimidated you
 
06:23:37.910 --> 06:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
all as committee members right so you
 
06:23:41.270 --> 06:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
you've all witnessed that too
 
06:23:45.708 --> 06:23:45.718 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I I I I know that they sort of
 
06:23:47.750 --> 06:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Kathleen pruto mbri
 
06:23:49.788 --> 06:23:49.798 align:start position:0%
and I remember they they kind
 
06:23:51.990 --> 06:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
of yeah we're looking at you yeah when
 
06:23:54.948 --> 06:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
they said that and it was I was I was in
 
06:23:56.750 --> 06:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
the back of the room saying this is not
 
06:23:58.230 --> 06:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate behavior in a Committee
 
06:24:01.548 --> 06:24:01.558 align:start position:0%
hearing um for people to intimidate the
 
06:24:03.590 --> 06:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
committee so I I we know that this
 
06:24:05.070 --> 06:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
Behavior exists and I think it's
 
06:24:08.910 --> 06:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
important for us to um stay safe um and
 
06:24:11.628 --> 06:24:11.638 align:start position:0%
so I hope you will consider this
 
06:24:14.430 --> 06:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
bill okay questions from the committee
 
06:24:17.708 --> 06:24:17.718 align:start position:0%
representative B Bay I saw I saw first I
 
06:24:20.910 --> 06:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
saw first brother I I do I you know it's
 
06:24:23.070 --> 06:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
the only time I go left first
 
06:24:27.670 --> 06:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr care person um so you're
 
06:24:29.270 --> 06:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
talk this this bill is to protect
 
06:24:31.590 --> 06:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
election um workers from I guess uh
 
06:24:35.150 --> 06:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
disgruntled voters and uh does that
 
06:24:37.628 --> 06:24:37.638 align:start position:0%
include voters who are
 
06:24:39.990 --> 06:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
also um
 
06:24:43.510 --> 06:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
candidates this scrun candidates I mean
 
06:24:48.430 --> 06:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
I think I should ask the sponsor but um
 
06:24:49.830 --> 06:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
does this discover
 
06:24:54.030 --> 06:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
that I I I um I'm just going to say that
 
06:24:56.110 --> 06:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
in the voter confidence commission
 
06:24:59.070 --> 06:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
report um there was protections for
 
06:25:01.390 --> 06:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
election workers and for voters so it
 
06:25:03.628 --> 06:25:03.638 align:start position:0%
went both ways that we should have civil
 
06:25:05.910 --> 06:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
discourse at the polls um and I think
 
06:25:07.910 --> 06:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
that uh if you look back at the voter
 
06:25:11.708 --> 06:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
confidence report um that uh those
 
06:25:14.150 --> 06:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations were in
 
06:25:17.310 --> 06:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
there okay now representative wood thank
 
06:25:19.390 --> 06:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:25:21.628 --> 06:25:21.638 align:start position:0%
question it seems like everything that's
 
06:25:24.230 --> 06:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
being addressed in this bill is already
 
06:25:27.310 --> 06:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
against the law or easily covered by
 
06:25:30.948 --> 06:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
what we already have in place um can you
 
06:25:33.708 --> 06:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
show me a something that this is doing
 
06:25:37.390 --> 06:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
that current law isn't doing I I think
 
06:25:38.910 --> 06:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
you're right that there are criminals I
 
06:25:40.910 --> 06:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
mean if you punch somebody in the face
 
06:25:43.990 --> 06:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
there that's illegal um but I but I
 
06:25:46.708 --> 06:25:46.718 align:start position:0%
think it does add a
 
06:25:46.718 --> 06:25:48.310 align:start position:0%
think it does add a
retaliation

06:25:48.310 --> 06:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
retaliation
 
06:25:50.788 --> 06:25:50.798 align:start position:0%
um because if somebody thinks you've
 
06:25:53.390 --> 06:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
done something wrong that retaliation is
 
06:25:56.070 --> 06:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
added but the threaten the the um
 
06:25:58.948 --> 06:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
threatening is already in there yeah I
 
06:26:00.628 --> 06:26:00.638 align:start position:0%
that a question followup please uh we'll
 
06:26:01.868 --> 06:26:01.878 align:start position:0%
see if anybody else wants to go first
 
06:26:03.590 --> 06:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
and then yes all right nobody else wants
 
06:26:06.510 --> 06:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
to go so you're out so H um I sure
 
06:26:09.030 --> 06:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
you've been in a voting environment as a
 
06:26:13.230 --> 06:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
voter I can say it goes both ways uh the
 
06:26:16.468 --> 06:26:16.478 align:start position:0%
um level of intimidation goes both ways
 
06:26:18.230 --> 06:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of energy in there
 
06:26:20.868 --> 06:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
someone wears a political shirt uh the
 
06:26:22.628 --> 06:26:22.638 align:start position:0%
way they handle that person they could
 
06:26:24.948 --> 06:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
handle better in my opinion so all I'm
 
06:26:26.788 --> 06:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
saying is it almost seems like we're
 
06:26:29.310 --> 06:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
we're forming this special class of
 
06:26:31.270 --> 06:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
servants and we're all subject as you
 
06:26:34.468 --> 06:26:34.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned we're all subject to it uh
 
06:26:37.110 --> 06:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
this is part of the job unfortunately
 
06:26:39.750 --> 06:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
and the state running a State and State
 
06:26:41.190 --> 06:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
office isn't that much different than
 
06:26:43.628 --> 06:26:43.638 align:start position:0%
running in a town office when you have
 
06:26:45.990 --> 06:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
to deal with the your the public the
 
06:26:48.430 --> 06:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
constituent so I just think that this
 
06:26:51.468 --> 06:26:51.478 align:start position:0%
this you know it's a it's a interesting
 
06:26:53.910 --> 06:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
bill but I I think it's already covered
 
06:26:58.430 --> 06:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
why why why why add more another layer
 
06:27:01.708 --> 06:27:01.718 align:start position:0%
to it that's my question sorry for the
 
06:27:03.628 --> 06:27:03.638 align:start position:0%
uh no I I think you're you're right that
 
06:27:06.708 --> 06:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
there are some statutory protections um
 
06:27:09.190 --> 06:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
I think this just elevates some of them
 
06:27:10.868 --> 06:27:10.878 align:start position:0%
knowing how important election workers
 
06:27:13.350 --> 06:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
are but I think you're right I have I
 
06:27:14.788 --> 06:27:14.798 align:start position:0%
have been in the polling place I have
 
06:27:16.948 --> 06:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
served as an election worker for the
 
06:27:20.190 --> 06:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
last I don't know nine years and and I
 
06:27:23.070 --> 06:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
think I remember nine years ago not
 
06:27:25.350 --> 06:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
seeing the level of intensity that we
 
06:27:27.110 --> 06:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
have people were much more polite to
 
06:27:29.270 --> 06:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
each other it was a celebration people
 
06:27:32.390 --> 06:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
were working together um and then you
 
06:27:35.230 --> 06:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
saw some more intensity grow and and
 
06:27:36.670 --> 06:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
you're right you know the voter in
 
06:27:37.948 --> 06:27:37.958 align:start position:0%
exiter who took off their shirt and
 
06:27:40.350 --> 06:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
voted with topless like these things
 
06:27:43.628 --> 06:27:43.638 align:start position:0%
happen but you know people don't want to
 
06:27:44.990 --> 06:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
remove a clothing because they think
 
06:27:46.230 --> 06:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
they have a First Amendment right to
 
06:27:48.190 --> 06:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
wear it but but there are we are trying
 
06:27:51.190 --> 06:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
to keep the polling place sort of free
 
06:27:54.030 --> 06:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
of that kind of
 
06:27:59.510 --> 06:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
hostility representative BR thank you um
 
06:28:01.510 --> 06:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
do election officials have a
 
06:28:05.708 --> 06:28:05.718 align:start position:0%
responsibility in their role to inform a
 
06:28:10.270 --> 06:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
voter if they are wearing um
 
06:28:14.270 --> 06:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
electioneering hats buttons shirts don't
 
06:28:16.390 --> 06:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
they have a responsibility to let that
 
06:28:19.590 --> 06:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
voter know and then if that voter
 
06:28:21.910 --> 06:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
responds in a way that might be
 
06:28:24.230 --> 06:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
threatening or retaliating for that
 
06:28:26.708 --> 06:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
election official doing their
 
06:28:30.230 --> 06:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
job wouldn't this bill kind of address
 
06:28:31.990 --> 06:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
that type of
 
06:28:34.910 --> 06:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
situation it could and I think that when
 
06:28:37.190 --> 06:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
we uh I think the secretary of state did
 
06:28:39.628 --> 06:28:39.638 align:start position:0%
trainings on deescalate Conflict at the
 
06:28:42.350 --> 06:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
polling place for the first time uh in
 
06:28:43.590 --> 06:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
the leadup to the
 
06:28:47.230 --> 06:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
2022 um elections so I I think when you
 
06:28:49.830 --> 06:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
we think about how um we're training
 
06:28:51.548 --> 06:28:51.558 align:start position:0%
election workers to deescalate that
 
06:28:53.430 --> 06:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
conflict I think it's it's important for
 
06:28:56.070 --> 06:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
us to remember you
 
06:29:00.390 --> 06:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
know to me if my ballot ever got jammed
 
06:29:03.468 --> 06:29:03.478 align:start position:0%
in a machine you know I would understand
 
06:29:05.910 --> 06:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
that you know there's other Solutions
 
06:29:07.670 --> 06:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
than punching the moderator in the face
 
06:29:09.548 --> 06:29:09.558 align:start position:0%
but some people's level of anger and
 
06:29:12.270 --> 06:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
hate are are up there and and we see
 
06:29:14.270 --> 06:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
these activities happening and I think
 
06:29:16.510 --> 06:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
this addresses that further questions
 
06:29:18.510 --> 06:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank you
 
06:29:21.390 --> 06:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
so much a last up is Dan
 
06:29:32.910 --> 06:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:35.510 --> 06:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
hi uh Dan Hy Nash city clerk uh
 
06:29:37.350 --> 06:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire City and town
 
06:29:40.430 --> 06:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
clerks Association uh so the only thing
 
06:29:43.868 --> 06:29:43.878 align:start position:0%
um I'm up here really to discuss is uh
 
06:29:46.670 --> 06:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
Section 8 where it says the designated
 
06:29:48.590 --> 06:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
election official shall keep all
 
06:29:50.270 --> 06:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
components of a voting system in a
 
06:29:51.830 --> 06:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
location where entry is controlled by
 
06:29:54.430 --> 06:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
the use of a key card access or other
 
06:29:54.440 --> 06:29:55.430 align:start position:0%
the use of a key card access or other
SIM

06:29:55.430 --> 06:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
SIM
 
06:29:58.468 --> 06:29:58.478 align:start position:0%
similar automatic entry logging system
 
06:30:00.390 --> 06:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
Ian shall ensure that the log created by
 
06:30:02.390 --> 06:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
the system is maintained as an election
 
06:30:04.990 --> 06:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
record for 25 months following the date
 
06:30:07.708 --> 06:30:07.718 align:start position:0%
of any entry So currently in nationville
 
06:30:10.990 --> 06:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
we have a uh locked Vault it's not key
 
06:30:14.030 --> 06:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
card and that's where our um voting
 
06:30:17.070 --> 06:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
systems are stored uh the tabulators so
 
06:30:18.868 --> 06:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
we do a combination to get in there it's
 
06:30:21.070 --> 06:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
only city clerk staff that have access
 
06:30:23.270 --> 06:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's locked up at the end of the day it
 
06:30:26.030 --> 06:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
is open during the day when staff is
 
06:30:30.548 --> 06:30:30.558 align:start position:0%
present in um monitoring that location
 
06:30:32.788 --> 06:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
we could move the devices to another
 
06:30:36.150 --> 06:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
location that you know we don't go into
 
06:30:38.430 --> 06:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
as frequently it wouldn't be a key card
 
06:30:42.230 --> 06:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
access I see the key card um component
 
06:30:43.910 --> 06:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
being an issue for a lot of
 
06:30:47.310 --> 06:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities to to have that um in
 
06:30:50.948 --> 06:30:50.958 align:start position:0%
addition the uh tabulators have a um
 
06:30:54.230 --> 06:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
activity log book and it states uh at
 
06:30:57.190 --> 06:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
the front of it which members of the
 
06:31:00.670 --> 06:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
clerk's office have access to these bags
 
06:31:02.230 --> 06:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
so if we have to keep track of every
 
06:31:03.990 --> 06:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
time we go in and out of our vault it's
 
06:31:09.510 --> 06:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
the list is going to be huge um so this
 
06:31:09.520 --> 06:31:10.548 align:start position:0%
the list is going to be huge um so this
uh

06:31:10.548 --> 06:31:10.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:31:13.190 --> 06:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
section8 uh I'd like to see it changed
 
06:31:14.548 --> 06:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
to maybe the designated election
 
06:31:16.190 --> 06:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
official shall keep all components of
 
06:31:18.030 --> 06:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
voting system in a location where entry
 
06:31:19.948 --> 06:31:19.958 align:start position:0%
is controlled by use of a key card
 
06:31:25.468 --> 06:31:25.478 align:start position:0%
access or lock and I'm not sure on
 
06:31:27.388 --> 06:31:27.398 align:start position:0%
making a record every time someone goes
 
06:31:30.388 --> 06:31:30.398 align:start position:0%
into that locked area uh you have to
 
06:31:33.590 --> 06:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
create then a separate spot for these um
 
06:31:35.830 --> 06:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
voting systems because we're in and out
 
06:31:37.510 --> 06:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
of rev Vault all day
 
06:31:39.510 --> 06:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
long okay questions from the committee
 
06:31:42.310 --> 06:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you um
 
06:31:45.190 --> 06:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
would removing that section entirely
 
06:31:47.628 --> 06:31:47.638 align:start position:0%

parliamentary okay it actually is uh
 
06:46:04.388 --> 06:46:04.398 align:start position:0%
assuming if it goes the way you said
 
06:46:05.990 --> 06:46:06.000 align:start position:0%

06:46:14.788 --> 06:46:14.798 align:start position:0%
y um okay um all right is there
 
06:46:17.230 --> 06:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion of inexpedient
 
06:46:21.030 --> 06:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
to legislate yes I like to make I mean I
 
06:46:25.030 --> 06:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
made the motion itl reason being is one
 
06:46:27.388 --> 06:46:27.398 align:start position:0%
of the problems that I see this
 
06:46:31.590 --> 06:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
causing is if for example the bill says
 
06:46:34.628 --> 06:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
that the redistricting has it done by
 
06:46:36.910 --> 06:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature which is
 
06:46:41.030 --> 06:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
fine uh does not listen to the
 
06:46:43.750 --> 06:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
commission which it can it gives the
 
06:46:47.548 --> 06:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
governor which another excuse to veto a
 
06:46:51.830 --> 06:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
bill veto the bill and I have a problem
 
06:46:54.430 --> 06:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
with the governor even having and say
 
06:46:56.270 --> 06:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
with the redistricting and I think that
 
06:46:59.270 --> 06:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed so I think we need to
 
06:47:01.110 --> 06:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
other things that need to be fixed and
 
06:47:05.310 --> 06:47:05.320 align:start position:0%
we have 10 years to do it is not this
 
06:47:09.670 --> 06:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
way not this way is let's you know fix
 
06:47:10.868 --> 06:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
the county
 
06:47:14.628 --> 06:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
system uh get the governor out of it but
 
06:47:17.350 --> 06:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
the redistricting commission like I said
 
06:47:20.548 --> 06:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
on a floor speech some years ago in
 
06:47:25.110 --> 06:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
charge so in the the 16 years that I've
 
06:47:28.388 --> 06:47:28.398 align:start position:0%
been in the legislature I probably eight
 
06:47:31.830 --> 06:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
of those years has been the opposite so
 
06:47:34.990 --> 06:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
I mean we go back and forth all the time
 
06:47:37.350 --> 06:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
so and and in the senate in the
 
06:47:40.190 --> 06:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
executive Council in the governor so you
 
06:47:42.788 --> 06:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
know so I don't see a problem with our
 
06:47:42.798 --> 06:47:43.910 align:start position:0%
know so I don't see a problem with our
current

06:47:43.910 --> 06:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
current
 
06:47:46.670 --> 06:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
redistricting thank you further uh
 
06:47:50.230 --> 06:47:50.240 align:start position:0%

06:50:51.468 --> 06:50:51.478 align:start position:0%
so you're in the middle of making a
 
06:50:53.270 --> 06:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
motion I made the motion all right is
 
06:50:54.150 --> 06:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
there a
 
06:50:57.110 --> 06:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
second I'll second representative Hamlet
 
06:50:59.350 --> 06:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
second we are now on discussion of
 
06:50:59.360 --> 06:51:00.830 align:start position:0%
second we are now on discussion of
amendment

06:51:00.830 --> 06:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:51:00.840 --> 06:51:02.350 align:start position:0%
amendment
2024

06:51:02.350 --> 06:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
2024
 
06:51:09.788 --> 06:51:09.798 align:start position:0%
d513 H um to House Bill 1426 FN is there
 
06:51:10.910 --> 06:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment
 
06:51:12.910 --> 06:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lane is recognized um
 
06:51:16.190 --> 06:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um so this makes two changes
 
06:51:18.750 --> 06:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
that were requested during um the
 
06:51:21.270 --> 06:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
testimony and were brought to my attent
 
06:51:23.868 --> 06:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
attention is um U basically typos the
 
06:51:27.670 --> 06:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
first one on page um on on line six
 
06:51:31.708 --> 06:51:31.718 align:start position:0%
where the word zero is was one before it
 
06:51:35.868 --> 06:51:35.878 align:start position:0%
was indic so basically it has to do in a
 
06:51:38.350 --> 06:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
year ending in zero and rather than a
 
06:51:40.030 --> 06:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
year ending in one because it didn't
 
06:51:42.468 --> 06:51:42.478 align:start position:0%
make sense The Way It Was Written and
 
06:51:46.388 --> 06:51:46.398 align:start position:0%
then the par the uh last clause on line
 
06:51:50.070 --> 06:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
14 provided that such subsequent map
 
06:51:51.948 --> 06:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
shall be adopted pursuant to the
 
06:51:54.270 --> 06:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
procedur set forth in this chapter was
 
06:51:57.788 --> 06:51:57.798 align:start position:0%
added because someone asked me if it was
 
06:52:00.430 --> 06:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
clear that if we have to start over that
 
06:52:03.230 --> 06:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
it's under this particular statute and I
 
06:52:05.628 --> 06:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
said yes that's the intent so that's why
 
06:52:08.670 --> 06:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
I added that language okay I can take
 
06:52:10.708 --> 06:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
any questions my understanding
 
06:52:12.270 --> 06:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
representative Lane is this is purely
 
06:52:15.628 --> 06:52:15.638 align:start position:0%
housekeeping correct for that's the
 
06:52:17.830 --> 06:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
intent yes okay so it is my intention to
 
06:52:19.430 --> 06:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of this amendment even
 
06:52:21.190 --> 06:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
though I just voted against the bill I
 
06:52:22.230 --> 06:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to establish in this
 
06:52:24.948 --> 06:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
committee the president of voting down
 
06:52:26.670 --> 06:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
good faith housekeeping amendments even
 
06:52:28.388 --> 06:52:28.398 align:start position:0%
when we happen to disagree so I will be
 
06:52:34.310 --> 06:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:36.670 --> 06:52:36.680 align:start position:0%

as

06:53:56.230 --> 06:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:58.150 --> 06:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
amended representative Lane you
 
06:54:00.708 --> 06:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
recognized so I I apologize folks but
 
06:54:02.750 --> 06:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
since I missed the hearing I just wanted
 
06:54:04.990 --> 06:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
to address some of the questions that
 
06:54:08.110 --> 06:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
did come up and I mostly I think that
 
06:54:09.868 --> 06:54:09.878 align:start position:0%
this is a way to make
 
06:54:13.868 --> 06:54:13.878 align:start position:0%
our our system more transparent and more
 
06:54:17.910 --> 06:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
fair and I think uh representative mure
 
06:54:19.430 --> 06:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
had indicated none of us knows who's
 
06:54:22.990 --> 06:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
going control control this in 2030 so
 
06:54:25.670 --> 06:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
the idea is to make it as Fair as we can
 
06:54:28.468 --> 06:54:28.478 align:start position:0%
and as transparent as we can I looked at
 
06:54:31.310 --> 06:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
a bunch of different states um and
 
06:54:33.830 --> 06:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
Colorado seemed to have although a
 
06:54:35.830 --> 06:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
rather complicated way of doing it it
 
06:54:39.150 --> 06:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
was the best way and it's worked um and
 
06:54:41.510 --> 06:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
I think representative bone brought up a
 
06:54:43.150 --> 06:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
really great point about how do you find
 
06:54:46.708 --> 06:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
an independent uh voter and the same
 
06:54:48.708 --> 06:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
question was asked in Colorado but
 
06:54:51.430 --> 06:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
somehow they managed to find them and uh
 
06:54:54.388 --> 06:54:54.398 align:start position:0%
it did even out so that it wasn't just
 
06:54:56.430 --> 06:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
Democrats and just Republicans it was
 
06:54:58.030 --> 06:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
Independence and it keeps you from
 
06:55:01.830 --> 06:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
getting a um a deadlock and I know that
 
06:55:03.190 --> 06:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
the question about the New Hampshire
 
06:55:05.350 --> 06:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution states that the legislature
 
06:55:07.468 --> 06:55:07.478 align:start position:0%
shall make the apportionment of
 
06:55:09.948 --> 06:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
Representatives or redistrict but the
 
06:55:12.388 --> 06:55:12.398 align:start position:0%
Constitution does not say how the
 
06:55:15.150 --> 06:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
legislature is to make the abortion and
 
06:55:18.230 --> 06:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
what process it has to follow so in this
 
06:55:20.868 --> 06:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
bill the legislature participates in the
 
06:55:23.350 --> 06:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
redistricting process
 
06:55:26.750 --> 06:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
um and sets up a new process and is
 
06:55:30.150 --> 06:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
overseeing it so with that um I would
 
06:55:32.350 --> 06:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
just like to thank everybody um for
 
06:55:35.990 --> 06:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
indulging me thank you further uh
 
06:55:38.270 --> 06:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
discussion on the
 
06:55:42.548 --> 06:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
bill all right I guess I'll close so um
 
06:55:44.788 --> 06:55:44.798 align:start position:0%
going to be voting against this uh for a
 
06:55:47.430 --> 06:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
multitude of reasons um I've brought an
 
06:55:50.030 --> 06:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
article in from January 29th 2024 of
 
06:55:52.548 --> 06:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
this year from decision desk uh
 
06:55:54.310 --> 06:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
regarding Michigan's independent Rising
 
06:55:55.948 --> 06:55:55.958 align:start position:0%
commission so decision desk by the way
 
06:55:57.070 --> 06:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
in case you guys know that's not some
 
06:55:58.990 --> 06:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
like right leaning you know Breitbart
 
06:56:01.190 --> 06:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
blog that's they just they're election
 
06:56:03.510 --> 06:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
nerds right they just look at numbers so
 
06:56:05.070 --> 06:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
titled did Michigan's redistricting
 
06:56:08.030 --> 06:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
process reduce black turnout they argue
 
06:56:10.030 --> 06:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh but there's some things in here
 
06:56:11.990 --> 06:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
that I think are very interesting so
 
06:56:13.830 --> 06:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
after Michigan's independent reging
 
06:56:15.788 --> 06:56:15.798 align:start position:0%
commission for the first time in 68
 
06:56:17.310 --> 06:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
years Detroit will not have a single
 
06:56:19.430 --> 06:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
black Congressman for the first time in
 
06:56:22.910 --> 06:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
68 years uh majority minority District
 
06:56:25.510 --> 06:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
in Michigan went from five in the Senate
 
06:56:28.150 --> 06:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
10 in the house to five in the house
 
06:56:33.468 --> 06:56:33.478 align:start position:0%
period period period so even when you
 
06:56:34.910 --> 06:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
get to something that's independent
 
06:56:37.230 --> 06:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
redistricting right it's not always kind
 
06:56:39.830 --> 06:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
of what you want to get to the problem
 
06:56:41.868 --> 06:56:41.878 align:start position:0%
is is when you try to live in the
 
06:56:44.350 --> 06:56:44.360 align:start position:0%
fantasy land of removing politics from
 
06:56:46.868 --> 06:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
this process you get to something you
 
06:56:49.070 --> 06:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
basically deny what it is it is an
 
06:56:51.350 --> 06:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
inherently political process I promise
 
06:56:53.670 --> 06:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
you had Michigan
 
06:56:55.548 --> 06:56:55.558 align:start position:0%
uh elected officials been involved you
 
06:56:58.310 --> 06:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have gotten to a five majority
 
06:57:00.430 --> 06:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
minority district in Michigan you
 
06:57:02.150 --> 06:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't and I I can virtually guarantee
 
06:57:03.990 --> 06:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
you you'd probably have at least one
 
06:57:07.110 --> 06:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
black person representing Detroit in
 
06:57:09.350 --> 06:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
Congress so it doesn't always get you
 
06:57:12.070 --> 06:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
where you want to go um I was thinking
 
06:57:13.830 --> 06:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
about this last night there's actually
 
06:57:15.150 --> 06:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
very few of us on the committee that
 
06:57:16.990 --> 06:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
were involved intimately in the
 
06:57:19.030 --> 06:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
registering process last year
 
06:57:21.910 --> 06:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lane was one of them um
 
06:57:23.150 --> 06:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
but that I actually think are we the
 
06:57:24.948 --> 06:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
only two on the committee I think we
 
06:57:27.270 --> 06:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
were um and there were some there were
 
06:57:29.430 --> 06:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
things said during there that I you know
 
06:57:30.548 --> 06:57:30.558 align:start position:0%
you have to be quiet because that
 
06:57:31.548 --> 06:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
they're bringing things to court you
 
06:57:33.750 --> 06:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
know they're going to sue um but I kind
 
06:57:35.628 --> 06:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
of wanted to address some things because
 
06:57:37.708 --> 06:57:37.718 align:start position:0%
this is my uh this is my let's call it
 
06:57:39.548 --> 06:57:39.558 align:start position:0%
my redistricting airing of
 
06:57:43.628 --> 06:57:43.638 align:start position:0%
grievances um so my friends at the ACLU
 
06:57:46.430 --> 06:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
um used to be one of the most you know
 
06:57:48.350 --> 06:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
Center um let's call it I don't want to
 
06:57:50.708 --> 06:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
say ideological but um principle driven
 
06:57:52.628 --> 06:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
organizations right these are the the
 
06:57:54.350 --> 06:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
people that took on the horrible task of
 
06:57:55.708 --> 06:57:55.718 align:start position:0%
representing the clan when they wanted
 
06:58:00.070 --> 06:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
to March right they sue in Arkansas they
 
06:58:02.110 --> 06:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
sue in South Carolina they sue in South
 
06:58:05.150 --> 06:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
Carolina but they don't Sue in Illinois
 
06:58:06.868 --> 06:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
they don't Sue over Jerry mandering in
 
06:58:09.030 --> 06:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
Illinois and I've brought copies of
 
06:58:10.270 --> 06:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
Illinois's congressional district if
 
06:58:12.830 --> 06:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
you'd like to look at them um I think
 
06:58:14.030 --> 06:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
that they would meet what you would call
 
06:58:15.830 --> 06:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
the definition of Jerry mandering so
 
06:58:17.350 --> 06:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
it's so curious to me how the
 
06:58:19.670 --> 06:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan ACLU just manages to
 
06:58:22.270 --> 06:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
overlook um manages to overlook illin
 
06:58:24.510 --> 06:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
Illinois manages to overlook Illinois
 
06:58:26.350 --> 06:58:26.360 align:start position:0%
but yet yet manages to go to Republican
 
06:58:28.910 --> 06:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
states um our friends at America votes
 
06:58:31.230 --> 06:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
the nonpartisan group they are funded by
 
06:58:32.708 --> 06:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
the Democrat legislative Campaign
 
06:58:36.150 --> 06:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
Committee and the DNC as a whole so like
 
06:58:37.510 --> 06:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
love them I think I'm I'm working with
 
06:58:39.948 --> 06:58:39.958 align:start position:0%
them on the U CA bill um but they're
 
06:58:39.958 --> 06:58:41.070 align:start position:0%
them on the U CA bill um but they're
hardly

06:58:41.070 --> 06:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
hardly
 
06:58:43.708 --> 06:58:43.718 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan right uh lastly and this one
 
06:58:45.868 --> 06:58:45.878 align:start position:0%
hurt me the most because my grandmother
 
06:58:46.948 --> 06:58:46.958 align:start position:0%
was a member of the League of Women
 
06:58:48.548 --> 06:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
Voters the League of Women Voters New
 
06:58:51.388 --> 06:58:51.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ran a Facebook ad redirecting
 
06:58:52.990 --> 06:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
voters not women voters but student
 
06:58:55.270 --> 06:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
voters redirecting student voters to the
 
06:58:58.590 --> 06:58:58.600 align:start position:0%
Grafton County Democrats uh YouTube
 
06:59:01.270 --> 06:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
page so it's hard to like take these
 
06:59:04.030 --> 06:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
things seriously when you have groups
 
06:59:06.190 --> 06:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
that are not always kind of presenting
 
06:59:08.388 --> 06:59:08.398 align:start position:0%
what they are who they say they are um
 
06:59:10.230 --> 06:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
lastly let's talk about my friends the
 
06:59:12.230 --> 06:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
mapathon the open democracy action
 
06:59:14.708 --> 06:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
subgroup right so they came here and
 
06:59:16.830 --> 06:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
they testified and they said that the
 
06:59:19.230 --> 06:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
least gerrymandered map currently in
 
06:59:20.788 --> 06:59:20.798 align:start position:0%
existence is the new current New
 
06:59:23.468 --> 06:59:23.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Congressional map that is
 
06:59:25.310 --> 06:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
arguably the most Jerry Mander map
 
06:59:27.430 --> 06:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's currently existed and in fact its
 
06:59:29.510 --> 06:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
entire purpose when it was drawn
 
06:59:31.150 --> 06:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
dividing Manchester nashille was
 
06:59:33.190 --> 06:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
actually to suppress the Catholic vote
 
06:59:35.270 --> 06:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
we just haven't changed it since then um
 
06:59:37.070 --> 06:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
don't believe me look it up it's all
 
06:59:40.708 --> 06:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
there it's all there so that map has
 
06:59:43.510 --> 06:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years produced One Cong
 
06:59:46.548 --> 06:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
one Republican Congressman one time so
 
06:59:49.990 --> 06:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
it has a 5% win rate for Republicans yet
 
06:59:52.788 --> 06:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
46% of the vote has gone
 
06:59:55.670 --> 06:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
to Republicans so 46% of the voters have
 
06:59:59.468 --> 06:59:59.478 align:start position:0%
been represented 5% of the time um hard
 
07:00:01.788 --> 07:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
to take that seriously when you say that
 
07:00:03.830 --> 07:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's the least Jerry maned map they
 
07:00:06.670 --> 07:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
also happen to be suing over the State
 
07:00:09.628 --> 07:00:09.638 align:start position:0%
House map once again they said the
 
07:00:11.070 --> 07:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
Congressional map is the least Jerry
 
07:00:13.110 --> 07:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
maned map the State House map so they
 
07:00:14.910 --> 07:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
they use the standard right of oh look
 
07:00:16.868 --> 07:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
at the Statewide vote right look at the
 
07:00:18.948 --> 07:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
Statewide vote the State House map was
 
07:00:20.310 --> 07:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
the one that got closest to the
 
07:00:22.990 --> 07:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide vote it was off by like half a
 
07:00:24.868 --> 07:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
percent and yet that's the one they're
 
07:00:26.788 --> 07:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
suing over and are they suing to move
 
07:00:28.548 --> 07:00:28.558 align:start position:0%
one Ward and Keen over to make the whole
 
07:00:30.150 --> 07:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
map work no they're suing throughout the
 
07:00:31.910 --> 07:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
whole map they're s throughout the whole
 
07:00:34.628 --> 07:00:34.638 align:start position:0%
map so they're not in my opinion I I
 
07:00:35.948 --> 07:00:35.958 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to view them as honest
 
07:00:38.670 --> 07:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
brokers in this conversation um you know
 
07:00:40.190 --> 07:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
when we did the registrating probably
 
07:00:41.430 --> 07:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
the the smartest thing that ever came
 
07:00:43.110 --> 07:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
out of my mouth was this is a thankless
 
07:00:45.670 --> 07:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
process it's an ugly process um and you
 
07:00:47.270 --> 07:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
can do one of two things you can make a
 
07:00:48.548 --> 07:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
map that looks good or you can make a
 
07:00:51.510 --> 07:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
map that actually functions um to try
 
07:00:55.350 --> 07:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
and separ seate this process from the
 
07:00:57.350 --> 07:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
legislator is to further remove it from
 
07:00:59.350 --> 07:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
the voters not to further empower the
 
07:01:01.948 --> 07:01:01.958 align:start position:0%
voters this bill would further Empower
 
07:01:06.830 --> 07:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
judges not further Empower people um I I
 
07:01:08.948 --> 07:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
understand that this is the way we draw
 
07:01:13.150 --> 07:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
district is not popular it is not um it
 
07:01:14.628 --> 07:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
is not always definitely not pretty I
 
07:01:18.030 --> 07:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
can assure you that um but to try and
 
07:01:20.070 --> 07:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
act like it's not political just denies
 
07:01:22.388 --> 07:01:22.398 align:start position:0%
what it is so I will be voting against
 
07:01:23.430 --> 07:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
this I'll be voting against future
 
07:01:25.350 --> 07:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
efforts of this because I truly believe
 
07:01:27.350 --> 07:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
in my heart of hearts um and I would say
 
07:01:29.868 --> 07:01:29.878 align:start position:0%
this if I was in the minority um that
 
07:01:31.548 --> 07:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
this is a process that the farther it
 
07:01:33.548 --> 07:01:33.558 align:start position:0%
gets away from the legislator the more
 
07:01:35.788 --> 07:01:35.798 align:start position:0%
concocted and actually the more distance
 
07:01:37.110 --> 07:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
from actually being representative it
 
07:01:39.590 --> 07:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
will be so with that those are my cing
 
07:01:41.070 --> 07:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
arguments I brought everything if you'd
 
07:01:43.510 --> 07:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
like to see it um and that is my um
 
07:01:48.350 --> 07:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:50.110 --> 07:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
redistricting all right the clerk will
 
07:01:51.708 --> 07:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
call the role on the motion of ought to
 
07:01:53.468 --> 07:01:53.478 align:start position:0%
pass do
 
07:01:55.990 --> 07:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
amended feel like we need droppable mics
 
07:01:58.430 --> 07:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
cuz that could picture you dropping a
 
07:02:00.110 --> 07:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
mic after that
 
07:02:04.868 --> 07:02:04.878 align:start position:0%

representative Lane will take otpa right
 
07:03:21.510 --> 07:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
