00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
and a test to make sure that I'm not
 
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
getting early onset
 
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 align:start position:0%

63a okay is it okay we had agreed that
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
the 632 A3 would be removed as well as
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
this line five where it was

oh is that the misdemeanor domestic
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
violence yes okay and should not be
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
there and then the other one was um the
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.870 align:start position:0%

for
 
00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.870 align:start position:0%
for
right

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm me a second s
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
um we agreed that we were going to keep
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
632 the aggravated yes but I just but
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
the next one over 632
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
A3 that's the one I'm fonex right that
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
was the other one huh
 
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
no yes why
 
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:43.549 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:46:43.549 --> 00:46:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
I believe the two that we discussed uh
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
the two charges we discussed were
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence under RSA
 
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
631 uh colon
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
2B uh and stocking under RSA 63 3 colon
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh 3A um the those are misdemeanor uh
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor offenses um they can be
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
felonies so so for example if a deadly
 
00:47:12.549 --> 00:47:12.559 align:start position:0%
weapon uh is used or was threatened to
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
be used um then a person would be
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
charged under the domestic violence
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
statute with a felony rather than a
 
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor um and uh stalking uh if a
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
person has a prior conviction
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
the person would be charged with a
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
felony uh rather than a misdemeanor uh
 
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
part of the issue is all of the
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard from the court
 
00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
system about how those two particular
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
charges in uh uh in general would just
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
create uh a lot of additional hearings
 
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
uh that would basically Drive the cost
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
of this uh way way up and and given the
 
00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
fact that we have uh uh additional
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
protection for domestic violence uh
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
victims uh elsewhere in the package
 
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
we'll be talking about uh today um we
 
00:48:03.549 --> 00:48:03.559 align:start position:0%
may want to modify uh that language yeah
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
we had an agreement on that and I am
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
sticking to it um I had told all us only
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
the Felon ver felony versions so what
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
what we need here is we need to
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
specify um for stalking we need to say
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it would it suffice
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
to say felonius stalking or would it or
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
should we say stalking second fon should
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
cover it right and the same thing with
 
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
domestic violence it should say fonus
 
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and that should take
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
one hold on I'm trying to find where
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
about oh you're talking about yeah we're
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
not talking about that one that's that's
 
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
staying that is a felony we're talking
 
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
about the next one domestic violence we
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
need to we need to specify felonius and
 
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
then we're talking about um line
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.789 --> 00:49:23.799 align:start position:0%
um 632 A3 which is wait a minute no
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's delonia sexual
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
salt where's the stocking one
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
David oh here it is yeah line five um it
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
says stalking under RSA 633 colon 3
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to add the word felonius
 
00:49:41.549 --> 00:49:41.559 align:start position:0%
under that that's all just to ensure
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
that those two crimes are only the
 
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
felony versions that will be um
 
00:49:48.349 --> 00:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
referenced as being held for a
 
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
judge okay so I've made the note of
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
those two things we will submit that
 
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
that change um let's move on next bill
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.549 align:start position:0%
we're not
okay

00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.710 align:start position:0%
 
two

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
personing probable cause of this yeah
 
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
okay um instead of probable cause clear
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
and convincing yeah we we we've gone
 
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
over that one and um if someone is held
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
someone for someone to be arrested on a
 
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
charge of one of these violent heinous
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
charges the threshold is probable cause
 
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
to arrest them and generally you would
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
have what's called a probable cause
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
hearing um to set the bar for these
 
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
crimes and we don't do it anywhere else
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
in the statutes except for these crimes
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
higher than the threshold to make the
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
arrest in other words a police officer
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
arrested someone for for
 
00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:55.720 align:start position:0%
example kidnapping and they they've got
 
00:50:57.309 --> 00:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe they committed
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
the kidnapping by making it clear and
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
convincing we've set the standard higher
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
for the so there's a threshold enough to
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
arrest them and prove that they did it
 
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
but now we're going to set even higher
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
standard to say they can be held um and
 
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't seem to make any sense
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
now I didn't try to apply that to any of
 
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
the other statutes that we've addressed
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
only this one that the Senate and we
 
00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
agreed on for the felonious charges um
 
00:51:26.789 --> 00:51:26.799 align:start position:0%
so I'm open to discuss that if if if you
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
think that um if you think that that's
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
why well when we talked about it in the
 
00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:39.799 align:start position:0%
past um I don't know that we really
 
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
addressed this during the hearings much
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
we heard from two County uh County
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys who said that setting that
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
burden of clear and convincing was um
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
very difficult for them to meet um at
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
that early stage because they haven't
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
even gotten a trial yet um having said
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
that I did not change it for the rest of
 
00:52:05.549 --> 00:52:05.559 align:start position:0%
the bail statutes just for these crimes
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
here that's the only place you'll see a
 
00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
change to probable
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
cause um so uh I'm like I said anyone
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
have any substantial
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
David represent me sorry I'm that's okay
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
um one of the things is that the the
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
eviden evidentiary standard um does
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
increase you know with each additional
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
encounter a defendant has with the court
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
system so so for instance the standard
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
of evidence required you know for uh for
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
holding a person on bail is different
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
from the standard of evidence required
 
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
to convict that person um
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that uh that just
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
strikes me strikes me about this is
 
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
after you've had time to uh to organize
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
thoughts uh begin to put put a case
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
together um
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
the probable cause as an evidentiary
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
standard is about as low on the rung as
 
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
we can possibly get um and uh you know
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
the whole idea that we're seeing a judge
 
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
um you know to me you know it it entails
 
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
that there would be some sort of higher
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
evidentiary standard to hold hold a
 
00:53:22.829 --> 00:53:22.839 align:start position:0%
person you can hold a person based on
 
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
probable cause but but um you know to
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
actually continue to hold them to me
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
require should require some higher
 
00:53:32.079 --> 00:53:33.789 align:start position:0%
require should require some higher
evidentiary

00:53:33.789 --> 00:53:33.799 align:start position:0%
evidentiary
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
standard thank you representative Stone
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would uh support
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
the probable cause standard when the
 
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
individual goes before a a Justice they
 
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
understand probable cause and I think if
 
00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
you add a higher degree just for the
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
purpose of detention you kind of uh I
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
don't know it just looks like you're
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
really setting three standards of uh
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
probable cause you have articulable
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
suspicion you have clear and
 
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
convincing Beyond a reasonable doubt I
 
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
would say that a judge is more than
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
capable of finding probable cause for a
 
00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:11.030 align:start position:0%
capable of finding probable cause for a
detention

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
detention
 
00:54:15.309 --> 00:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
hearing um the the only issue I have is
 
00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:17.799 align:start position:0%
that in and this is the way I see it
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
this this occurs relatively shortly
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
after the arrest um I mean we're talking
 
00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
what are the they have to be heard
 
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:30.799 align:start position:0%
um within 24 hours um and if we're
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
setting a higher standard within 24
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
hours that what it really does is it
 
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
raises the threshold to
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
arrest for to clear and convincing
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
evidence because if the if the officer
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
has probable cause at the point of
 
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
arrest within 24 hours he has to have a
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
higher standard now to have the person
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
who is arrested for one of these crimes
 
00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about murder a sexual
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
assault felonius um it's that's a very
 
00:54:57.789 --> 00:54:57.799 align:start position:0%
short time period for them to develop
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
their case enough to make the the next
 
00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
higher burden of clear and convincing
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
and we're only talking about these very
 
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
violent um horrible crimes not the
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
entire bail system so that that's just
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
my my thoughts on that is that you you
 
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
may as well change the standard to
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
arrest for these crimes to clear and
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
convincing because you've only got 24
 
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
hours to come up with more evidence to
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
meet the next burden and frankly I'm not
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
even sure if someone can articulate what
 
00:55:27.029 --> 00:55:27.039 align:start position:0%
that what the difference is between
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
probable cause and clear and convincing
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
um within that 24-hour period
 
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative Stone do you have
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
a idea of the difference of those two
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
standards to me it's a practical matter
 
00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
as we're going back to having
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
individuals arraigned on probable cause
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
hearings for felonies at the circuit
 
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
court level at that time typically in
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
the past before they had felonies first
 
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
the uh probable cause hearing was
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
usually determined if there was probable
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
cause for the arrest of the charges and
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
at the same time time normally the
 
00:55:58.829 --> 00:55:58.839 align:start position:0%
issues of bail were raised at that time
 
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:00.039 align:start position:0%
to see if the defendant should be
 
00:56:02.349 --> 00:56:02.359 align:start position:0%
released or if they should remain in
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
custody and like you said Mr chair I
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
think if you have somebody getting
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
arrested and going before a judge within
 
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
you know 24 hours what facts and
 
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances are really changing from
 
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
the point of arrest to the point where
 
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
you're going up for a bill hearing it's
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
a you're really not gaining anything
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
you're still having an initial
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
appearance you're really not having a uh
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
wellth thought out strategy to argue
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
bail unless you know there's an attorney
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
involved at a later stage that can
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
articulate why an individual shouldn't
 
00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
be held or why the prosecutor feels they
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
should be held I just don't see that
 
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
there's such a narrow scope of time that
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
you can't really validate a different
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
standard other than probable
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
cause and there is um they are entitled
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
to a further hearing after this if I'm
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
not mistaken
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
correct that would be
 
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
correct so this is the initial
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
appearance on one of these serious
 
00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:55.870 align:start position:0%
appearance on one of these serious
crimes

00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
that we talking about not not the final
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
decision on whether or not they get
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
bailed any other thoughts representative
 
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
Murray um yeah I think you're right
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
there like we were we would in this case
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
it would be a hearing still until they
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
had an official bail hearing before the
 
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
court right so it's still not um the
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
other thing I was wondering though is
 
00:57:21.789 --> 00:57:21.799 align:start position:0%
this like probable cause that like
 
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
they've committed the crime or is it
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
probable cause that a danger to you know
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
what I mean that's that's a good point
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
that's a good point um first what you
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
said originally um regarding this is
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
their first appearance and we did not
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
change the language for the next for the
 
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
bail hearing which is clear and
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
convincing so their bail hearing is
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
still clear and convincing evidence this
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
is the original appearance where it's
 
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
probable cause and it is probable cause
 
00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
that they're a danger not that
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily that they committed the
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
crime crime however with these crimes I
 
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
I would argue that the um the very
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
nature of the crime itself if there's
 
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe you did it
 
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
there's probable cause to believe you're
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
dangerous um which is why I would assume
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
the Senate picked these dangerous crimes
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
other words if there's probable cause to
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
believe that you committed robbery it's
 
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
probable that you're also dangerous um
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
if there's probable cause to believe
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
that you committed felonia sexual
 
00:58:25.029 --> 00:58:25.039 align:start position:0%
assault which is rape it's probably that
 
00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
you're dangerous so I think that that's
 
00:58:28.829 --> 00:58:28.839 align:start position:0%
the reason the Senate picked those and
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
that's the reason that for this initial
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
appearance not the bail hearing that
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to after but the
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
initial appearance before a magistrate
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
or the judge the um the standard is
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
basically the same as the arrest that
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
was made just 24 hours earlier further
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
discussion anyone else have any thoughts
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
that one thing I I I do want to say is
 
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that um
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh in the amendment uh we are specifying
 
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
uh that the hearing needs to take place
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
within 24 hours actually helps a lot of
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
things um and this this I this is one of
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
them okay all right so can we can we
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
agree to leave that then probable causes
 
00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:13.039 align:start position:0%
anyone I think that we is for this
 
00:59:13.039 --> 00:59:15.789 align:start position:0%
anyone I think that we is for this
initial

00:59:15.789 --> 00:59:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
hearing considering they are entitled to
 
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
a further bail hearing representative
 
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
wheeler you look like you want to say
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
something do you I mean
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
if there is I don't want to blow up the
 
00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
agreement I just think that there might
 
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
be some constitutional questions with
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not someone can be held
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
because this is about someone's uh
 
00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:41.960 align:start position:0%
Flight Risk or dangerousness and I think
 
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:43.720 align:start position:0%
that there may be some constitutional
 
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not a constitutional scholar but I
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
think that there may be some
 
00:59:48.029 --> 00:59:48.039 align:start position:0%
constitutional question as to whether or
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
not um that is kosher with our
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
constitution in terms of clear and
 
00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
convincing rather than than probable for
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
someone being held and determining
 
01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
dangerousness based on probable cause or
 
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
or clear and convincing evidence so that
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
would be my only uh trepidation I guess
 
01:00:09.029 --> 01:00:09.039 align:start position:0%
but if the committee agrees then well um
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
I'm also not a constitutional scholar
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
however I did sleep on a good bed last
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
night and I have researched this a
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
little bit many states the standard um
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
what you have is a probable cause
 
01:00:22.349 --> 01:00:22.359 align:start position:0%
hearing to determine whether or not you
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
should be help because if there's not
 
01:00:27.549 --> 01:00:27.559 align:start position:0%
probable cause you're released so um I I
 
01:00:29.309 --> 01:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
think it's clearly constitutional it's
 
01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
just a matter of what we decide and I
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
think that as a state we have left the
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing standard alone for
 
01:00:38.349 --> 01:00:38.359 align:start position:0%
the bail hearing itself not this initial
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
appearance um we say that we want a
 
01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:42.039 align:start position:0%
little bit more evidence to hold
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
somebody but in the case of just these
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
crimes which are pretty heinous and just
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
for their initial appearance um we
 
01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't require law enforcement to
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
develop a higher standard within 24
 
01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
hours than they needed to arrest the
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
person that that's my that's my thing
 
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
and if to representative M's point if if
 
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
this weren't within 24 hours if it was
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
say 72 hours or more then I would agree
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay they have some time to develop this
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit more but seeing as this is
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
the initial appearance that we set at 24
 
01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
hours because we want to give people a
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
chance to get out we also have to think
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the state and the victim and say okay
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
we we don't want to make a higher burden
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
um within 24 hours
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.029 align:start position:0%
um within 24 hours
so

01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
um all right let's move on to the next
 
01:01:31.029 --> 01:01:31.039 align:start position:0%
um issue I think actually one additional
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
issue we wanted to on 252 yeah that's
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to add oh okay yeah what
 
01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
else do you
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
got well there's the um the issue of uh
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring um the the at the
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
the very end um can you give me a line
 
01:01:47.309 --> 01:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
number and a p oh sorry well this is uh
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
line uh page two line it starts at uh 28
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
and ends at 32 if I'm not not mistaken
 
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
um and we're we would like there to be a
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh warrant issued for any other tracking
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
info other than where that person is
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
relative to their ba bail conditions
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay that that doesn't sound
 
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
unreasonable I just have to find where
 
01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
you are um well we're looking to add it
 
01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of line 32 on page two line
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
32 where it says the court May seek
 
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursement you want to add another
 
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
sentence after that which or a sentence
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
within that paragraph that related to
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring wherever OS thinks
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
it makes sense that says that uh a
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
warrant must be issued for any extra
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
information other than related to what
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
that person's bail conditions are okay
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
all right let's think that through for a
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
second the court is the one who is
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
ordering the electronic monitoring they
 
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
the same person who would issue a
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
warrant the electronic monitoring is
 
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
being conducted by the court or whoever
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
they hire to do it and the instructions
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
are that in the I don't know what line
 
01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
it is that says that they report
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
violations directly to the police
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
department but that's all so I could see
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
a warrant for the police to obtain any
 
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
other information that is recorded by
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
this is that would that be sufficient I
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
think that would be sufficient so that
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
they can't say hey what else you got
 
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
exactly the concern is uh police being
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
able to access the electronic monitoring
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
information for extra things which AG
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
would you know create some
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
constitutional consc do the members
 
01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
agree the rest of the yeah conversation
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
that we did we did have I remember that
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
yeah represent
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
M yeah the reason the reason for this is
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
a court case called Commonwealth versus
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
Norman Massachusetts Virginia or
 
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania um and one of the things I
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
would say is that um are are judges in
 
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire may be even more
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
protective of privacy than judges in
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I agree um so um one of
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
the things that I I wanted to suggest if
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
we're looking for a place to put this
 
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
yeah down at the bottom of page three uh
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
under line 37 uh what we could do is add
 
01:04:05.069 --> 01:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
yeah one more section uh section d d d
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and where it something like this Mr
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
chair a law enforcement officer shall
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
not use monitoring data for any other
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
purpose other than ensuring the accused
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
does not violate conditions of bail or a
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
protective order a warrant shall be
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
obtained for any other usage that sounds
 
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.069 align:start position:0%
obtained for any other usage that sounds
perfect

01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.079 --> 01:04:40.349 align:start position:0%
 
252

01:04:40.349 --> 01:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
252
 
01:04:40.359 --> 01:04:53.150 align:start position:0%
252
okay

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.160 --> 01:05:02.349 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:05:02.349 --> 01:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
well I was just gonna I think we were
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
had the same thought uh the only other
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
thing that we had to add was
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
um on the six uh 53 the in Branch uh
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
commission yeah we would we would like
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
to add something which says that the
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
legislative branch should be the chair
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
of the commission uh because we've heard
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
testimony which says that the court
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
being uh chair of this commiss has
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
created some friction you know we
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
actually just discussed that ourselves
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
um the only concern I have with that and
 
01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:33.640 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm happy either way is the
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
legislature often has some turnover and
 
01:05:38.829 --> 01:05:38.839 align:start position:0%
that would prevent continuity in
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
leadership if for example I got made
 
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
chair and then I don't get reelected or
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
choose not to run next time you have a
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
new chair coming in and I mean you would
 
01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
have continuity for two years at a time
 
01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
at least so I either way if if you guys
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
really feel like that's important um
 
01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
then we can put that the um the
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
legislative um member be the chair
 
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
that's fine with me it was representa
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
Katherine the other piece is um I think
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
that we had the conversation like um um
 
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
two folks from the legislative branch to
 
01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
from the Senate and we talked about
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
those types of things because I don't
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
see any of that well that here we need
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
the actual um original commission does
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
anyone can we let's see if we can get
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
the original um the original bill that
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
created this commission is what we need
 
01:06:27.549 --> 01:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
because it's all listed in there who's
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
on it and what their rules are so we
 
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
would have to actually address that okay
 
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
if you guys don't have any other changes
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
to discuss we'll take a break and get
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
that and then reconvene in 15 minutes
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
how's that yeah everyone agreement
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
represent me did you have something
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
before we do that okay all right 15
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.000 --> 01:14:52.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.280 --> 01:33:00.149 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.229 --> 01:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
and we're
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
back um at this point a couple things
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
first we're going to um quickly discuss
 
01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
the change regarding the makeup of
 
01:33:13.709 --> 01:33:13.719 align:start position:0%
the of the um inter Branch criminal ju
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
Justice and criminal and Juvenile
 
01:33:15.239 --> 01:33:16.229 align:start position:0%
Justice and criminal and Juvenile
Justice

01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
01:33:16.239 --> 01:33:17.750 align:start position:0%
Justice
Council

01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
Council
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
um based on recommendations we received
 
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
from people that were involved before um
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to amend add to the bill um
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
which bill was it that talked about that
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
653 653 to just make one change that um
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
currently it says the
 
01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
members elect a chair from among
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
themselves we're going to put it that
 
01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
the um the legislative member from the
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee will chair
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
the commission or committee or councel
 
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
um that way um for a couple reasons
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
since the purpose of this is to
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
recommend legislation it should be a
 
01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
legislator who knows the makeup of the
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
house and how things are going in the
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
house that shares it um we we recognize
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
that the person could change every
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
couple years um but that would be the
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
case anyway because a new speaker can
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
change at any point who he puts on
 
01:34:19.149 --> 01:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
commissions or councils or committees so
 
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
we feel like that that's negligible So
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
based on the recommendations we received
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to make that change let's
 
01:34:26.639 --> 01:34:30.910 align:start position:0%
we're going to make that change let's
use

01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
653 now I'm going to attempt to go
 
01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
through all the changes that we're going
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
to make TOs and what we're going to do
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
is we're just going to agree on it and
 
01:34:42.669 --> 01:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
then we're going to go over to OS and
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
we'll get the final version printed for
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
tomorrow that way we don't have to stay
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
here all day waiting for the the changes
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
so let me go go through the builds I
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
them may notice that I'm somewhat
 
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
chair the changes that we just agreed to
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
well we changed 249 I believe a couple
 
01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
things right 2
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
252 Oh actually 249 um there's a
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
reference in 249 on page five line 22 to
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
apparently to a statute that doesn't
 
01:35:44.189 --> 01:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
exist um it says subject to RSA 597 col
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
2 10 and 11
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
um they're unable to find an 11 anywhere
 
01:35:51.390 --> 01:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to have to seek clar
 
01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
verification on what that's supposed to
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
be or strike it that's the first
 
01:35:59.709 --> 01:35:59.719 align:start position:0%
one then
 
01:35:59.719 --> 01:36:04.390 align:start position:0%
one then
252

01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
we agreed to
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
change we're going to require we're
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
going to add a section D um on page
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
three at the bottom that says law
 
01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement um cannot use the
 
01:36:20.109 --> 01:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
information obtained through the
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring for any other
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
purpose and if they wish to get any
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.629 align:start position:0%
 
warrant

01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
01:36:31.629 --> 01:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
and looks like that was it was there
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
anything else that I'm missing that we
 
01:36:35.629 --> 01:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.639 --> 01:36:37.149 align:start position:0%
 
change

01:36:37.149 --> 01:36:37.159 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
notating yes oh yes and um that's also
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
what bill is that that's that's 22 252
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
as well hold
 
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
on and also on 252 where the list of
 
01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:54.159 align:start position:0%
crimes are are we agreed that we are
 
01:36:57.310 --> 01:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
going to specify felonious domestic
 
01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:59.390 align:start position:0%
going to specify felonious domestic
violence

01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
violence
 
01:37:02.430 --> 01:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
and bonus
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
stalking and I believe that was
 
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
it does that sound right so that
 
01:37:10.109 --> 01:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be in those two rsas right
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
which one what do you mean okay so RSA 6
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
yeah they would have to change whatever
 
01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
RSA to make sure it fits the felonius so
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
the whole thing would have to be changed
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
language well because we still want the
 
01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.430 align:start position:0%
language well because we still want the
felony

01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
felony
 
01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
verion you know what I mean yeah okay
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise the Senate's not going to conc
 
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
okay any other any other questions
 
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
everyone agree with those changes if
 
01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
everyone's agreement um please anyone
 
01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
how about this anyone who disagrees
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
who's on the subcommittee with any of
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
the changes I just listed based on that
 
01:37:49.149 --> 01:37:49.159 align:start position:0%
are we all in agreement um to send this
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
to LS and this is what we will present
 
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
to the full committee
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um let me just take a
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative tenar yes representative
 
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
Stone yes representative Muse yes
 
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative Murray representative
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
Reed yes representative Pratt yes
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative Willer yep representative
 
01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
here at gath R that's a one question oh
 
01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
dear God I know all right going back to
 
01:38:14.189 --> 01:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
the probable cause and the clear and the
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
convincing yeah um I really would like
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
to be certain that that's not um that
 
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
it's okay to use that and it's not you
 
01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
know affecting um as you said our
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights um okay the only
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
way to to be certain of that would be to
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
ask the court and I don't think we have
 
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
time to get the opinion of the court on
 
01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
that um as I spoke to a representative
 
01:38:38.669 --> 01:38:38.679 align:start position:0%
from the ACLU who voiced a similar
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
concern if it turns out that that would
 
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:42.950 align:start position:0%
concern if it turns out that that would
be

01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional they can bring that um
 
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
to the Senate and I told them I would
 
01:38:49.229 --> 01:38:49.239 align:start position:0%
not um not concur because of that if it
 
01:38:51.310 --> 01:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
comes that it has to go back to that it
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
just has to go back to that um that's
