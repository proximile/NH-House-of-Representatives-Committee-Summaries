thank you representative
 
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
um so representative Wallace can you
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
give us a little bit of detail on the
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that you were circling around
 
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:47.700 align:start position:0%
in Municipal and County and uh give it
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
as an update sure as uh as we've
 
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.110 align:start position:0%
as an update sure as uh as we've
discussed

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
um the committee has identified a couple
 
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
of areas that we can take some what we
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
thought could be some pretty immediate
 
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
action uh specifically with reference to
 
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
requiring only
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances uh building codes fire
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
codes plumbing codes and uh things of
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
that nature that are in effect at the
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
time of issuance of the building permit
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
much like we're constrained to not make
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
any retrospective law that particular
 
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
amendment to SB 78 was was ruled
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
not germane enough so we won't be able
 
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
to move on that at this point in time so
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to put a Billet in the fall
 
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh chair and vice chair of Municipal
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
County government saw fit uh with this
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
particular idea that they feel strong
 
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
enough to get on board as sponsors as
 
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
well so uh I'll submit that this fall
 
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
with my fellow members of the committee
 
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
as co-sponsors
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
and hopefully things will move forward
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
without hedge my hope is that we can get
 
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
everybody on this committee on board
 
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
but that we'll we'll look at the
 
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
language in the fall but thank you Scott
 
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
that's at least one thing coming out of
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
this committee is something we've seen
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
is a something easy that we can get done
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
and so hopefully there's more things
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
that we can move forward on so at this
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
point I want to call on dick anagnos
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%

um just press the button now there is it
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
on now perfect thank you
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
uh first
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me the
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
opportunity to appear before you today
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
um this is a very serious issue in our
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
state and it's an issue I've been
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
dealing with for close to 40 years
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:11:59.150 align:start position:0%
dealing with for close to 40 years
um

00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
I know that the committee is doing great
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
work in in trying to make inroads into
 
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
um the issue of Housing and within the
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and it's not just
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
Workforce and affordable housing that we
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
need we need all types of housing which
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing is here and
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
they'll elaborate a lot more than that
 
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
then I will be able to however the way I
 
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
got into building Workforce and
 
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
affordable housing is because my
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
employees couldn't find a place to live
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
and this is back in the 1980s so this is
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
a deal uh situation that we've been
 
00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
dealing with for a very long time
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
in my opinion though this is a solvable
 
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.050 align:start position:0%
in my opinion though this is a solvable
issue

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
the problem is there's been no
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
Constitution or or
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
effort put forth to solve it as a result
 
00:12:44.769 --> 00:12:44.779 align:start position:0%
of our
 
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
own inability to get out of our own way
 
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.150 align:start position:0%
own inability to get out of our own way
sometimes

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
so the major issue that that
 
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
you people are attempting to solve is a
 
00:12:59.210 --> 00:12:59.220 align:start position:0%
lack of housing the reason that there's
 
00:13:03.129 --> 00:13:03.139 align:start position:0%
a lack of housing is because there is
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
impediments to building housing at a
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
lower cost
 
00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:11.459 align:start position:0%
those impediments come as a result of
 
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
home rule which I am fully in favor of
 
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.310 align:start position:0%
home rule which I am fully in favor of
however

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.810 align:start position:0%
however
um

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
Saint anselms College recently did some
 
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
good work on the atlas which you guys
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
are aware of that put out before us a
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
glaring picture of how bad off we really
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
are that there's no continuity of
 
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.430 align:start position:0%
are that there's no continuity of
Regulation

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
Regulation
 
00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:34.019 align:start position:0%
that everybody's interpretation of the
 
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
ordinances and the regulations that
 
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
they've created is different
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
there's even from my experience the
 
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:42.380 align:start position:0%
interpretation of regulations from
 
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
sector within the same government from
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
the building department to the playing
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
Department that are different from one
 
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:50.339 align:start position:0%
another all of those things create
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
uncertainty in when you have uncertainty
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
it costs money
 
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.889 align:start position:0%
it costs money
the

00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:01.019 align:start position:0%
government cannot solve this alone the
 
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
private sector can solve the housing
 
00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:07.019 align:start position:0%
issue and it can solve it without the
 
00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
resources that you guys have been
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
putting forth because you'll never put
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
enough resources forth to be able to pay
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
enough money you'll never be able to
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
develop enough resources to pay enough
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
money to solve the problem
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
the way we're doing it now
 
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
I was the first developer in the state
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
who used low-income housing tax credit
 
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
program in 87 which it was initiated in
 
00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
86. I am the largest private developer
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
of Workforce housing in the state having
 
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
developed over 2 000 units of it either
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
in partnership with New Hampshire
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
Housing partnership with the Manchester
 
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
Housing and Redevelopment partnership
 
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
with National Housing Redevelopment
 
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
partnership with HUD directly so I have
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of experience developing these
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
programs are utilizing the programs and
 
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
the programs themselves will not solve
 
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
the problem what will solve the problem
 
00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.949 align:start position:0%
the problem what will solve the problem
is

00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
two things one of them it's called
 
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
planning which is something we don't do
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
very much of in New Hampshire what we do
 
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
is we have knee-jeric reactions
 
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
okay so if there's a blip where the
 
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
schools are overcrowded there's no more
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
housing that's allowed in one way or
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
another it's defeated
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
either through directly saying we don't
 
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
want your project or through providing
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
obstacles that we can't overcome in
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
order to develop the project cost
 
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.269 align:start position:0%
order to develop the project cost
effectively

00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's a which New Hampshire is known
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
for that's why we're the first in the
 
00:15:32.569 --> 00:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
nation primary there's a significant
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
amount of nimbyism which you guys are
 
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:36.710 align:start position:0%
aware of
um

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
in a recent project I had my Butters
 
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
were in favor of the project but other
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
townspeople were not in the latest over
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
two years
 
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
through different ways of
 
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:47.689 align:start position:0%
through different ways of
um

00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
of bringing forth
 
00:15:50.519 --> 00:15:52.790 align:start position:0%
of bringing forth
unfounded

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
unfounded
 
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.250 align:start position:0%
unfounded
um

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:54.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
concerns that just continued to cost us
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
more money to to prove that they were
 
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
unfounded concerns in the end they were
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
all unfounded concerns and one of the
 
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
funniest results is the project is now
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
open and operating and the people that
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
were against I think it's absolutely
 
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.829 align:start position:0%
were against I think it's absolutely
beautiful

00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
beautiful
 
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
but moving on from there there were two
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
major issues that I'd like to address
 
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
one of them is planning
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
our local municipalities received their
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
right to Zone and create regulations
 
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
from our legislature okay zoning all
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
stems The Authority all stems from the
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
legislature the only way that we're
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
going to solve this is the legislature
 
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:33.740 align:start position:0%
needs to put together a cohesive program
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
with either a stick in a carrot that
 
00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
allows or that essentially demands that
 
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
local municipalities adhere to
 
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
um the need to address these housing
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
situations and I could sit here and tell
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
you horror shows that I've been through
 
00:16:53.689 --> 00:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
I won't waste your time with all of that
 
00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:55.019 align:start position:0%
um things that have been done to
 
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:56.839 align:start position:0%
obstruct And Delay
 
00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
outright picketing
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
um literally threats at some points in
 
00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
time I mean it goes on and on but
 
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
realistically we're looking for a
 
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
solution we're not looking to go back in
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
history and correct what's been done so
 
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
the solution is the first part of the
 
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
solution in my opinion is something
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be done at the state level it
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
brings all the municipalities in line
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
and agree that if you do this then you
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
get this if you don't do that then you
 
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
don't get this either that or I know
 
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
that the gov owner is recently working
 
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
on an incentive program but what I've
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
run into in the local municipalities is
 
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
okay they give us an incentive we don't
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
want it okay we'd rather keep our town
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
exactly the way it is we don't want the
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
character change and no matter what you
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
bring in the character is going to
 
00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:44.510 align:start position:0%
bring in the character is going to
change

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
so the carrot really hasn't worked well
 
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
over the years the stick is going to
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
have to be utilized at some point
 
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
going along with that the key to
 
00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
developing housing is density
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
that's a four-letter word by any
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
proficient speller in the development
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
business okay because density is what
 
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
everybody does not want
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
when you hear the word density they
 
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
think of projects when you hear the word
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
density they think of overcrowding when
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
you hear the word density they think of
 
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
tons of school children when you hear
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
the word density they say our traffic
 
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
impacts are going to be
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
irrehensible or our inability to deal
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
with them none of that is factual those
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
are the arguments we've been overcoming
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
for years to get what limited housing
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
we've been able to do now
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
but think about this for a second if you
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
there was a little bit of planning
 
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.350 align:start position:0%
there was a little bit of planning
meaning

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
somebody looked at their town map and
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
said we have water and sewer here we
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
have good access to roads here we have
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
adjacency to Services here and said
 
00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:48.980 align:start position:0%
we're going to make this zone for
 
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
multi-family for condos for high low or
 
00:18:58.669 --> 00:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
smaller lot sizes okay and we take a
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
step back and we go to our forefathers
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
and we look at how Manchester I'll use
 
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
as an example was developed
 
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
the mill him Escape Mills came in they
 
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
built the Mills and the first ring
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
around the Mills what did they put high
 
00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:15.419 align:start position:0%
density housing multi-family and the
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
next ring around the multi-family what
 
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
did they put
 
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
small lot single family housing and the
 
00:19:24.049 --> 00:19:24.059 align:start position:0%
next ring around now what happened Elm
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
Street was developed and that's where
 
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
they put Commercial Services
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
so therefore I'm not
 
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
advocating for some new Village type
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
um development here I'm advocating to go
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:42.299 align:start position:0%
um producing a brand new project right
 
00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:43.610 align:start position:0%
um producing a brand new project right
now

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
it consists of 280 000 square feet of
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
Industrial Development which is going to
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
produce 1200 jobs and we already have
 
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
the business that's going to move into
 
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.169 align:start position:0%
the business that's going to move into
it

00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
we have no place to put those workers so
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
on the same site we're proposing 304
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
Apartments we're proposing twenty
 
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
thousand square feet of small retail so
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
that they can go to the store and get
 
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
something so that they can go to their
 
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
gyms so that they can go to get their
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
hair done or whatever the case may be
 
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
and we're proposing a ten thousand
 
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
square foot daycare because what's our
 
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
next number one problem after housing is
 
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
what do we do with our children
 
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to be a self-contained unit
 
00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:27.059 align:start position:0%
in the 90s I dealt with an international
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
corporation in Ohio and we came in and
 
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
planned the exact same thing they put
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
their big automobile manufacturing plant
 
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
in the middle
 
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:37.940 align:start position:0%
right around it they put the support
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
businesses that were going to be
 
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
necessary around that they put high
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
density housing for their workers around
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
that they put single-family
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
housing for their workers around that
 
00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
they put executive housing for their
 
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
Executives and then around that we
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
placed all of the retail and services to
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
support the overall development you know
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
Ohio is accepted immediately in New
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've run into well this
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet this regulation this
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet that regulation you're
 
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
going to have to get over this hurdle
 
00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
you need a variance you need a variance
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
for your retail you need a variance for
 
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
your residential you need
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
um you need to go get a special waiver
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
in order to have daycare there
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
so the impediments that have been
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
created we've created ourselves okay now
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
we need a way to remove those
 
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.190 align:start position:0%
we need a way to remove those
impediments

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
impediments
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
I want to go back to density for a
 
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
second we talked about a little bit of
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
planning so if that planning was to say
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
that 5 000 foot Lots were relative you
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
could put a significant number of homes
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
single-family homes and a very small
 
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
piece of land Manchester did it
 
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
at one point Manchester when Amelia was
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
originally created the size of the Lots
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
was 2500 square feet if it had water in
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
sewer then they went to five thousand
 
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
then they started with r1a and r1b and
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
they went from 5000 in this Zone to 7
 
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
500 to 12 500
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
um so even there where they have a very
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
Progressive zoning it's still a
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
situation where if it was all right for
 
00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:15.539 align:start position:0%
my family to live
 
00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
50 years ago in a 5 000 square foot lot
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
why is it not all right today and that
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
was considered entry level housing those
 
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
homes were sold at a reasonable amount
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
and you could build them at a reasonable
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
amount because you weren't paying for X
 
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
number of miles of your own
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
in another municipality in the one I
 
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
live in I had 300 acres of land
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
300 acres of land got me 96 homes
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
because I have a two acre minimum a 200
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
foot Frontage I have to have buried
 
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
underground utilities I have to have a
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
drainage system even though I don't have
 
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
enclosed drainage I have enclosed
 
00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
drainage in my project that leads the
 
00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:54.059 align:start position:0%
open Swale drainage
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
all of that incurred cost as cost is
 
00:22:59.330 --> 00:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
increased that the developer the cost of
 
00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
the land goes up as the cost of the Lots
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
go up the cost of the housing also has
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
to go up
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at conservation
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
very much in favor of in the state of
 
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
what did I conserve by building almost
 
00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:18.299 align:start position:0%
five miles of roadway what did I
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
conserve by putting in five miles of
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
drainage what that I can serve by by
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
digging up and putting five miles of
 
00:23:27.169 --> 00:23:27.179 align:start position:0%
underground utilities of that 300 acres
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
I'm impacting a hundred I donated 200 to
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
be into conservation I could have put
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
that 96 homes on 30 Acres
 
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay it would have been more cost
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
effective for me I'd have clustered them
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
together I'd have concentrated the
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
utilities I'd have concentrated the
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
drainage and I'd have preserved another
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
70 Acres on top of it and over and above
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
that I'd have been able to increase the
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
the situation is such where density
 
00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
should be driven by land loading you
 
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
have Wetlands you have slopes when known
 
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
as the granite state there's ledge
 
00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.169 align:start position:0%
as the granite state there's ledge
everywhere

00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
but if you have a piece of land and I'm
 
00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:06.419 align:start position:0%
going to describe to a real life
 
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
circumstance where I add 10 acres of
 
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.110 align:start position:0%
circumstance where I add 10 acres of
land

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
land
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the 10 acres of land was perfect
 
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
it had water and sewer it had gas it was
 
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
flat it had no Wetlands it had five
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
small little pockets where a farmer had
 
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:21.770 align:start position:0%
small little pockets where a farmer had
um

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
dug up a rot and it turned into a Vernal
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
pool the total impact on 10 acres of the
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
Wetland was about 2 500 square feet
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
really minimal
 
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:34.580 align:start position:0%
I was adjacent to Services
 
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
it had everything going for it that you
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
would want in a multi-family housing
 
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.330 align:start position:0%
would want in a multi-family housing
project

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
when I first started developing in this
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
town in late 1970s the eunuch density
 
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
was 24 units per acre
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's currently nine
 
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
the land loading we did an experiment we
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
brought in the engineers and we said
 
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
how many units could we put on this site
 
00:25:00.049 --> 00:25:00.059 align:start position:0%
that we could load on the land with the
 
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
services we have
 
00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:06.419 align:start position:0%
they came back with about 300 we got 90.
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
if I had put 300 number one the land
 
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
costs would have been a lot less number
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
two the land would have supported it
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
number three I could have rented those
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
units at significantly less money
 
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
because now I've spread my costs over
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
300 units instead of over 90.
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
so the whole concept of solving the
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
issue is going to come down to we need
 
00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
to rewrite our regulations to some
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
planning and create density and
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
everybody says okay density is
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
multi-family density is not just
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
multi-family density is townhouses
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
density is small single family lots in
 
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
the south side of Manchester if you
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
drive there I defy you to find many lots
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
that are over five or seven thousand
 
00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
square feet okay it has worked in the
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
past and it will work going forward and
 
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
it's because we got away from our Basics
 
00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
because we were knee-jerk reacting to
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
whatever impediment was before us at
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
that time whether it had been in the 80s
 
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
explosive growth whether had been
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
converting everybody to 55 and older if
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
you were going to get an approval in any
 
00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:15.059 align:start position:0%
reasonable period of time
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
I mean where the I think the Second
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
Great most graying State we created that
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
problem on our own we allowed the we
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
didn't allow the local planning boards
 
00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:27.539 align:start position:0%
allowed expedited approvals if you were
 
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
55 and older and you weren't bringing
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
any children
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
whereas my projects were taking two and
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
three years because I was looking for
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
multi-family that included children
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
I was looking for Workforce housing I've
 
00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
had more objections to Workforce housing
 
00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:48.059 align:start position:0%
than any of my projects each time I
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
bring forth Workforce housing
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
as a result of the fact that everybody
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
conjures up a project and I've literally
 
00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
had people tell me that as soon as I
 
00:27:00.409 --> 00:27:00.419 align:start position:0%
um mentioned the project that I was
 
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
having every drug dealer and Drug user
 
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
coming there and these are the
 
00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:06.059 align:start position:0%
perceptions that we need to get over
 
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
because that's not the truth by any
 
00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
stretch of the imagination
 
00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
but we Face these impediments because
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
we're labeled
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
when we say Workforce when we say
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
affordable we're labeled with a negative
 
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
connotation and the only people that
 
00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:24.419 align:start position:0%
come out in a planning board meeting are
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
the minority that are against it okay
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
the majority never comes out the
 
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
majority never supports
 
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
had the majority been there and your
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
elected officials
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
um I thank you for your service because
 
00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:40.580 align:start position:0%
it's not easy you have constituents
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
constituents that don't like your point
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
of view or don't like what you're
 
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
advocating on their behalf so rocks and
 
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
stones at you so imagine a poor planning
 
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
board member sitting up there who's got
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
his next door neighbor is pointing at
 
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
him and saying you're ruining our
 
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
neighborhood because you're going to
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
allow affordable housing into it they're
 
00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
under a significant amount of pressure
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
if the majority of the neighborhood was
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
there saying we support you it would be
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
a heck of a lot easier for them to make
 
00:28:08.769 --> 00:28:08.779 align:start position:0%
the right decision
 
00:28:08.779 --> 00:28:10.330 align:start position:0%
the right decision
the

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:10.340 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
next and final point that we'll take to
 
00:28:15.169 --> 00:28:15.179 align:start position:0%
solve this one is planning the other one
 
00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:16.580 align:start position:0%
is density and the other one
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative Scott was just mentioning
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
um housing codes
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
okay so housing codes continue to get
 
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:27.419 align:start position:0%
worse and worse and worse year to year
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
to year
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
if in fact the legislature adopts the
 
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:35.910 align:start position:0%
proposed 2023
 
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:36.230 align:start position:0%
proposed 2023

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.730 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
what is it called
 
00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:42.059 align:start position:0%
I don't remember exactly what the bill
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
is but it has to do with installation
 
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
and Energy savings and that kind of
 
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.390 align:start position:0%
and Energy savings and that kind of
stuff

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.049 align:start position:0%
stuff
um

00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:48.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
it will add around 12 to 15
 
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
000 per multi-family unit
 
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:57.419 align:start position:0%
because we'll have to use all mechanical
 
00:28:57.419 --> 00:28:59.630 align:start position:0%
because we'll have to use all mechanical
um

00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
ventilation within the units because
 
00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:03.419 align:start position:0%
they'll be building the building so
 
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
tight that the buildings don't breathe
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
any longer
 
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
energy will be so tight that the
 
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
buildings won't breathe any longer and
 
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a building that breeze
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
brings in fresh air you've got to do it
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
some way so now we're going to be
 
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.970 align:start position:0%
some way so now we're going to be
ducting

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
ducting
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
um ventilators and fins into every
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
single unit
 
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
rather than how many years did we build
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
successfully without this regulation so
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
you know this
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
movement to
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
save energy and to conserve energy is
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
actually working opposing the ability to
 
00:29:39.769 --> 00:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
produce affordable housing
 
00:29:39.779 --> 00:29:41.570 align:start position:0%
produce affordable housing
um

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
the codes themselves are written for
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
something that's constructed new
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
we have a built environment Manchester
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
Nashua Rochester and conquered okay we
 
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
have a built environment
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
we can renovate schools Office Buildings
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
buildings that we've successfully
 
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
utilized and changed their life by
 
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
turning them into housing one of the
 
00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
largest impediments to rehabbing and
 
00:30:11.169 --> 00:30:11.179 align:start position:0%
turning something into housing is that
 
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
the building was built in the early
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
1900s and the late 1800s and trying to
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
adapt those buildings
 
00:30:21.649 --> 00:30:21.659 align:start position:0%
to current codes as if you were building
 
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
a brand new construction is almost
 
00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.950 align:start position:0%
a brand new construction is almost
impossible

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
I started in tried it in Manchester on
 
00:30:30.169 --> 00:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
the main on Elm Street Elm Street was a
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
Dragway I opened up the first buildings
 
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
brought to First businesses I attempted
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
to build housing in the upper floors
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
which is what was there
 
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
when the muskeg Mills were operating
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
there was a first level was always
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
retail the second and third levels were
 
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
typically office space and then above
 
00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
those were typically housing
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of housing units exist there but
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
a number of years back we attempted to
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
bring before the legislature a
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
combination of Rhode Island and New
 
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
Jersey's codes for the rehab of
 
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.610 align:start position:0%
Jersey's codes for the rehab of
buildings

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
to get a stairwell that is acceptable
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
today to the fire department into one of
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
those buildings yeah you're going to
 
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
have to demolish most of the building
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
and be you're going to have to take up a
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
lot of valuable space
 
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
we went through an exercise on one
 
00:31:24.289 --> 00:31:24.299 align:start position:0%
building in Manchester where we got
 
00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:27.539 align:start position:0%
flexibility by not tearing out the
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
stairwells in the walls and that sort of
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
thing what we did was in one building we
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
kept the original stairwells in the
 
00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
front and built a larger stairwell in
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
the rear and it was acceptable to the
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
fire department at the time
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
another thing we did was we had the
 
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:44.750 align:start position:0%
another thing we did was we had the
original

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
tin walls and ceilings and stuff that
 
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
was very very historic that was in
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
really good shape they wanted us to
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
cover it with two two layers of five Ace
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
fire rated sheetrock
 
00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
um in order to meet the fire code what
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
we did there is we came up with an
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
Innovative way to run two sprinkler
 
00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:03.419 align:start position:0%
lines down a hallway
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
and create a quarter of water so what we
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
did was instead of making the walls the
 
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
protected Corridor we created a quarter
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
within the quarter of a curtain of water
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
on both sides so that someone could walk
 
00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
down through that curtain of water to
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
the exit just a lot of creative things
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
that we can do in order to meet the
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
codes however there's a little appetite
 
00:32:27.789 --> 00:32:27.799 align:start position:0%
to accept those kind of innovative ideas
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
the appetite typically that we run into
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
or the attitude that we typically run
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
into is this is the code that you need
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
this is the only way that's acceptable
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
to meet the code and put two layers of
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
five Ace fire rated on both sides so you
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
have a rated hallway and unless you do
 
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to give you an
 
00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.830 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to give you an
approval

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
so we need to be more Innovative in our
 
00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
thinking and adopt Innovative codes
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
okay and somehow that needs to be
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
communicated to the towns that they need
 
00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:00.419 align:start position:0%
to follow these codes
 
00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:03.539 align:start position:0%
we need to do some planning or Force the
 
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
towns to do some planning be proactive
 
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
instead of reactive
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
and place make Provisions for this type
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
of Housing and when I say this type it's
 
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
all types of housing
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
thirdly density needs to be addressed
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
and if you can get those three three
 
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
things into a developer's hands you're
 
00:33:24.409 --> 00:33:24.419 align:start position:0%
going to see that as long as he can make
 
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
a profit he is going to be able to build
 
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
housing that can be
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
good clean housing that can be
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
affordable in nature to the people that
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
are in New Hampshire working for a
 
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
living it astounds me when I go before a
 
00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:43.019 align:start position:0%
planning board and they say the resident
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
gets up and say we don't want those type
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
of people in our
 
00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.470 align:start position:0%
of people in our
um

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:51.169 --> 00:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
in our town the interesting part about
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
it though is in one town I'll give you a
 
00:33:57.649 --> 00:33:57.659 align:start position:0%
real life example I built a project that
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
was 25 Workforce housing
 
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
and in that 25 Workforce housing I have
 
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
seven police officers one firefighter
 
00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:10.379 align:start position:0%
four teachers all that work within the
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
confines of that town
 
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
when I went to build the sister project
 
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
to it again with 25 percent Workforce
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
housing because their own town ordinance
 
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
says that if you're going to build a
 
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
multi-family project you have to have 25
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
percent Workhorse housing
 
00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
I was met with Pittsburgh quarks and
 
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
machetes by most of the Town saying we
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
don't want those people in our town
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
even after the school teacher and the
 
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
police officer testified on our behalf
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
that we live here in this town and we
 
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
work here in this town and if we didn't
 
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
have these housing available to us we
 
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do that they still
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
fought against the project
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
so there are four things one of them is
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
planning one of them is zoning density a
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
third one is codes and then the fourth
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
one is we need to go through an attitude
 
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
change somehow in some way that says
 
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
that everybody has the right to live
 
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
here and everybody has the right to good
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
clean housing and everybody has the
 
00:35:14.089 --> 00:35:14.099 align:start position:0%
right to be able to afford that housing
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
within the salaries that they're being
 
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.990 align:start position:0%
within the salaries that they're being
paid

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
paid
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
short of doing that I wish you a lot of
 
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.490 align:start position:0%
short of doing that I wish you a lot of
luck

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:21.500 align:start position:0%
luck
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
you have a Herculean job on your hands
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to do a lot of this
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
for many many years unsuccessfully
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
um in by way of example a number of
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
years back when in soon as first term I
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
sat on a panel where we came up with the
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
idea of having
 
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
um a board to review
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
um approvals from towns which you guys
 
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
finally got approved and what happened
 
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
the following year there was a movement
 
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
to repeal of it before it even had a
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
chance to operate okay so that's the
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
kind of hurdle that you guys are facing
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
I'd love to entertain any direct
 
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
questions you may have thank you very
 
00:36:05.569 --> 00:36:05.579 align:start position:0%
much for your presentation it's been
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
helpful and I feel like it's kind of
 
00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
dovetailed with a lot of other
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
presentations I think we we see the
 
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
writing on the wall here a lot of a lot
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
of what you're saying
 
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:17.099 align:start position:0%
um does anybody have questions yep
 
00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:19.700 align:start position:0%
represent broody thank you Mr chairman
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
dick thank you very much for coming
 
00:36:21.839 --> 00:36:22.790 align:start position:0%
dick thank you very much for coming
today

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.750 align:start position:0%
today
um

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
I know when I asked you to come we had a
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
discussion and you said you had a
 
00:36:31.849 --> 00:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
kind of working on a plan with Governor
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
Benson and then of course uh he didn't
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
get reelected and Governor Lynch didn't
 
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
like your plan so
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
um it sounded interesting to me and
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be uh stir up some
 
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
interest here if you want to elaborate
 
00:36:46.849 --> 00:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
on that a little so Governor Benson
 
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
asked me to undertake a study and I wish
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
I'd still had it but to determine what
 
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
the real impediments were and a lot of
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
those impediments remain today and a lot
 
00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
of them we've just discussed the
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
governor has been an idea at the time
 
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.730 align:start position:0%
governor has been an idea at the time
was

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
the state funds municipalities in a lot
 
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
of different ways whether it be Highway
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
funds whether it be rooms and meals tax
 
00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
or you know there's a whole lot of Aid
 
00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:12.839 align:start position:0%
that comes from the state that goes to
 
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
each municipality Governors Benson ID
 
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
Governor Benson's idea at the time was
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
to tie
 
00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:20.339 align:start position:0%
all of that state aid that each
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
municipality gets to their ability to
 
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.390 align:start position:0%
municipality gets to their ability to
produce

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
produce
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
good clean affordable housing
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that's a reasonable
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
option either but that was being pursued
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
at the time when the election took place
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
and Governor Lynch took over Governor
 
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
Lynch didn't like the idea of of holding
 
00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
the town's hostage with state aid in
 
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
order to achieve a goal so that was the
 
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
idea representative Rudy that Benson had
 
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
come up with that if the states could if
 
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
the state could bring to the town's
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
attention the fact that they were
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
significantly deficient in their ability
 
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
to produce housing as a result of their
 
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
own codes then the state was going to be
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
holding whatever monies that they would
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
be entitled to over their head until
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
they solved that issue
 
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much apology so instead
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
of holding a town hostage under that
 
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.470 align:start position:0%
of holding a town hostage under that
same

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
framework Maybe
 
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
give the town an incentive instead of
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
holding something back give them
 
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
something extra if they would do
 
00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:26.339 align:start position:0%
something like this well I've run into
 
00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
that and the governor current governor
 
00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
has attempted to do that with New
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing and it hasn't worked
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
very successfully because if you already
 
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
have what you want
 
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
why are you enticed to take something
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
more than what you want in order to
 
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
compromise what you think isn't the
 
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
right thing to do
 
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
okay so the incentive only works if
 
00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
there's an appetite to accept the
 
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
incentive or if the incentive is large
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
enough which will never have enough
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
money to do that the incentive is large
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
enough in order to motivate them to
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
change the regulations okay the only
 
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
thing that's really going to work in my
 
00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
opinion is stick and naturally you're
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
going to have the municipal Association
 
00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
all over you guys and
 
00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
um you know there'll be significant
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
lobbying on behalf of home rule and that
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
you guys have taken over but one of the
 
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
things that is a bad word in
 
00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but it works is something
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
called 40b okay and in 40b in
 
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's a law under which
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
if a developer brings in a project into
 
00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
a municipality
 
00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
you know I'm going to just give you the
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
rough interpretation
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
and he's going to put in housing as long
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
as he's going to commit to 20 of that
 
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
housing being affordable or Workforce
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
then he can go to the state for his
 
00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
approvals and completely circumvent
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
approvals within the town
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay and even though that's a a tool
 
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
that's used regularly in Massachusetts
 
00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.609 align:start position:0%
that's used regularly in Massachusetts
and

00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:55.619 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
and towns can't stand it because
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
the state has usurped their ability to
 
00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
hear the project
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
it definitely gets everybody's attention
 
00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
when you're walking in and say I am just
 
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
going to go 40b the Town becomes a
 
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
little more Cooperative with you if they
 
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
don't want you to do it and if they're
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
just going to dig their heels in you
 
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
just go to the state and get your
 
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
approvals anyway
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
so I'm not advocating that that's the
 
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
best solution for New Hampshire but
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
that's one solution that appears to work
 
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts does bring on in every
 
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
one of those projects 20 of Workforce or
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:41.540 align:start position:0%
the housing Champion
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
certification that's making its way over
 
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
that does some of that carrot stuff but
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
I think dick is right that there's some
 
00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
municipalities that it's not enough it's
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
usually not enough for them to want to
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
adopt those changes
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
um representative Gibbs thank you Mr
 
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
chairman and um thank you for coming
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
here today sir uh uh are you familiar
 
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
with the U.S Department of Housing and
 
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
Urban Development HUD uh requirement
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
that uh recipients have had assistance
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
do an analysis of fair housing showing
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
what impediments they have in in their
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
municipality uh to fair housing and how
 
00:41:22.569 --> 00:41:22.579 align:start position:0%
they are going to further fair housing
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
we use a lot of Hud assistance now I
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
mean I've developed probably close to 5
 
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
000 apart not Apartments housing units
 
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire I've used
 
00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
every program that's out there I've used
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
HUD D4 I've used HUD 223 I've used New
 
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have a very long-standing
 
00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:41.339 align:start position:0%
relationship with New Hampshire Housing
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
and their light tech program
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
we've used Bond financing through the
 
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire in order to get
 
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
deals done but to go directly to your
 
00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.970 align:start position:0%
deals done but to go directly to your
question

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:53.930 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
that assessment currently is done now
 
00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
annually and it's called a react
 
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
inspection HUD
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
forces it that all of the dollars that
 
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
have gone into your project as a result
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
of them investing in your project they
 
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
put you through a react inspection which
 
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
makes sure that all of those housing
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
units meet their appropriate levels of
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
Code Enforcement so that you have good
 
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
clean housing uh this actually goes
 
00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.310 align:start position:0%
clean housing uh this actually goes
beyond

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
um the react inspection this is a
 
00:42:22.619 --> 00:42:23.890 align:start position:0%
um the react inspection this is a
separate

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:23.900 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:29.579 align:start position:0%
analysis or assessment that cities and
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
towns and states that receive HUD
 
00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:35.180 align:start position:0%
funding are required to do
 
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
to show what impediments they have to
 
00:42:43.609 --> 00:42:43.619 align:start position:0%
fair housing which clearly uh as as
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
you've explained the desire to exclude
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
those people
 
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
is very common and
 
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
um this is something that uh
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
cities and towns of states that receive
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
HUD funding are are required to review
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
and show HUD how they're going to
 
00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
correct it
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
um and this obviously is not going to
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
apply uh to every municipality in New
 
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.250 align:start position:0%
apply uh to every municipality in New
Hampshire

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:15.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
but a number of them do get HUD funding
 
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
directly and
 
00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:22.670 align:start position:0%
directly and
um

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh also
 
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
um quite a few uh get HUD funding
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
um on a year by year basis through the
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
state so uh do you think that if if we
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
looked at those assessments
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
um that we might be able to
 
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
shall we say find some things that that
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
ought to be corrected again that
 
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
attitude of let's not have those people
 
00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.510 align:start position:0%
attitude of let's not have those people
here

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:53.220 align:start position:0%
um is obviously part of the problem yes
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
and to further on something or to
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
expound upon something I said earlier I
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
understand your question I I'm sorry I
 
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
answered it inappropriately with react
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay so the only two directly entitled
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
communities I'm aware of of Nashua and
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
Manchester from HUD and I noted through
 
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
the HUD system we do a lot of other
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities but the prevalent
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
attitude that I deal with is okay you
 
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
want to give us that funding please keep
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
the HUD funding and also you keep all of
 
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
this housing out of our town
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
okay that's the prevalent attitude
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
HUD funding to a municipality if you're
 
00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
Progressive like Manchester Nashua is an
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
advantage if you're in some of the other
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns to Manchester and
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
Nashua they would rather say thank you
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
very much for your HUD funding you can
 
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
keep the HUD funding and therefore we
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
don't have to bring any of your
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing into our municipality
 
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
so HUD does a great job of like I said
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
through the react inspection of making
 
00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
sure that we have good clean housing but
 
00:44:59.329 --> 00:44:59.339 align:start position:0%
Hud's ability or the ability to receive
 
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
HUD funds to me in my opinion is not a
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
motivating influence in a town to say if
 
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
we don't want Workforce or affordable
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
housing we don't want that opportunity
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
in our town please just keep your
 
00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
funding it'll be an easy way for them to
 
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
avoid it
 
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
well this afternoon we'll be
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh follow up yes thank you
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm just uh gonna say you might be
 
00:45:22.849 --> 00:45:22.859 align:start position:0%
interested to know that this afternoon
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to be hearing from the New
 
00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:26.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire commission for human rights
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
which is the state's anti-discrimination
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
agency and also from the um uh New
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire field office director of Hud
 
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
so they'll be able to uh talk more about
 
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.630 align:start position:0%
so they'll be able to uh talk more about
that

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
um there are a couple of other
 
00:45:41.809 --> 00:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
entitlement communities
 
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
um I retired
 
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
um seven years ago now so I don't have
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
it all in my head the way I used to uh I
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
worked at full disclosure I worked for
 
00:45:52.849 --> 00:45:52.859 align:start position:0%
HUD for 29 years in the office of fair
 
00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
housing and equal opportunity
 
00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:56.930 align:start position:0%
housing and equal opportunity
um but

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
um uh just a suggestion that you might
 
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
just keep that in mind when when you're
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
talking to municipalities I commend your
 
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
service with HUD HUD isn't the easiest
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
organization to be able to work with for
 
00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
a long period of time but um I have
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
actually been to Washington I've
 
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
testified before Senate subcommittees
 
00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
and House subcommittees commissioned
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
with respect to HUD regulation I've been
 
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
down to Huda headquarters and testified
 
00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
there as well as to the impediments to
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
do this in New Hampshire and
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately my testimony seems to be
 
00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:35.579 align:start position:0%
the same it's very repetitive without
 
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
the private sector we don't solve this
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
government cannot solve the housing
 
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
problem it's impossible anyone that
 
00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:44.579 align:start position:0%
thinks it can will be paying so many
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
taxes that we will not be able to afford
 
00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
government by the time we try to solve
 
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
the housing problem it has to be solved
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
by the private sector what you need to
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
do to solve the problem bring in the
 
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
private sectors give us the tools to do
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
it okay you created all of the tools
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
that are in place now and you've they've
 
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
been created in such a way where they're
 
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
not workable and we're failing miserably
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
at our ability to achieve okay what you
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
need to do is throw all those rules Out
 
00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:12.839 align:start position:0%
start over again and give us the tools
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
by which to go solve this problem in the
 
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
private sector we'll solve it private
 
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
sector solves everything as long as a
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
developer can make a profit
 
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
building it two thousand square foot or
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
1500 square foot first time house okay
 
00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:28.859 align:start position:0%
and it's a reasonable profit which
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
developers used to make roughly 20
 
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
percent their margins have been squeezed
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
down to around nine percent now so you
 
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
don't see a lot of people building and
 
00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
doing this because it's almost not worth
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
doing any longer
 
00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
but as long as there was a program under
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
which we could develop and we could make
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
a reasonable profit for our efforts and
 
00:47:50.089 --> 00:47:50.099 align:start position:0%
still bring him in at a lower cost than
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
that's what what needs to be done I mean
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
volume buying I don't think to stay once
 
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
again where we produce a lot of lumber
 
00:47:59.690 --> 00:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
why don't we volume buy all the lumber
 
00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
in the state and provide it at cost to
 
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
the builders that are building stick
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
build homes I mean there's a lot of
 
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
crazy ideas we can deal with but it's
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
all got to start with the changing of
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
the attitude and it's all going to start
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
with zoning and regulation
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo uh thank you
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for your
 
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
presentation it's really um
 
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.849 align:start position:0%
presentation it's really um
exciting

00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
exciting
 
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
um you know you mentioned the low income
 
00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit program and that is
 
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:31.370 align:start position:0%
one of the
um

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
best programs for housing production the
 
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
thing is this a lot of um there are some
 
00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:41.339 align:start position:0%
misnomers about the LA HTC program for
 
00:48:41.339 --> 00:48:42.109 align:start position:0%
misnomers about the LA HTC program for
one

00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:43.730 align:start position:0%
one
um

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:44.930 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
the rents aren't low
 
00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
in order for a person to be able to
 
00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
afford a housing tax credit apartment
 
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
they low-income people would need a
 
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:00.740 align:start position:0%
voucher because the
 
00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.270 align:start position:0%
voucher because the
rents

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
rents
 
00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:02.870 align:start position:0%
rents
um

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
at low income house tax float income
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit programs are the
 
00:49:11.809 --> 00:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
fmr the
 
00:49:11.819 --> 00:49:13.069 align:start position:0%
fmr the
um

00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
fair market rent
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
so therefore a person who is probably a
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
single person you know with kids would
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
not be able to afford
 
00:49:26.569 --> 00:49:26.579 align:start position:0%
um Those runs without a voucher so I
 
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
feel like the program has been misnamed
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
and probably that's why you know
 
00:49:35.809 --> 00:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
people NIMBY people sort of like back
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
away from the whole concept
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
so having used the program since 1988
 
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
and having developed close to a thousand
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
units with the program in partnership
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire housing
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that your fmr
 
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
is driven by lack of housing
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay so what is what drives the fmr
 
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
supply and demand
 
00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
so if the demand is high and the supply
 
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
is very low that allows landlords to
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
raise their rents if the supply was high
 
00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
then rents would be a lot lower the more
 
00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
Supply we can bring online the lower the
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
rents are going to get driven because
 
00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
everybody wants a full unit and if
 
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
you're not going to if you think you're
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
going to hold it the rent above what
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
anybody can pay for it and still be able
 
00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
to have your unit filled you're you're
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
barking up the wrong tree so fmr is
 
00:50:28.849 --> 00:50:28.859 align:start position:0%
driven by supply and demand we're in a
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
situation where we have almost no Supply
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
and we have a very large demand so
 
00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:35.579 align:start position:0%
that's what's driving that
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
the second thing with respect to the
 
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
light tech program is you have all
 
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
different levels they have 30 percent
 
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
median income you have 50 median income
 
00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
you have 60 media income you have 80
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
median income and really there's some
 
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
programs that go up to 120 percent of
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
median income okay it's the median
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
income that that drives the rent okay
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
most of our subsidy or our subsidy is so
 
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
meager I think it's I know Ben Frost is
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
in the room and and he may be able to
 
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
Enlighten you a little bit more on the
 
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
limit but New Hampshire my last time my
 
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
check got under three million dollars
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
closer to two million dollars in lightak
 
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
okay two million dollars in my tech
 
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
isn't going to solve anything it's a
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
drop in the bucket when you consider a
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
project right now of 100 units is about
 
00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
20 million dollars okay
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
to do a 20 million dollar light tech
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
project you're taking the entire State
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
subsidy to do 100 unit deal
 
00:51:34.609 --> 00:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
so they have to be very very judicious
 
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
and they work on smaller projects and
 
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
more diverse Geographic areas to try and
 
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
cover the state which is their mandate
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
and large density projects don't really
 
00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:47.579 align:start position:0%
get done well because there isn't enough
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
subsidy to drive them
 
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
same thing you guys have the
 
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
the fund and I appreciate that you guys
 
00:51:56.569 --> 00:51:56.579 align:start position:0%
are trying to devote more and more money
 
00:51:58.970 --> 00:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
to the affordable housing fund But there
 
00:51:58.980 --> 00:51:59.990 align:start position:0%
to the affordable housing fund But there
again

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:52:02.089 --> 00:52:02.099 align:start position:0%
construction costs are so high land
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
costs are so high land costs are so high
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
because of the regulation that we have
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
to develop on a single family house and
 
00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
right now in New Hampshire
 
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
82 000 is added for just regulation
 
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
okay for us to go through the permitting
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
process and meet regulation
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
forget the land cost we've just spent
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
eighty two thousand dollars a unit
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
okay so when you figure the average lot
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
cost for a lot in New Hampshire right
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
now is well over a hundred thousand
 
00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:32.750 align:start position:0%
now is well over a hundred thousand
dollars

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
we're 180 000 approaching 200 000 we
 
00:52:39.049 --> 00:52:39.059 align:start position:0%
haven't built anything yet
 
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
okay we need to get those costs down
 
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
um on that question before I uh
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
are you able or your company can you
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
send us specific regulations that you're
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
dealing with that gets that 82 down I'd
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
like to look at those specifically
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
because maybe those are some things that
 
00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
we can look at as a committee and then
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
the second thing is you mentioned
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
adopting a like when you adopt a
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
building to a current code when it's an
 
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
is there a specific part of the rsas
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
that we can look at that might classify
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
older buildings and loosen up the code
 
00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:17.579 align:start position:0%
the code on that and you know new
 
00:53:19.609 --> 00:53:19.619 align:start position:0%
development would have to follow the
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
code but maybe the older buildings like
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking about in Manchester
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
um conquered you know on the river those
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
kind of things like we could look at
 
00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
that as a separate classification is
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
that classified separately or no
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
um yes all of that can be done the
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
information I have is old though last
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
time I addressed this Governor Benson
 
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
was in office and I think we adjust the
 
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
code issues in O3 so the information is
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
out there I just don't have it in my
 
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
disposal but think about this for a
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
second when I started developing real
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
estate in 1978 the obligation of a road
 
00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:56.579 align:start position:0%
and utilities was on the municipality
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
fast forward to today that obligation to
 
00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
build that road in those utilities are
 
00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
on me so the only way I can get paid
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
back is by adding that cost to a housing
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
unit when I first started developing
 
00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
real estate there was not no such thing
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
as an impact fee now there's an impact
 
00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
fee for parks for the fire department
 
00:54:17.569 --> 00:54:17.579 align:start position:0%
for the police department for the school
 
00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
department and in some municipalities
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
that rises between 10 in one
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
municipality I can tell you in the
 
00:54:26.809 --> 00:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
northern part of our state I paid twenty
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
four thousand dollars per unit to the
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
town as a fee for impact fees for one
 
00:54:35.089 --> 00:54:35.099 align:start position:0%
apartment unit okay there are towns that
 
00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:36.900 align:start position:0%
I work in right now for one residential
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
unit that are approaching twelve
 
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
so and now you get the land cost you've
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
got your development cost of eighty
 
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
thousand you get an impact fee on top of
 
00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
that okay those are the kinds of things
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
that have driven the cost of housing out
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
of sight now I've got to build my road
 
00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
I've got to bring my utilities
 
00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
by the time I get around to building a
 
00:55:00.049 --> 00:55:00.059 align:start position:0%
single family house on some of these
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
lots I'm three hundred thousand dollars
 
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:02.750 align:start position:0%
lots I'm three hundred thousand dollars
in

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know how I would produce
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
something that was going to
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
be achievable for someone making fifty
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year which used to be
 
00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
a very large sum of money in New
 
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for wages but that's a
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a week no one making a
 
00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a week is going to get
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
a home from me when my cost before I've
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
even built the structures three hundred
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that's why developers
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
moved to the I don't wanna
 
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
use the cliche of the mcmansions
 
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:32.339 align:start position:0%
the bedford's the wyndhams all of those
 
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
mcmansions all of the developers moved
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
to those areas because the regulations
 
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
drove the cost of the house High
 
00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
when you were still dealing with a
 
00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
high-end buyer you could still make a
 
00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
reasonable profit
 
00:55:47.329 --> 00:55:47.339 align:start position:0%
we've got to make it so that the
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
developer comes back to the
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
the local municipalities and still be
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
able to make a reasonable profit on what
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
he builds and that takes away the desire
 
00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
to build mcmansions
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
the other thing is with those costs that
 
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
I've been mentioning at three hundred
 
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or 200 000 into a lot
 
00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
before you build a house you have to
 
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
build a mcmansion to make a buck
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I didn't directly answer
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
your question representative chair
 
00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
um all of that information is out there
 
00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
but my information is dated we would
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
need to have conduct a study currently
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
to bring all that information up to date
 
00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:24.829 align:start position:0%
to bring all that information up to date
okay

00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
my question getting back to the
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
Innovative solution with the water
 
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
curtain that you had redoing that old
 
00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:35.450 align:start position:0%
curtain that you had redoing that old
building

00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
I assume it's the ahjs that are
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
unwilling to come to compromise and
 
00:56:41.329 --> 00:56:41.339 align:start position:0%
solutions and they just want to go
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
strictly by the fire codes
 
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
who came up with the water curtain idea
 
00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just what I'm seeking for is a
 
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
way to to maybe encourage some of this I
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
came up with the water curtain idea the
 
00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
chief of of fire in Manchester thought
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
it was Innovative and he made
 
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
our presentation to the fire marshal at
 
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
the state in order to get it approved
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay so we sold local municipality but
 
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
you know our codes will are fraught with
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
you need to do it this way
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
into the
 
00:57:16.559 --> 00:57:17.809 align:start position:0%
into the
um

00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
and at the discussion of the local
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
building official
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
so you could all be local building
 
00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
officials and I assure you if you read
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
one of the regulations each one of you
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
would have a different opinion on what
 
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
that regulation means
 
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
so when it's left up to the discretion
 
00:57:35.809 --> 00:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
of the local building official or the
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
local Fire official
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
if that person is against you getting
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
your project done then it's interpreted
 
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
one way if he's in favor of you getting
 
00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
your project done which is directly the
 
00:57:49.849 --> 00:57:49.859 align:start position:0%
answer to your question then he'll make
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
an effort to figure out a way to achieve
 
00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
it with you in this case fire chief was
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
Kane he went to the Fire Marshal's
 
00:57:59.930 --> 00:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
office and said we think this is a good
 
00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
idea let's try it and I got everybody to
 
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
buy in on the idea that the curtain
 
00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
water was equally protective as the two
 
00:58:11.569 --> 00:58:11.579 align:start position:0%
layers five base fire it
 
00:58:11.579 --> 00:58:13.190 align:start position:0%
layers five base fire it
fire

00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
fire
 
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
um sheetrock and the engineer that was
 
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
hired even said that the water curtain
 
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
was better
 
00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
it gave more protection because it was a
 
00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:25.140 align:start position:0%
constant flow of water coming down to to
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
fight any threat okay whereas the
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
sheetrock still Burns it just burns at a
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
um represent McConkey
 
00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman Alexander and
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for being here
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of we keep hearing that you know
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer is is a must my question
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
is if density in the rural areas was
 
00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
sufficient your 5 000 square foot or
 
00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
smaller lots have you or would you
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
consider some sort of centralized water
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
and or sewer speaking of the state
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't regulate if you're up to nine
 
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
users on one well and and some sort of
 
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
septic for X number of units have you
 
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
ever considered that or would that be a
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
non-starter for you no I've actually
 
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
built it so there's been a significant
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
innovation in septic systems okay where
 
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
they're rechargeable now
 
00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:23.890 align:start position:0%
they're rechargeable now
um

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:23.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:29.660 align:start position:0%
their designed for smaller areas
 
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
in Rochester New Hampshire I have a
 
00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
septic system that's Services 204
 
00:59:34.859 --> 00:59:35.990 align:start position:0%
septic system that's Services 204
Apartments

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
Apartments
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay so yes the answer to the question
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
is you can get there
 
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
again can you afford it as a result of
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
all of the other things to the
 
00:59:48.049 --> 00:59:48.059 align:start position:0%
development process that you're paying
 
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
for if you if those things went away
 
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
then yes you could afford
 
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.829 align:start position:0%
then yes you could afford
the

00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:54.839 --> 00:59:55.549 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
I call it hyperactive the hyperactic
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
septic where everything gets eaten
 
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
quicker and
 
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
um you have multiple Chambers and it's
 
01:00:05.329 --> 01:00:05.339 align:start position:0%
cleaned and that sort of thing with
 
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
respect to the Wells I have my own Water
 
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
Systems I am a water system supplier
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
regulated by
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
um Des as a result of supplying water to
 
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
multi units yes that's all achievable
 
01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
but you still got to build your water
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
system and you still got a dig your
 
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
Trulia one or two or three Wells for
 
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
your project those costs added on to the
 
01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:29.579 align:start position:0%
cost of the development that we go
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
through and lack of density that we have
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
makes it cost prohibitive to do okay so
 
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
if some were to give somewhere you could
 
01:00:39.549 --> 01:00:39.559 align:start position:0%
still meet the demand in the rural areas
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
by having the ability to do exactly what
 
01:00:44.569 --> 01:00:44.579 align:start position:0%
you said provide your own water in in
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
septic okay but it comes at a cost and
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the food chain the cost
 
01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
needs to give so if I'm going to be in a
 
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
rural area and I'm going to put in the
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
special septic and in my own water
 
01:00:59.930 --> 01:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
system then I still need to
 
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
be able to achieve
 
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
the cash flow in order to do that and
 
01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
currently the only way I do that is by
 
01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:08.579 align:start position:0%
increasing the rent or increasing the
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
sales cost of the house
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
if I didn't have all of the over
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
regulation here and the impact fees and
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
had to build the road and do everything
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
else I could then afford
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
the septic and the well so it all comes
 
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
back down to to this is strictly a
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
financial exercise truly is what it is
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
okay it's what does it cost the
 
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
developer to produce the unit and what
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
can we get what impediment can we take
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
out of his way to reduce that cost to
 
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
therefore reduce the cost of the housing
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
if I could just follow up yep uh what's
 
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
your economy of scale how how large does
 
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
a project have to be for you to consider
 
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
it is it 20 units 50 200 units well let
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
me pose it to you this way you put the
 
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
same amount of effort into 100 unit
 
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
project as you put into a 10 unit
 
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
project because when you go to the
 
01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
planning board it's the same site plan
 
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
it's the same calculations it's the same
 
01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:05.339 align:start position:0%
drainage it's the same everything
 
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
the only thing I can tell you that costs
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
saved there is the scale makes your
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
engineering costs a little bit less but
 
01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:13.619 align:start position:0%
other than that you're putting forth all
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
the same effort so if you're going to
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
put forth that effort then you naturally
 
01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
want to try and put it forth on the
 
01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
largest project you can get so that you
 
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
can get the best bang for your buck but
 
01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
I have developed single families I've
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
developed two families I've developed
 
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
four families five families eight
 
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
families 20 families 20 unit buildings
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
50 and right now my company doesn't look
 
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
at a project unless it's 100 units or
 
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
more okay because it's the only way that
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
I can be certain that a company of my
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
size can still make a profit
 
01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
thank you okay we're working on wrapping
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
this up but representative Damon then
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative Reed representative Walsh
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned I think you said a 204
 
01:02:55.799 --> 01:02:56.930 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned I think you said a 204
unit

01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
project that you did in Rochester that
 
01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
you put in the septic and so forth so
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
could you just expand on how did that
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
work financially based on what you just
 
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
said what were the trade-offs that made
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
it feasible so our Entry Road
 
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
or the main entry to our project is Town
 
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
Road for the first hundred feet
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
after that internally the town allowed
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
us to build our internal roads and keep
 
01:03:26.089 --> 01:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
them private at significantly less
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
specification than what the Town Road
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
would normally have been Town Road
 
01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
wanted 28 feet wide four foot shoulders
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
on each side enclosed drainage six
 
01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:39.859 align:start position:0%
inches bituminous based two inch
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
bituminous top uh 18 and 6 box which
 
01:03:47.569 --> 01:03:47.579 align:start position:0%
means the gravel sizes that go in it
 
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing when we went to build
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
our interior roads they were literally
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
35 percent of the cost of a Town Road
 
01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
so with the savings of the cost of the
 
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
roadways we were able to justify the
 
01:04:06.289 --> 01:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
who what
 
01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for the cost of
 
01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
maintaining those moderately the town is
 
01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
the first hundred feet where the school
 
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:16.740 align:start position:0%
children are picked up and that sort of
 
01:04:19.849 --> 01:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
thing and we maintain the inside but the
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
way we were able to design it
 
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
representative was our parking lots
 
01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:26.579 align:start position:0%
right off of all of those interior roads
 
01:04:28.609 --> 01:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
so they're when you go to powder parking
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
lot it isn't much more effort to plow an
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
extra 100 or 200 feet of roadway that's
 
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
leading up to it okay so we were able to
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
to design integrate the roadways as if
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
they were part of our parking lot system
 
01:04:45.309 --> 01:04:45.319 align:start position:0%
okay um representative Reed
 
01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:48.059 align:start position:0%
thank you and I just want to apologize
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
for missing the first part of your
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm moving much slower than I
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
would like to today
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
um I appreciated what I did here and I
 
01:04:58.730 --> 01:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the concept or hearing
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
the concept
 
01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:03.299 align:start position:0%
um uh reinforce that so much is
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
dependent on the the internal Town
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
politics and personalities whether a
 
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
project is difficult or easy just you
 
01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:12.299 align:start position:0%
know whether those individuals happen to
 
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
like it or not in their individual
 
01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
biases and that's not at all
 
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
standardized across the state my
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
question for you is the impact fees and
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
other fees that you uh spoke of isn't it
 
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
true that those are one-time fees
 
01:05:28.609 --> 01:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
um yes their one-time fees and follow up
 
01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
so it's fair to say that while those
 
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:34.140 align:start position:0%
affect the cost of housing for new
 
01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
developments that impact fees don't at
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
all explain the explosion in the cost of
 
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
housing for pre-existing structures
 
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:45.059 align:start position:0%
that's just one component of it but
 
01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
think about it this way if impact
 
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
feasible end time fee and it's 25 000
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
per unit the developer still needs to
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
pay that over his 20-year mortgage so
 
01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
he's paying interest on that impact me
 
01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
and he's paying it back principal a
 
01:05:59.690 --> 01:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
little bit at a time so yes it's a
 
01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:01.619 align:start position:0%
one-time fee up front at a town but
 
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
realistically we're paying for it for
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
the next 20 or 25 years
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm obviously including in my
 
01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.190 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm obviously including in my
statement

01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
structures that are 100 years old or
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
more that these structures have been in
 
01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
place before impact fees even existed
 
01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
and yet we see an increase in the cost
 
01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:20.819 align:start position:0%
of that housing as well so while I
 
01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:23.339 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a true cost for
 
01:06:24.829 --> 01:06:24.839 align:start position:0%
new developments I'm confirming it's
 
01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
that is only impacting new developments
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
and there are other factors that work
 
01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the housing market
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative Walsh thank
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks one last question on
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
impact fees again I thought only about
 
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
14 towns imposed impact fees do you know
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
that to be true
 
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
I don't have that information in my
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
disposal but I it's not many I don't
 
01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
believe I've developed in more than 14
 
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and I know that I've paid
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
more than
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
impact fees in each place that I've gone
 
01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
so if I follow up so the question I had
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
is assuming the number is still small I
 
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
thought it was 14 it might be more
 
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
um do the towns that don't have impact
 
01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.390 align:start position:0%
um do the towns that don't have impact
fees

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:07:08.089 --> 01:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
seek additional money for their impacts
 
01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
like more expensive building permits for
 
01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.410 align:start position:0%
like more expensive building permits for
example

01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:11.420 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
or do you think the towns that have
 
01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
impact fees are merely using them as a
 
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
as a deterrent
 
01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:18.770 align:start position:0%
as a deterrent
um

01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
we're extracted funds are extracted from
 
01:07:24.289 --> 01:07:24.299 align:start position:0%
us in a number of different ways let me
 
01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:27.299 align:start position:0%
give you for instance we built where we
 
01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
had water and sewer one time
 
01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
and they town did an assessment where
 
01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
they came and they said that
 
01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
our sewer pump system won't accept your
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
sewage because it's not big enough
 
01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
so we ended up building a second pump
 
01:07:45.289 --> 01:07:45.299 align:start position:0%
house with a full second pump to the
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
tune of three hundred thousand dollars
 
01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
which naturally was at our cost which
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
was then added to the cost of the
 
01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.910 align:start position:0%
was then added to the cost of the
housing

01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
whereas the town knew in advance that we
 
01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
weren't going to be able to add
 
01:07:59.569 --> 01:07:59.579 align:start position:0%
additional sewage to it because they
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
were already having problems and it
 
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
didn't accommodate what they were
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
already putting into it but we solved
 
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
their problem for them by putting in a
 
01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:08.579 align:start position:0%
whole nother pump which solved their
 
01:08:10.609 --> 01:08:10.619 align:start position:0%
initial problem not having to pay for it
 
01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:12.349 align:start position:0%
initial problem not having to pay for it
and

01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
um now they've got a brand new one as
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
well the amount of effluent that we put
 
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
into the new pump system that they put
 
01:08:23.329 --> 01:08:23.339 align:start position:0%
in was less than one percent of the
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
capacity of the pump station we were
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
forced to build
 
01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know I've been doing this 40 years
 
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
I'm on the downhill slide you know it
 
01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
used to be I wouldn't come here and
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
testify as it was out to the fact that I
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
had to continuously deal with the towns
 
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
at this point forward it doesn't really
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
make a difference to me what they think
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
because what I'm here to testify to is
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
it's a rightful or it's a right of every
 
01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire resident to have a clean
 
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
affordable house to live in that they
 
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
can afford
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
okay and I was developing affordable
 
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
housing when other people were
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
developing mcmansions and I wasn't
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
making anything doing it it was right
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
for my employees it was right for the
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
general public it was right for my
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
municipality I lived in to get some of
 
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
this stuff done that attitude doesn't
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
exist anymore
 
01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
if you look at the development Community
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
we're aging out
 
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
there aren't a lot of new developers
 
01:09:18.289 --> 01:09:18.299 align:start position:0%
coming online you know why because they
 
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
can't make a profit doing this and it's
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
such an artist process to get through
 
01:09:24.769 --> 01:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
people ask me why I don't sell them I
 
01:09:26.329 --> 01:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
don't sell them is because I put so much
 
01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
work on them because they become like a
 
01:09:30.289 --> 01:09:30.299 align:start position:0%
part of me like my children I wouldn't
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
sell my children I don't want to sell my
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
projects either I had to go through all
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
this time and effort to get there
 
01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
I'm keeping them I mean the development
 
01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:42.380 align:start position:0%
processes in there's women in the room
 
01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
and this is in a slight but anyway it's
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
like being pregnant okay
 
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
development you go through a lot of fun
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get it up and operating and
 
01:09:53.809 --> 01:09:53.819 align:start position:0%
made okay just like you have a lot of
 
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
fun preparing for a baby
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
then you go through the nine months of
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
carrying the child and that's your
 
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
development process and it gets worse
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
and it gets worse and it gets worse and
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
it gets worse until you actually have
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
the baby and then you forget everything
 
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
that you went through because the baby
 
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
is so charming and wonderful and you go
 
01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
back and you decide to do it again okay
 
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
well developing and building is like
 
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
going through pregnancy and labor okay
 
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
and then once the child is born and you
 
01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
see how good the job you did you want to
 
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
go back and do it again that's the
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
is quite the analogy I never thought
 
01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to use that or so thank
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
you if that's okay all right well I I
 
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for presenting to us I
 
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
think it's been very helpful and um if
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
the committee has questions we reach out
 
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
please you can reach out to me anytime
 
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
and be happy to come back I'd be happy
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
to take a call individually or provide
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
you with any information I can
 
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you very much
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna take a break well yeah let's
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
take a three minute break and then we'll
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
all right we are getting started I'm
 
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
hoping the committee will come back to
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%

audience we have some folks here in case
 
01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
people have other questions uh after the
 
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
fact and it is from our Communications
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
and marketing
 
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.380 align:start position:0%

really smart people with a lot of
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
information that we can rely on as a
 
01:17:58.010 --> 01:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
resource when you're doing your work so
 
01:17:59.930 --> 01:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
in light of New Hampshire housing's
 
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
report on the deficit of housing stock
 
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire we are really
 
01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
pleased to be before the community the
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee to tell you about an
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
overlooked housing sector that
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
represents seven percent of the um of
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing in or the housing
 
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire it's
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
affordable housing it's home ownership
 
01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
and its wealth building and it's
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing manufactured
 
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
housing that sits in a community that
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
the residents own the land underneath
 
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
and that's a distinguishing factor of
 
01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately this housing sector
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
is not overlooked by private Equity
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
investors from out of state who have
 
01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
made a huge push in the state of New
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire over I'd say probably the last
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
five years at least to buy up uh
 
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
communities and you'll see a little
 
01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
further in this presentation what
 
01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
happens when that happens can I just
 
01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
interrupt for one second so if you look
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
at the folders in the desk in front of
 
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
you we do have a slide presentation and
 
01:19:04.090 --> 01:19:04.100 align:start position:0%
the individual slides are available
 
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
right inside there so we can walk
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you sir I
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
appreciate that so so far you've only uh
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
missed the cover sheet so
 
01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
um one of the cool things about this is
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
that this is a really homegrown solution
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire created this solution the
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
legislature back in the 1980s made
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing real estate which
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
isn't common necessarily across the
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
United States and you also created an
 
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to purchase law that's
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
existed in New Hampshire since the 1980s
 
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
and is slowly happening across the
 
01:19:42.649 --> 01:19:42.659 align:start position:0%
United States and that opportunity to
 
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
purchase just means and representative
 
01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
McConkey can weigh in here if he wants
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
he has a lot of knowledge about this
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
that if the park goes up for sale and
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's a purchase and sale the
 
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
residents get to match that purchase and
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
sale price wise time wise condition wise
 
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
no no reduced benefit for the seller
 
01:20:04.209 --> 01:20:04.219 align:start position:0%
selling but the residents have to
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
participate in a commercially reasonable
 
01:20:10.630 --> 01:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
sale in order to by that Community
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
there is one of the real bonuses to that
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to purchase law is it
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
prevents a park closure which does
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
happen the land is bought residents are
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
given 18 months to move their homes and
 
01:20:26.159 --> 01:20:26.689 align:start position:0%
given 18 months to move their homes and
um

01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
that is not pretty uh this third slide
 
01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
in your um in your packet is a picture
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
of a woman named Joe Hayes who watched
 
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
as her neighbors in Hooksett New
 
01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at a community called Park
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
Place had their homes
 
01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
um scooped up by an excavator and put
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
into a dumpster because they couldn't
 
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
afford to move those homes if they were
 
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
even movable that's why we don't call
 
01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
them mobile homes anymore they're
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes by Statute here in
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
fact this happened probably 20 years ago
 
01:20:59.570 --> 01:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
the site in Hooksett still exists with
 
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
nothing on it so these people all were
 
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
dislocated uh none of them actually
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
um ended up keeping their most of them
 
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
did not keep their homes and there's
 
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
nothing there since but we will look at
 
01:21:14.930 --> 01:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
the resident ownership in the
 
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
affordability into perpetuity and
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
contrast this with an investor-owned
 
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
Park in the upcoming slides so
 
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
um resident owned communities as I
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned Community Loan Fund kind of
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
pioneered this concept starting in
 
01:21:31.370 --> 01:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
Meredith with a little Community there
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
back in the 1980s and you'll see in your
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
packet also a nationwide slide this has
 
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
spread across the nation there are 146
 
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
resident owned communities in New
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now that represents
 
01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
almost 9 000 affordable housing
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
households that have been preserved here
 
01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:53.219 align:start position:0%
in the in the state of New Hampshire and
 
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of partners that we've
 
01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:57.260 align:start position:0%
worked with along the way to do that
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
lenders who have seen this as a really
 
01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
great opportunity and all kinds of other
 
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
partners that have helped us improve uh
 
01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.450 align:start position:0%
partners that have helped us improve uh
infrastructure

01:22:08.450 --> 01:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:11.590 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
um

01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
so in this structure that's created is
 
01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
it's a consumer Cooperative that the
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
residents form it is a not-for-profit
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
corporation the residents still own
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
their house as they always have they
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
form the consumer Cooperative under RSA
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
301a and jointly by the land underneath
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
it so nobody owns a little square it's
 
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
not a condo where you own one forty
 
01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
third of a piece or anything like that
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
the The Cooperative that corporation
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
owns that um that property they elect a
 
01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
board they make their rules they set
 
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
their rent prices they have membership
 
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
criteria for who moves into that
 
01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
community criminal background and credit
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
generally and the Community Loan Fund
 
01:22:55.850 --> 01:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
stays with them we're not just a lender
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
to help facilitate that process but we
 
01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
also provide them technical assistance
 
01:23:03.169 --> 01:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
on how to run this new multi-million
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
dollar corporation that they own in fact
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
we stick with them for the 20-year life
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the own longer if they want through a
 
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
contract and we provide about 20 000
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
hours of technical assistance each year
 
01:23:19.130 --> 01:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
to the communities
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
and so what is the manufactured home
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that we're all
 
01:23:23.689 --> 01:23:23.699 align:start position:0%
starting from the same place a
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
manufactured home is defined by State
 
01:23:28.729 --> 01:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
Statute and they have a HUD set building
 
01:23:30.649 --> 01:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
code so Housing and Urban Development
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
code they're not modular and they're not
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
mobile they come in on a chassis they
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
are delivered and then they are they are
 
01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
zip tied not zip tied they are tied down
 
01:23:44.209 --> 01:23:44.219 align:start position:0%
in place and they are very expensive to
 
01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
move once they are set in place they are
 
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
not meant to move this is a permanent
 
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.219 align:start position:0%
housing option and it's an asset
 
01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
building home
 
01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
it's the beauty of a resident owned
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
Community is you're also part of a park
 
01:23:58.010 --> 01:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
you're part of a community and I do want
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
to mention Steve varnum who's part of
 
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
our Communications team is a member owns
 
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
a home in a manufactured home community
 
01:24:06.169 --> 01:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
and is part of one of our rocks and so
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
he's also here to answer questions
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
directly about that but they are they
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
have a very high quality construction
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
that HUD code has been updated and since
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
the head code was put in place they are
 
01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:20.219 align:start position:0%
not they are highly regulated they're
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
built inside of factories and the waste
 
01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
in the process of building one
 
01:24:26.930 --> 01:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
manufactured home that's in a 60 gallon
 
01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
trash can so they are super efficient
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
ways of building a home and they are
 
01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:33.719 align:start position:0%
constructed inside they're also
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
constructed to move and so they have to
 
01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
be a very well constructed piece of
 
01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:41.810 align:start position:0%
be a very well constructed piece of
housing

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:43.790 align:start position:0%
housing
um

01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
and moving on so the next is there's 146
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
resident owned communities in New
 
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you can see on that map that
 
01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
they are all over New Hampshire
 
01:24:55.010 --> 01:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
um and a little over nine thousand about
 
01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
nine thousand households has Tara had
 
01:24:57.060 --> 01:24:57.830 align:start position:0%
nine thousand households has Tara had
said

01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that we do income
 
01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
surveys they are their income surveys
 
01:25:04.729 --> 01:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
that the residents fill out when they go
 
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
through the process of converting to a
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
residential community in about 75 of the
 
01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
residents who own homes and rocks have
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
make 80 percent of the area of median
 
01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
income or less so these are truly an
 
01:25:18.770 --> 01:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
affordable housing option
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
and they cover the entire breadth of New
 
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in addition this model has
 
01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
been successful at preserving affordable
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
housing and the next slide shows you
 
01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
that there are now resident owned
 
01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
communities across the country out of
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund
 
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
and the model set by the state of New
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the legislature in our
 
01:25:42.649 --> 01:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
60-day notice rule Rock USA was born
 
01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
which has grown and it has about 150
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
communities Nationwide and growing as
 
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
well and so this is a model that has was
 
01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
grown right here in New Hampshire and
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
that has spurned Innovation across the
 
01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.330 align:start position:0%
that has spurned Innovation across the
country

01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:25:58.370 --> 01:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the next slide it's
 
01:26:01.129 --> 01:26:01.139 align:start position:0%
Equity Exeter rock you can see some of
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
the size variation in our resident owned
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
communities this one in Exeter is almost
 
01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
400 housing units and we have one
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
um not far from here that is our
 
01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:12.780 align:start position:0%
smallest rock there's only four housing
 
01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
units so they really cover the gamut of
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
sizes and styles and it definitely can
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
be some of the smaller models of housing
 
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
as we you were talking with your last
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
guest about
 
01:26:25.729 --> 01:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
they're also um we tend to find that
 
01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
they locate in different areas for
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
example in Exeter there's over 500 homes
 
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
in Resident owned communities spread
 
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
over five different resident owned
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
communities and in Rochester there's
 
01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
almost 700 residential housing units in
 
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
Resident owned communities spread over
 
01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
quite a number of them what I would like
 
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
to point out since you're asking
 
01:26:46.729 --> 01:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
questions about zoning and regulations
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
earlier is that I believe in both of
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
these communities they most of these
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
were put in before zoning and it doesn't
 
01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
mean that just because they're zoned
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
today and I think if you look at the
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
zoning map the areas that would allow
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing will be exactly
 
01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:03.719 align:start position:0%
where they exist and the boundaries will
 
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
not be any larger than where this type
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
of housing currently exists and so
 
01:27:10.129 --> 01:27:10.139 align:start position:0%
zoning is a big part of what we talk
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
about when we think about solutions to
 
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
the future of affordable housing so just
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
is that is that the biggest
 
01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
impediment to this development or are
 
01:27:22.129 --> 01:27:22.139 align:start position:0%
there other ones as well as far as new
 
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
development new development so I think
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
it um and I'll and I can touch a little
 
01:27:28.129 --> 01:27:28.139 align:start position:0%
bit more on that so zoning is absolutely
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
an impediment New Hampshire again
 
01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
um requires that all communities allow
 
01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
for manufactured housing where a
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
single-family home is allowed much like
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units there's many
 
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
ways that you can say it's required but
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
you don't actually make it possible to
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
build and
 
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
um and that could be if you require two
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
acre zoning the affordability of a
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
manufactured home right it goes down
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
significantly if the state law also
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
defines a manufactured housing Parks but
 
01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
it gives again communities the ability
 
01:28:02.090 --> 01:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
to say if you want to build a
 
01:28:03.649 --> 01:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Park but you
 
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
require two acre zoning and you don't
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
allow for the density that makes it
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
affordable then new parks can't exist
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
today so zoning is a one of the
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
impediments I think for creating new
 
01:28:17.930 --> 01:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing in Parks it's the
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
same cost of building a new road running
 
01:28:23.149 --> 01:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
water and sewer or coming or putting in
 
01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
well and septic and we have parks in
 
01:28:27.649 --> 01:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
very rural areas on well and septic
 
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
systems but to do those new costs today
 
01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
you have to spread that out over the
 
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
number of homes and it's the same math
 
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
that dick was doing and it is the same
 
01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:40.139 align:start position:0%
problem the beauty of it is that I think
 
01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
we have a pretty phenomenal model about
 
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
what density can look like but provides
 
01:28:49.729 --> 01:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
an affordable option but those areas are
 
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
largely completely built out because we
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
only have the zoning to reflect what's
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
on the ground and it has been
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
eliminated or significantly reduced from
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
allowing these Eric these to be built in
 
01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
the future there are I we know of one
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
that was recently built and I think or
 
01:29:07.129 --> 01:29:07.139 align:start position:0%
approved probably the first one in over
 
01:29:08.930 --> 01:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
20 years in Wolfeboro because there's
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
resident Community there that they've
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
seen the success with and they will
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
throw recently approve one as they need
 
01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
affordable home ownership options we
 
01:29:18.050 --> 01:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
also just heard that Litchfield might
 
01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
have just approved a new one but again
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
these are the first in more than 20
 
01:29:25.010 --> 01:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
years and highly highly rare
 
01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:28.139 align:start position:0%
as an option thank you
 
01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
um the next slide you'll see after the
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
Rochester one would very Cooperative in
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth does
 
01:29:37.129 --> 01:29:37.139 align:start position:0%
um is is a good example of how we can
 
01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
continue to make some progress with more
 
01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
affordable housing there's probably 300
 
01:29:46.610 --> 01:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
vacant Lots in rocks on Statewide and
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
because they're already approved parks
 
01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
and the density is already approved a
 
01:29:53.410 --> 01:29:53.420 align:start position:0%
home can be replaced so as an older
 
01:29:56.450 --> 01:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
pre-1970 model home which wasn't built
 
01:29:59.090 --> 01:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
to the specifications they are now it
 
01:30:01.729 --> 01:30:01.739 align:start position:0%
fails it can we can put a new home in
 
01:30:04.610 --> 01:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
there this Woodbury Cooperative slide in
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
here that was true in Woodbury there
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
were some um deserted wooden buildings
 
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
there and some homes that needed to be
 
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
removed we just are in the process of
 
01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
putting six homes in here in downtown
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth radon Woodbury Ave improving
 
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
a lot of water infrastructure and um and
 
01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
access for safety vehicles but this
 
01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
represents a home you can Buy in
 
01:30:30.530 --> 01:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth New Hampshire for less than
 
01:30:32.689 --> 01:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand dollars right now
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
which is pretty remarkable
 
01:30:35.159 --> 01:30:36.110 align:start position:0%
which is pretty remarkable
um

01:30:36.110 --> 01:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
let's talk about manufactured home
 
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
owners for just a minute that slide is
 
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
um uh in there next to the after the
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
Woodbury one just as dick antagnos was
 
01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
just saying the people who live in these
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing parks are essential
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
workers they're people you see every day
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
they're people that you work with and
 
01:30:59.209 --> 01:30:59.219 align:start position:0%
and it caters to a certain a certain
 
01:31:01.370 --> 01:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
population other than that income level
 
01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
of it being an affordable house as you
 
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
can see on the slide the statistics for
 
01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:08.219 align:start position:0%
people who are 65 and older high school
 
01:31:11.450 --> 01:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
education veterans and disabled it is a
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
smartly designed one-story home that you
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
can get in and out of very easy to ramp
 
01:31:18.169 --> 01:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
so it makes sense for all of those
 
01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
purposes but people from all walks of
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
life live in manufactured housing here
 
01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
in Loudon New Hampshire a former police
 
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
officer is the president of that
 
01:31:28.370 --> 01:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
Association there we have three
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
different communities where the town tax
 
01:31:32.689 --> 01:31:32.699 align:start position:0%
collector lives in there in that
 
01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
Community their nursing home employees
 
01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
nurses at nursing homes teaches exactly
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
as you heard and it's not surprising
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
that it is not only affordable but it's
 
01:31:46.490 --> 01:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
a it's a smart floor plan so let's just
 
01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
look a little bit more at the
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
affordability we just mentioned what you
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
could buy a house in Portsmouth for this
 
01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
is the most affordable housing option in
 
01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire whether it's rental or
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
home ownership in fact it's easier it's
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
cheaper to live in manufactured housing
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
that you're buying that it is to rent
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
the comparable two-bedroom apartment in
 
01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
the same area this first slide here just
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
shows you what rents um the difference
 
01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
between the payments in various parts of
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for a mortgage payment for
 
01:32:20.290 --> 01:32:20.300 align:start position:0%
a conventional home renting an apartment
 
01:32:24.410 --> 01:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
and they um manufactured home the next
 
01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
one the next slide manufactured home in
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
a rock that shows you a recent home just
 
01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
bought in Guilford New Hampshire the
 
01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
purchase price there are um for this
 
01:32:37.370 --> 01:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
income level of buyer lots of homeowner
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
Assistance programs and housing loan
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
trust money that can help with a down
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
payment for the house and this is an
 
01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
actual transaction it includes the
 
01:32:50.290 --> 01:32:50.300 align:start position:0%
mortgage payment the taxes the insurance
 
01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
and the monthly lot rent you see which
 
01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
is 325 down near the bottom the total
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
monthly housing cost for this home is
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
um 1257 this is a two bedroom two
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
bathroom that the owner is going to
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
Bill's wealth build equity in and at
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
some point sell that
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
um it in the bedrooms are on each end of
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
the home so it really works out well for
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
a parent and children or even roommates
 
01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
in this it's a it's a really great
 
01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:20.930 align:start position:0%
in this it's a it's a really great
layout

01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
layout
 
01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:22.139 align:start position:0%
um the next slide I'm sorry these are
 
01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:24.300 align:start position:0%
two bedrooms that's a two bedroom that
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
specifically was one you can get up to
 
01:33:28.129 --> 01:33:28.139 align:start position:0%
four bedrooms they go as small as one
 
01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
bedroom and up to four bedrooms okay so
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
this is this this one that we're looking
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
at is the two bedroom unit okay it's a
 
01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
two bedroom home two bedroom two bath
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty consistent these
 
01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
prices like Statewide yeah the the ones
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
at Fort Smith uh we only had room for
 
01:33:44.090 --> 01:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
one two bedroom home the others are one
 
01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
bedroom there that one will be a little
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh less expensive than the two bedroom
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
one there uh the next slide on the
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
average new home sales price we don't we
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
don't need to tell you that I'm sure
 
01:33:55.850 --> 01:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
this committee has heard the average
 
01:33:57.770 --> 01:33:57.780 align:start position:0%
price of a single family home in New
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is um is way over 400 000 now
 
01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
and that's a monthly mortgage payment of
 
01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:04.570 align:start position:0%
and that's a monthly mortgage payment of
about

01:34:04.570 --> 01:34:04.580 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
3151 the average price of a manufactured
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
home 123 200 and that's gone up just
 
01:34:14.209 --> 01:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
recently with the uh with the market
 
01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
that's happening so manufactured home
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
savings on average compared to renting
 
01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
um about 320 three dollars less per
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
month about thirty eight hundred and
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
seventy six dollars uh a year
 
01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
and um I think we're gonna switch over
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
so I'll jump in here so um you're
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
looking at a graph with a huge blue
 
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
swath on the next page
 
01:34:39.290 --> 01:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
um this is a study done by Rock USA
 
01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:40.380 align:start position:0%
which does include New Hampshire
 
01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
communities I said well and it looks at
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
the change in cost over time that
 
01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
they've seen from an investor-owned
 
01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
Community versus a resident owned
 
01:34:51.229 --> 01:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
community in lot increases lot rent
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
increase and on average nationally we're
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
looking at just under a four percent
 
01:34:59.450 --> 01:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
increase in lot rent over year over year
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
in an investor-owned community and it's
 
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
less than one percent in a resident
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
owned community so if you flip to the
 
01:35:06.649 --> 01:35:06.659 align:start position:0%
next page what does that mean right
 
01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
that's not the easiest chart to read so
 
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
the benefits of home ownership is after
 
01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
10 years of living in a resident-owned
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
community on average your rent will be a
 
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a month less than in an
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
investor community and that's a national
 
01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:20.930 align:start position:0%
investor community and that's a national
average

01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
average
 
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
um if you've flipped to the next page
 
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's twelve hundred dollars a year every
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
year in rent being less and you can
 
01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
really see that difference we do in the
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
next page talk about
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
how residents are really working
 
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
together to buy their parks and to save
 
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
them from investor type ownership where
 
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
they're they just don't have the same
 
01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
option and control over their rent you
 
01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
can understand why these would be
 
01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
attractive to large hedge funds and
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
investor owners because if they're not
 
01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
concerned about affordable housing and
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
asset building they can come in and
 
01:35:55.610 --> 01:35:55.620 align:start position:0%
raise rent and they can raise rent and
 
01:35:58.209 --> 01:35:58.219 align:start position:0%
there's little that the average
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
homeowner can do in an investor-owned
 
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
community and so the next shows an
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
article from The New Yorker this has
 
01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
been acknowledged nationally as a
 
01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
growing problem that and about a third
 
01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.390 align:start position:0%
growing problem that and about a third
of

01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:36:13.129 --> 01:36:13.139 align:start position:0%
um manufactured
 
01:36:15.890 --> 01:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
form communities across the country
 
01:36:18.410 --> 01:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
since 2015 have been bought by large
 
01:36:21.229 --> 01:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
investor buyers so fewer and fewer are
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
owned by our local Mom and Pops we still
 
01:36:25.729 --> 01:36:25.739 align:start position:0%
have some here in New Hampshire and and
 
01:36:27.169 --> 01:36:27.179 align:start position:0%
while the resident owned communities
 
01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
movement is growing it is going to take
 
01:36:31.729 --> 01:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of work to really secure these
 
01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:33.179 align:start position:0%
types of affordable housing in
 
01:36:33.179 --> 01:36:35.209 align:start position:0%
types of affordable housing in
perpetuity

01:36:35.209 --> 01:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
perpetuity
 
01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
looking at maintaining affordability a
 
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
recent article in the Laconia Daily Sun
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
right here in New Hampshire is talking
 
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
about an investor-owned community in um
 
01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
in called Great Brook and in Belmont
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
thank you so great book excuse me Great
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
Brook in Belmont
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
um and here's some quotes directly from
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
that newspaper article somebody was
 
01:36:58.850 --> 01:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
buying a home in this park when they
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
signed they agreed to buy a home the lot
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
rent was 6 18 by the time they closed 30
 
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
days later the lot rent had increased to
 
01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
691 and they just got another notice
 
01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
that the lot run is going up to 746. so
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
in an investor-owned Community that's
 
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
over a hundred and thirty dollar
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
increase in less than a year and that's
 
01:37:21.770 --> 01:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
the reality of what can happen in
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
investor-owned communities in New
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or anywhere and so that's why
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
the resident owned Community model is so
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
strong because the residents vote when
 
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
to increase their rent and those
 
01:37:34.250 --> 01:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
increases go based on infrastructure
 
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
improvements right based on actual costs
 
01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
that the board and the residents are
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
um so lastly the takeaways that we want
 
01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
you um to take away from this
 
01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:49.860 align:start position:0%
presentation is manufactured housing is
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
the most affordable housing option in
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire renting or owning it is
 
01:37:57.649 --> 01:37:57.659 align:start position:0%
the lower of any of those uh options
 
01:37:59.330 --> 01:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Community Loan funds
 
01:38:01.729 --> 01:38:01.739 align:start position:0%
Park conversion and mortgage programs we
 
01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:04.139 align:start position:0%
Finance those homes that people are
 
01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
buying there is a really important part
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
of the affordable housing solution here
 
01:38:12.050 --> 01:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and we've
 
01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
been doing this for 40 years now and
 
01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
have gone from needless to say a hundred
 
01:38:21.110 --> 01:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
communities in the early 2000s quickly
 
01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
to 146 today with three more in the
 
01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
queue right now we still have plenty of
 
01:38:29.209 --> 01:38:29.219 align:start position:0%
work to do not just in the residents
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
interested in acquiring their Parks but
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
in helping them maintain the parks and
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
um and the technical assistance that we
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
provide we're really grateful for the
 
01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
Forward Thinking of the New Hampshire
 
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
legislature back then but it's really
 
01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
something that we need to protect it's
 
01:38:46.610 --> 01:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
not something that we take for granted
 
01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to purchase law there
 
01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
have been efforts to lessen the ability
 
01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
of the residents to take advantage of
 
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
that right especially over the last
 
01:38:57.410 --> 01:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
couple of years so we really need to
 
01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
protect and enhance those laws
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
and last takeaway the resident owned
 
01:39:05.209 --> 01:39:05.219 align:start position:0%
communities provide housing stability
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
but they also and they are not dependent
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
on any state or local funding right so
 
01:39:12.110 --> 01:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
this is true affordable home ownership
 
01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
that is naturally occurring across the
 
01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:15.350 align:start position:0%
that is naturally occurring across the
state

01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
um and that there's very very few
 
01:39:20.090 --> 01:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
opportunities for home ownership
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
affordability that does not require
 
01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:23.870 align:start position:0%
affordability that does not require
subsidy

01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
subsidy
 
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
um in large part
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
we do think zoning is a key part of the
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
future here we need more resident owned
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
communities we would love to see new
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
communities built with new housing like
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth bringing in brand new
 
01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
homes into communities is is incredibly
 
01:39:42.290 --> 01:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
important and it uplifts the communities
 
01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
these models not only Empower people to
 
01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
be able to learn a lot of the leadership
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
skills and the skills about running it's
 
01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
essentially almost like a small
 
01:39:52.729 --> 01:39:52.739 align:start position:0%
municipality right I mean you have a
 
01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements plan you have
 
01:39:55.729 --> 01:39:55.739 align:start position:0%
infrastructure improvements you're
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
navigating all of this it teaches real
 
01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
skills that people are using to grow
 
01:40:02.209 --> 01:40:02.219 align:start position:0%
themselves and to be a better part of
 
01:40:04.090 --> 01:40:04.100 align:start position:0%
our community and economy going forward
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
but we do
 
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
we do have factors that prohibit new
 
01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
communities from being formed or even
 
01:40:13.250 --> 01:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
existing communities that we have that
 
01:40:15.770 --> 01:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
have land from expanding and a lot of
 
01:40:18.370 --> 01:40:18.380 align:start position:0%
that has to do with minimum lot sizes
 
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
parking requirements
 
01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
um and and other barriers within
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
communities just like nimbyism any type
 
01:40:29.450 --> 01:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
of housing we fight nimbyism here in New
 
01:40:31.010 --> 01:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but that is certainly a
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
problem with our resident owned
 
01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
communities and the creation of new
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
affordable home ownership options
 
01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
and with that um we do have some
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
Partners in the room I'd just like to
 
01:40:42.290 --> 01:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
acknowledge too New Hampshire housing
 
01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
makes a huge part of our welcome home
 
01:40:47.149 --> 01:40:47.159 align:start position:0%
loan team contributions as well they
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
provide some of the down payment
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
assistance that Tara mentioned and cdfa
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
and some of the other partners across
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
the state with infrastructure
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
improvements to our resident owned
 
01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:57.110 align:start position:0%
improvements to our resident owned
communities

01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:40:59.629 --> 01:40:59.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'd love to get um
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
specific I know this I would like to get
 
01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:03.169 align:start position:0%
specific I know this I would like to get
specific

01:41:03.169 --> 01:41:03.179 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:41:05.930 --> 01:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
um barriers that are put in place by
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities like you mentioned Park
 
01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to get kind of a list of
 
01:41:11.209 --> 01:41:11.219 align:start position:0%
those things so we can look at that of
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
course absolutely I'd also Point um we
 
01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
can also point you to the new New
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire zoning Atlas project you can
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
see right on there there's a toggle for
 
01:41:19.490 --> 01:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes and manufactured
 
01:41:20.930 --> 01:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
where they can be built and you'd be
 
01:41:22.729 --> 01:41:22.739 align:start position:0%
it's less than 10 that allows
 
01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes on small Lots great
 
01:41:27.229 --> 01:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna go around so represent
 
01:41:27.239 --> 01:41:28.610 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna go around so represent
Walsh

01:41:28.610 --> 01:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
Walsh
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming and thanks for the
 
01:41:35.209 --> 01:41:35.219 align:start position:0%
presentation uh full disclosure I love
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes I used to live for a
 
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
short period in Country Lane Manor in
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
Candia mom and pop but it was great I
 
01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
wish I had never left I made the mistake
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
of buying a house
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
um but my name is Thomas Welsh from
 
01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:50.990 align:start position:0%
um but my name is Thomas Welsh from
Hooksett

01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
Hooksett
 
01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
and up until three weeks ago I was the
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
chairman on the planning board so if
 
01:41:57.050 --> 01:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
you're going to use Hooksett as a
 
01:41:59.330 --> 01:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
horrific example I just want to clarify
 
01:42:01.729 --> 01:42:01.739 align:start position:0%
exactly what happened it was only about
 
01:42:04.090 --> 01:42:04.100 align:start position:0%
six to eight years ago actually
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
and the park had been there since I can
 
01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
remember and I'm almost 60. it was
 
01:42:11.090 --> 01:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
beyond blighted it was actually
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
condemnable but the town never did
 
01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
anything to those people we have no
 
01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
issue with them no no it wasn't that
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
town a developer came in out of state
 
01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:19.970 align:start position:0%
town a developer came in out of state
developer

01:42:19.970 --> 01:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
developer
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
and wanted to put up two apartment
 
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
buildings we said fine we know the
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
people can't afford the place are you
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
going to give us a guarantee that they
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
have an option for these affordable
 
01:42:30.590 --> 01:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
apartments and they said yes
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
I said did we say the only other thing
 
01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
we want is right on Route 3 that's our
 
01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
commercial District give us a couple
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
we'll give you the mix used you can do
 
01:42:40.129 --> 01:42:40.139 align:start position:0%
your two buildings just reserve some
 
01:42:44.209 --> 01:42:44.219 align:start position:0%
some modest commercial on Route 3 itself
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
they ignored us they came back with
 
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
three giant buildings with underground
 
01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
parking and everything else and that's
 
01:42:53.090 --> 01:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
and then and when we said no that's not
 
01:42:54.590 --> 01:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
what we asked you and they never came
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
back we were not the deterrents we were
 
01:42:58.370 --> 01:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
actually trying to help that area
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
just to be clear uh those people also
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
had 18 months it's unfortunate that it
 
01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
had to happen but state law gives them
 
01:43:07.609 --> 01:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
18 months to find other other uh
 
01:43:10.729 --> 01:43:10.739 align:start position:0%
places to live and you are correct none
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
of those would have survived going over
 
01:43:15.169 --> 01:43:15.179 align:start position:0%
the road that's just a situation we're
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
in so again
 
01:43:19.609 --> 01:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
I have to defend my town when I see it
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
being used as a horrific example of
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
something really mean it's not how it
 
01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:24.229 align:start position:0%
something really mean it's not how it
happened

01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:43:25.729 --> 01:43:25.739 align:start position:0%
I do have one question though Mr chair
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
if I can yes question
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
um I Heard recently the EPA is also
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
going to be increasing the the
 
01:43:33.770 --> 01:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
requirements of Energy Efficiency in
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
mobile homes
 
01:43:37.129 --> 01:43:37.139 align:start position:0%
do you have you heard of that and do you
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
know how much that's going to increase
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
the price of them I don't think it's
 
01:43:42.290 --> 01:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
necessary but what say you so there have
 
01:43:45.169 --> 01:43:45.179 align:start position:0%
been proposals and they're it's open for
 
01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:46.940 align:start position:0%
comment right now
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
the the current manufactured housing is
 
01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
a far cry from the older manufactured
 
01:43:56.209 --> 01:43:56.219 align:start position:0%
housing but I I don't think the public
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
is generally well educated about what
 
01:44:00.970 --> 01:44:00.980 align:start position:0%
the quality of manufactured housing is
 
01:44:04.129 --> 01:44:04.139 align:start position:0%
we have been doing some
 
01:44:07.570 --> 01:44:07.580 align:start position:0%
um investigating of if in fact there are
 
01:44:11.290 --> 01:44:11.300 align:start position:0%
requirements or funds available about
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
heat pumps and things like that to keep
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
people from relying on kerosene and
 
01:44:18.010 --> 01:44:18.020 align:start position:0%
things like that from the heating so
 
01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:20.820 align:start position:0%
lots of room for improvement here in New
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where we're really focused I
 
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
haven't I don't think the change to
 
01:44:28.609 --> 01:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
efficiency standards has got much legs
 
01:44:30.649 --> 01:44:30.659 align:start position:0%
now but it's hard to tell from a comment
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
period the manufactured housing industry
 
01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
and the Builders of manufactured housing
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
Clayton Homes have a very strong
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
presence and they're actually a
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful manufacturer they're doing a
 
01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
lot of innovative things with their
 
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
homes down so we're watching it we're
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
aware of it but so far we're trying to
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
figure out what works best for New
 
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.490 align:start position:0%
figure out what works best for New
Hampshire

01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah I'm just concerned because
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
obviously it defeats the purpose if the
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
price of this thing keeps climbing
 
01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
um just for while you're watching it too
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
heat pumps in New Hampshire yeah not
 
01:45:01.490 --> 01:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
always what they're cut out to be once
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
it gets below 20 degrees so you know
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:45:11.209 --> 01:45:11.219 align:start position:0%
um and uh welcome to the committee thank
 
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
you for coming uh
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
I'm also on the Commerce Committee
 
01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
um and a few weeks ago uh there was a
 
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
bill before the Commerce Committee on a
 
01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
complaint process for the residents of
 
01:45:29.209 --> 01:45:29.219 align:start position:0%
mobile uh sorry manufactured housing
 
01:45:29.219 --> 01:45:32.030 align:start position:0%
mobile uh sorry manufactured housing
parks

01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
um I think I said earlier I I worked for
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
HUD for 29 years and they changed the
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
statute from a statute on mobile homes
 
01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
to a statute on manufactured housing and
 
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
we all had to correct our terminology
 
01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
but our tongues don't always cooperate
 
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh anyway
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
um uh a resident of a resident owned
 
01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:54.350 align:start position:0%
um uh a resident of a resident owned
Park

01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
Park
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
um uh testified before the Commerce
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
Committee very very upset almost in
 
01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:00.950 align:start position:0%
Committee very very upset almost in
tears

01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
tears
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
um about problems she and some of the
 
01:46:06.050 --> 01:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
other residents were having with the
 
01:46:08.090 --> 01:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
management of the resident owned Park
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
and particularly how they were handling
 
01:46:12.169 --> 01:46:12.179 align:start position:0%
the parks funds
 
01:46:15.770 --> 01:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
um and as I understand it they had a
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
loan from the New Hampshire Community
 
01:46:19.609 --> 01:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund
 
01:46:24.649 --> 01:46:24.659 align:start position:0%
um but she was very dissatisfied
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
um with the technical assistance that
 
01:46:30.649 --> 01:46:30.659 align:start position:0%
was being provided now the Commerce
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
Committee has a lot of builds and I
 
01:46:35.209 --> 01:46:35.219 align:start position:0%
don't have all the details uh memorized
 
01:46:37.729 --> 01:46:37.739 align:start position:0%
I was just trying to find my notes
 
01:46:37.739 --> 01:46:38.750 align:start position:0%
I was just trying to find my notes
um

01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
on that on that hearing but I actually
 
01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
don't think I have them with me
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
um uh but she was saying essentially
 
01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:47.570 align:start position:0%
um uh but she was saying essentially
that

01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
um she thought that they would get
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
assistance from the Community Loan Fund
 
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
but that they weren't getting the
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
assistance that she expected now it
 
01:46:59.450 --> 01:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
seemed um and again I don't have all the
 
01:47:02.570 --> 01:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
details in my head that in fact
 
01:47:04.729 --> 01:47:04.739 align:start position:0%
um the uh the bill really wasn't
 
01:47:06.890 --> 01:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
necessary because there is an existing
 
01:47:10.669 --> 01:47:10.679 align:start position:0%
uh complaint board for for residents of
 
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Parks
 
01:47:16.609 --> 01:47:16.619 align:start position:0%
um but my question is
 
01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
um uh have you heard anything about that
 
01:47:21.169 --> 01:47:21.179 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't know if there was
 
01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
anybody from the Community Loan Fund at
 
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
that hearing
 
01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
um and can you tell us how the Community
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund deals with complaints that you
 
01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.450 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund deals with complaints that you
receive

01:47:32.450 --> 01:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
receive
 
01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Gibbs I was
 
01:47:36.590 --> 01:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
here I was present for that um that
 
01:47:38.450 --> 01:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
hearing and that same person has
 
01:47:40.850 --> 01:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
testified in in several other
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
um hearings with those complaints
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
um we work a lot with the board of that
 
01:47:48.530 --> 01:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
community that person isn't a member of
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
the board as a matter of fact they've
 
01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
been in existence since 2019 and we've
 
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
spent just shy of 8 000 hours of
 
01:47:58.250 --> 01:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
technical assistance with that Community
 
01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
um dealing with a succession of three
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
different boards uh Each of which
 
01:48:04.850 --> 01:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
thought the other one did a crappy job
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
of running the community so we are
 
01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
working through that that individual
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
contacts uh attends the the monthly
 
01:48:15.410 --> 01:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
board meetings and there's a time for
 
01:48:18.770 --> 01:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
questions at the end and sometimes the
 
01:48:20.689 --> 01:48:20.699 align:start position:0%
answers aren't what that person is
 
01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
hoping so we we work with the boards the
 
01:48:25.970 --> 01:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
governance of those Community we really
 
01:48:28.729 --> 01:48:28.739 align:start position:0%
don't work with referring individual
 
01:48:28.739 --> 01:48:30.109 align:start position:0%
don't work with referring individual
members

01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:48:33.649 --> 01:48:33.659 align:start position:0%
um disputes between members but the bill
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
that you're referring to the um that
 
01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
would either save the manufactured
 
01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
housing board that exists or create a
 
01:48:44.090 --> 01:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
new one which is another possibility
 
01:48:46.370 --> 01:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
that the Commerce Committee has looked
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
at we have been involved with that and
 
01:48:52.129 --> 01:48:52.139 align:start position:0%
would are willing to work with them to
 
01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:54.179 align:start position:0%
make sure there's something in place for
 
01:48:56.209 --> 01:48:56.219 align:start position:0%
residents that can't necessarily go to
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
court to fix these disputes each time so
 
01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
well aware of it and um and um did
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
listen to that testimony
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:49:09.050 --> 01:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
um so aside from and I'm sure with every
 
01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
human undertaking there's going to be
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
problems and and conflict and so I don't
 
01:49:21.050 --> 01:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
know anything about the issues except to
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
say I'm sure that there always are
 
01:49:25.490 --> 01:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
issues but on a much broader level I
 
01:49:26.689 --> 01:49:26.699 align:start position:0%
just want to thank you for everything
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
that you do
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
um because as a committee when we talk
 
01:49:33.649 --> 01:49:33.659 align:start position:0%
about housing in general we tend to
 
01:49:36.729 --> 01:49:36.739 align:start position:0%
focus I I think too much on rental
 
01:49:40.490 --> 01:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
housing and truly truly what we really
 
01:49:43.609 --> 01:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
want is home ownership and an affordable
 
01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
home ownership because home ownership
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
not only I think we talk about NIMBY
 
01:49:50.570 --> 01:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
exclusionary zoning the purpose of which
 
01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:53.219 align:start position:0%
is to kind of if I may be so blunt to
 
01:49:55.850 --> 01:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
kind of keep certain types of people out
 
01:49:59.450 --> 01:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
maybe income level people and really
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
what we end up doing is having a high
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
rent housing
 
01:50:07.129 --> 01:50:07.139 align:start position:0%
that makes our communities more unstable
 
01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
which is worse than if we had had stable
 
01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
lower income people who owns their homes
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
and I think homeownership is such a key
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
level of Liberty and freedom for people
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
in the the uh underpinning of our entire
 
01:50:25.370 --> 01:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
economy so um having said all that thank
 
01:50:28.250 --> 01:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
you for for uh being like I think the
 
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
primary force for affordable home
 
01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:31.850 align:start position:0%
primary force for affordable home
ownership

01:50:31.850 --> 01:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
um is it yes sir there is yes Mr chair
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that the thing that
 
01:50:39.410 --> 01:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
got you started the thing that enabled
 
01:50:42.590 --> 01:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
this to happen was that original uh law
 
01:50:46.850 --> 01:50:46.860 align:start position:0%
passing in the 80s the 60-day notice
 
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
um which is not a right of first refusal
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
but a consider this offer fairly law
 
01:50:54.649 --> 01:50:54.659 align:start position:0%
correct correct and if I may just
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
quickly follow up across the country
 
01:50:58.370 --> 01:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
um especially recently because of
 
01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
housing costs across the country
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
um a bunch of co-ops that are not
 
01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing but multi-family
 
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
housing Etc I understand this is not
 
01:51:10.129 --> 01:51:10.139 align:start position:0%
your area of expertise in fact you all
 
01:51:11.810 --> 01:51:11.820 align:start position:0%
helped me when I reached out to you last
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
summer when I had a multi-family uh
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
house in my district that wanted to go
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
Co-op but is it also fair to say that if
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
we extended something similar to that to
 
01:51:24.050 --> 01:51:24.060 align:start position:0%
multi-family housing not just
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing that there would be
 
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
possibilities I know there's differences
 
01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
between manufacture housing parks and
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
multi-family housing but there would be
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
possibilities to increase homeownership
 
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
affordable home ownership for
 
01:51:38.930 --> 01:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
multi-family housing structures as well
 
01:51:41.930 --> 01:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
um we we have we have a model that works
 
01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
for sure it's been tried and tested we
 
01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
have lots of templates and processes and
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
policies and things like that
 
01:51:52.010 --> 01:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
um we would be more than happy to have a
 
01:51:54.609 --> 01:51:54.619 align:start position:0%
discussion about is that transferable to
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
multi-family and what needs to be
 
01:51:59.930 --> 01:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
tweaked to make that happen we we agree
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
that this is smart home ownership for
 
01:52:05.450 --> 01:52:05.460 align:start position:0%
people at a level that they can afford
 
01:52:07.729 --> 01:52:07.739 align:start position:0%
and be would be glad to see that that
 
01:52:10.010 --> 01:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
model spread thank you and I'll just
 
01:52:12.770 --> 01:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
have those conversations with you later
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
I think I'd like to add one of the
 
01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:16.139 align:start position:0%
things again that makes this affordable
 
01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
and both of those models I'm just going
 
01:52:20.570 --> 01:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
to go back to its density
 
01:52:22.609 --> 01:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
and and I just want to underscore how
 
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly important it is in this being
 
01:52:26.209 --> 01:52:26.219 align:start position:0%
an affordable home ownership model and
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
you're all set 100 all right great
 
01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I actually have
 
01:52:42.169 --> 01:52:42.179 align:start position:0%
a question without a long intro
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
so your your uh goal is to create these
 
01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
um opportunities for these people to buy
 
01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:53.149 align:start position:0%
um opportunities for these people to buy
these

01:52:53.149 --> 01:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
um these Parks
 
01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
um how do you have any numbers on how
 
01:53:03.709 --> 01:53:03.719 align:start position:0%
successful you have been like what are
 
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
the number of parks that have been sold
 
01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
versus the number of parks that have
 
01:53:10.010 --> 01:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
been sold into this kind of like home
 
01:53:12.530 --> 01:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
like the owner occupied kind of a thing
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
and so like is it 10 or 50 how
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
successful have you been so it is a
 
01:53:20.090 --> 01:53:20.100 align:start position:0%
great question we've been at it for 40
 
01:53:23.689 --> 01:53:23.699 align:start position:0%
years we think there's 450 parks
 
01:53:26.649 --> 01:53:26.659 align:start position:0%
thereabout in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:53:29.209 --> 01:53:29.219 align:start position:0%
146 of them a resident owned community
 
01:53:32.209 --> 01:53:32.219 align:start position:0%
so so far one third of them are resident
 
01:53:35.629 --> 01:53:35.639 align:start position:0%
owned but we work with a lot of groups
 
01:53:38.570 --> 01:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
or several groups yearly sometimes they
 
01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
decide they don't want to be resident
 
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
owned they would rather have somebody
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
else doing all the work and paying the
 
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
bills and not meeting us a board and
 
01:53:50.450 --> 01:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
um sometimes so that's one reason why we
 
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
work with somebody and they don't do it
 
01:53:53.810 --> 01:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
the residents just vote against it
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
another reason is the private Equity
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
money that we see come into the state
 
01:54:03.649 --> 01:54:03.659 align:start position:0%
that just will pay obscene amounts for
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
um for these Parks we worked with a
 
01:54:08.930 --> 01:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
community in Rochester this year that
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
the purchase price for the 300 there's
 
01:54:15.169 --> 01:54:15.179 align:start position:0%
about 325 homes existing development
 
01:54:17.149 --> 01:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
rates for more there but the purchase
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
price was 58 million dollars and that is
 
01:54:23.450 --> 01:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
just Way Beyond The Pale a residents
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
rent would have gone from 500 something
 
01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
to 900 a month in order to do that and
 
01:54:31.609 --> 01:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
private Equity money can afford to come
 
01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
and do that and unfortunately those
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
people will have nine dollar 900 lot
 
01:54:38.570 --> 01:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
rents at some point but it's just not a
 
01:54:41.689 --> 01:54:41.699 align:start position:0%
level that we can we can compete on and
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have a solution for that right
 
01:54:45.609 --> 01:54:45.619 align:start position:0%
now people that are just willing so
 
01:54:48.850 --> 01:54:48.860 align:start position:0%
that's a purchase price that went up to
 
01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
110 a unit uh it's got to be far before
 
01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
below that I think the most expensive
 
01:54:58.430 --> 01:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
we've done is 80 000 a unit uh this thus
 
01:55:01.090 --> 01:55:01.100 align:start position:0%
far so
 
01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
some some of those may come up for sale
 
01:55:05.930 --> 01:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
again and the residents get another
 
01:55:07.370 --> 01:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
chance at it
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
um we don't know but we every one that
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
we know of that comes up
 
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
um we work with the residents to give
 
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
them the option to do it and it's it's
 
01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:19.860 align:start position:0%
more than half I think that we work with
 
01:55:21.290 --> 01:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
that actually become resident owned
 
01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:22.609 align:start position:0%
that actually become resident owned
communities

01:55:22.609 --> 01:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative Waltz thank you Mr chair
 
01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh could you speak to um I believe
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
you're involved in the um Danville Four
 
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
Seasons conversion a few years ago and
 
01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
also in my town is cotton Farms so we've
 
01:55:38.209 --> 01:55:38.219 align:start position:0%
got the two opposite sides of the
 
01:55:40.609 --> 01:55:40.619 align:start position:0%
Spectrum which representative yukela
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
does also represent as well could you
 
01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
share with your involvement in those
 
01:55:47.930 --> 01:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
yeah a great great story and uh story
 
01:55:50.689 --> 01:55:50.699 align:start position:0%
um the the great story is uh Danville
 
01:55:52.609 --> 01:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
Four Seasons we uh they picked the name
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
Rock Rimmon as What the residents call
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
them uh were approached to by their
 
01:55:58.729 --> 01:55:58.739 align:start position:0%
Community a matching purchase and sale
 
01:56:01.729 --> 01:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
that was too high for them to afford and
 
01:56:03.649 --> 01:56:03.659 align:start position:0%
we actually had to say no the first time
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
and they were they were really really
 
01:56:09.770 --> 01:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
upset about that it came back a year
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
later that sale never went through so
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
maybe it wasn't even a real purchase and
 
01:56:15.290 --> 01:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
say oh we don't know it came back at
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
half the price the next year I think it
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
was actually two million dollars the
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
residents were really excited about that
 
01:56:23.330 --> 01:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
not only did they buy their Community
 
01:56:26.330 --> 01:56:26.340 align:start position:0%
they've done water and sewer and Paving
 
01:56:28.729 --> 01:56:28.739 align:start position:0%
and done unbelievably great things to
 
01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
the community which was formerly a
 
01:56:32.689 --> 01:56:32.699 align:start position:0%
campground at one point and a couple of
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
years ago we did a project with Harbor
 
01:56:39.410 --> 01:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
homes in Nashua put in 10 500 square
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
foot homes that are all now occupied
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
with formerly homeless veterans uh who
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
now have their own Community within this
 
01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
community and that is a bunch of really
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
hard-working people uh that have made an
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
incredible little Community uh for
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
themselves there and that's the huge
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
success story cotton Farm Village also
 
01:57:02.169 --> 01:57:02.179 align:start position:0%
in Danville
 
01:57:05.149 --> 01:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Park uh that had
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
some extra land uh there were some
 
01:57:09.530 --> 01:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
attempts for the residents to buy it a
 
01:57:11.629 --> 01:57:11.639 align:start position:0%
few a lot of years ago that fell through
 
01:57:14.209 --> 01:57:14.219 align:start position:0%
but since that time two big apartment
 
01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
buildings have also been located on that
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
same parcel to work with those groups we
 
01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
would probably have to work with them
 
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
with a manufactured housing Park and
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
figure out another plan for the
 
01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings but um that has an
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
investor owner that's from out of state
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
and we've tried to work with him because
 
01:57:35.089 --> 01:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
the residents would like to buy it it's
 
01:57:36.770 --> 01:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
not a great housing situation not only
 
01:57:39.290 --> 01:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
does the rent continuously go up when
 
01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
you get too far behind on your rent
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes that owner makes a deal with
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
you to just take your house and forget
 
01:57:48.649 --> 01:57:48.659 align:start position:0%
the rent and my last check of the
 
01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds six times
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
people had said okay I can't afford the
 
01:57:55.070 --> 01:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
background I'll just walk away here's a
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
deed to the house and then the owner
 
01:57:58.609 --> 01:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
subsequently just sells it to somebody
 
01:58:01.010 --> 01:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
else so they've stripped those folks of
 
01:58:03.410 --> 01:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
their um Equity that they had built up
 
01:58:05.149 --> 01:58:05.159 align:start position:0%
in their homes
 
01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
um it is uh it's a situation we would
 
01:58:09.410 --> 01:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
love to work with if there was a
 
01:58:11.810 --> 01:58:11.820 align:start position:0%
mechanism for us to work uh there's one
 
01:58:14.089 --> 01:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
very hard-working individual in that
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
community that will will probably make
 
01:58:18.410 --> 01:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
it resident owned I think before before
 
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
his final days and
 
01:58:22.370 --> 01:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
um is really the caretaker of that
 
01:58:24.770 --> 01:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
community so great Community they just
 
01:58:28.669 --> 01:58:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
I have too many questions try to be
 
01:58:34.199 --> 01:58:35.450 align:start position:0%
I have too many questions try to be
concise

01:58:35.450 --> 01:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
concise
 
01:58:39.649 --> 01:58:39.659 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned there being 300 vacant
 
01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:58:44.270 --> 01:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
Lots across the state and then spoke
 
01:58:46.850 --> 01:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
about upgrading the homes that some of
 
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
them are ones from before they were as
 
01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
good equality so are there 300 vacant
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
that have nothing on them and then
 
01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:54.890 align:start position:0%
that have nothing on them and then
additionally

01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
the improving the quality yes that's
 
01:58:57.840 --> 01:58:58.729 align:start position:0%
the improving the quality yes that's
true

01:58:58.729 --> 01:58:58.739 align:start position:0%
true
 
01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
um so I would say there's homes that
 
01:59:02.450 --> 01:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
there's lots that have been approved
 
01:59:03.890 --> 01:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
that a home has never been installed on
 
01:59:06.770 --> 01:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
and we have recently shifted our model a
 
01:59:08.450 --> 01:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
bit to bring on and provide additional
 
01:59:10.129 --> 01:59:10.139 align:start position:0%
technical assistance to those
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
communities that have multiple lots that
 
01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
are vacant we are now helping them
 
01:59:16.250 --> 01:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
because just like and it's really hard
 
01:59:17.930 --> 01:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
for an average homeowner to figure out
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
how to do this as a co-op board that's a
 
01:59:21.410 --> 01:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
whole nother level of commitment that a
 
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
volunteer has to do and so we're
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
providing technical assistance to those
 
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:26.639 align:start position:0%
communities to help them understand the
 
01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
process of laying the slab and how do we
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
hook up water and sewer and how do we
 
01:59:33.169 --> 01:59:33.179 align:start position:0%
get a new home located there and so that
 
01:59:34.490 --> 01:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
is something that we're helping to
 
01:59:36.169 --> 01:59:36.179 align:start position:0%
provide technical assistance on and we
 
01:59:38.089 --> 01:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
are looking to help fill those as
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
affordable home options that come up for
 
01:59:41.450 --> 01:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
sale on the General Market
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I think we probably will place 50
 
01:59:47.810 --> 01:59:47.820 align:start position:0%
new homes for this either rehab or or
 
01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
place 50 new homes this year but then we
 
01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
convert more communities in the and
 
01:59:54.169 --> 01:59:54.179 align:start position:0%
we're back up to 300 second Watts again
 
01:59:56.089 --> 01:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
yeah and we also will help with those
 
01:59:58.970 --> 01:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
ones that are vacant dilapidated to help
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
those communities unders go through the
 
02:00:02.450 --> 02:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
process of the tax title and the deed
 
02:00:04.490 --> 02:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
research and to take those homes to
 
02:00:06.770 --> 02:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
demolish them and to place new homes
 
02:00:08.810 --> 02:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
where they just have vacancy that's not
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
providing lot rent to the community
 
02:00:15.410 --> 02:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
and when you spoke about density what is
 
02:00:16.970 --> 02:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
the square footage lot that you would
 
02:00:19.129 --> 02:00:19.139 align:start position:0%
consider to be ideal
 
02:00:21.290 --> 02:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
I think it depends on the community and
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
all park or a range yeah so we have a
 
02:00:27.050 --> 02:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
really uh lovely community that we work
 
02:00:29.450 --> 02:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
with on Dover Point down near newicks
 
02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
that actually has 18 homes on one acre
 
02:00:34.990 --> 02:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
and it is it's a great little Community
 
02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
there are other communities that look
 
02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:40.679 align:start position:0%
like a subdivision of ranch houses
 
02:00:40.679 --> 02:00:41.709 align:start position:0%
like a subdivision of ranch houses
um

02:00:41.709 --> 02:00:41.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
my house about three blocks away from
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
here sits on
 
02:00:48.290 --> 02:00:48.300 align:start position:0%
um 5000 square feet just as dick was
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
talking about it's it's a it's you know
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
the the footprint of a manufactured home
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's the the same thing and and it's
 
02:00:58.729 --> 02:00:58.739 align:start position:0%
plenty of space so I think that you know
 
02:01:01.609 --> 02:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
the idea of putting eight on an acre is
 
02:01:04.430 --> 02:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
is there's a lot of lawn to mow with
 
02:01:06.530 --> 02:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
eight on an acre I also think it depends
 
02:01:08.450 --> 02:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
on Water and Sewer um and we could show
 
02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
you some examples and if you're looking
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
for hard data we could probably do some
 
02:01:13.970 --> 02:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
quick analysis on density differences in
 
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
different parks with some photos that
 
02:01:18.050 --> 02:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be too hard for us to provide
 
02:01:19.550 --> 02:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
to you so that you can see what some of
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
those look like and some are based on
 
02:01:23.149 --> 02:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
water and sewer and some have septic and
 
02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
well right so those do make a little bit
 
02:01:27.050 --> 02:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
of a difference and I do think it it's
 
02:01:29.450 --> 02:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
different in Portsmouth where um I think
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
we have 18 home where we have 18 on one
 
02:01:34.970 --> 02:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
acre sometimes it's 12 and um and
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes so there's it depends yeah can
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
I do one more Yep
 
02:01:44.689 --> 02:01:44.699 align:start position:0%
so is 60 days enough notice for Park
 
02:01:47.689 --> 02:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
residents to organize to make an offer
 
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
when a private Equity investor is coming
 
02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
in that sounds really short to me it
 
02:01:54.530 --> 02:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
feels really short when it's happening
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
um too we We Do It um we do it every
 
02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:58.669 align:start position:0%
um too we We Do It um we do it every
time

02:01:58.669 --> 02:01:58.679 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
um we and that's to sign a purchase and
 
02:02:03.709 --> 02:02:03.719 align:start position:0%
say oh a matching purchase a sale so if
 
02:02:05.890 --> 02:02:05.900 align:start position:0%
in the informational session
 
02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
residents aren't committing to buy the
 
02:02:09.470 --> 02:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
park they're committing to do the
 
02:02:11.209 --> 02:02:11.219 align:start position:0%
research to see if they want including
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
the purchase of sale which has all of
 
02:02:14.689 --> 02:02:14.699 align:start position:0%
the conditions you would imagine with
 
02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
financing and you know infrastructure
 
02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
studies and things like that so we're
 
02:02:22.970 --> 02:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
we're making it work with 60 days and
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
other laws we're seeing across the
 
02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
country that have proposed to our 60
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
days also
 
02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:30.109 align:start position:0%
days also
yep

02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:02:32.930 --> 02:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
so separately from what you said and
 
02:02:34.430 --> 02:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
this is just ever so helpful and
 
02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:35.750 align:start position:0%
this is just ever so helpful and
informative

02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
informative
 
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
are the homes being manufactured in New
 
02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire mostly or not
 
02:02:42.410 --> 02:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
no I think it's a variety of things
 
02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
there certainly are dealers there's
 
02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
manufacturer home sales in New Hampshire
 
02:02:47.089 --> 02:02:47.099 align:start position:0%
and so they're coming within New
 
02:02:48.050 --> 02:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there are New Hampshire
 
02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
jobs on manufactured housing but they
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
are being manufactured all over
 
02:02:55.850 --> 02:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
I think the closest uh facilities
 
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facilities to us now are
 
02:03:00.109 --> 02:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
in New York and Pennsylvania
 
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay representative
 
02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:02.990 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay representative
McConkey

02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
McConkey
 
02:03:05.089 --> 02:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
thank you uh excuse me thank you again
 
02:03:06.770 --> 02:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
02:03:08.930 --> 02:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
um ladies
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
um I talking about impediments I've been
 
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
in this business I've sold Parks
 
02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:17.930 align:start position:0%
in this business I've sold Parks
um

02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
the the people that um that they they
 
02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
have to be resin based to own a home in
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
there I can't remember
 
02:03:29.209 --> 02:03:29.219 align:start position:0%
so you can't sub lease a home that's in
 
02:03:29.219 --> 02:03:30.890 align:start position:0%
so you can't sub lease a home that's in
there

02:03:30.890 --> 02:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:03:30.900 --> 02:03:32.990 align:start position:0%
there
the

02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.129 align:start position:0%
the
um

02:03:34.129 --> 02:03:34.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:36.589 --> 02:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
does it have to be a manufactured home
 
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
could it be a modular home
 
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
we um
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
the communities and they if they don't
 
02:03:45.290 --> 02:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
have a loan with us they can make their
 
02:03:48.410 --> 02:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
own rules but we advise manufactured
 
02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
homes only because it keeps them within
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
the definition of a manufactured housing
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
Park which is how they get a lot of the
 
02:03:59.570 --> 02:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
advantages of density and private roads
 
02:04:02.530 --> 02:04:02.540 align:start position:0%
and and those kinds of advantages
 
02:04:06.649 --> 02:04:06.659 align:start position:0%
shortlist here at the end of 20 years in
 
02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
your financial obligation is done they
 
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
have the right to continue on
 
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
are can at the end of 20 years kid do
 
02:04:22.070 --> 02:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
don't have remain a co-op forever but
 
02:04:27.290 --> 02:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
the bylaws and the way they're
 
02:04:29.890 --> 02:04:29.900 align:start position:0%
Incorporated because they are a
 
02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit Cooperative means they
 
02:04:35.570 --> 02:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
can't benefit if they sold that
 
02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
Community okay they can pay off their
 
02:04:38.930 --> 02:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
debt they can pay back the membership
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
fee but the rest of it goes to a
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
charitable like kind use through the
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
charitable trust in talking about
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
impediments uh the park that one of the
 
02:04:50.450 --> 02:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
parks I'm familiar with if you were to
 
02:04:52.850 --> 02:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
apply the Town's new standard for
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
manufactured home park where there are
 
02:04:58.490 --> 02:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
four existing homes on this one property
 
02:05:01.370 --> 02:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
a new property would only have one home
 
02:05:05.810 --> 02:05:05.820 align:start position:0%
so average 3600 square feet works
 
02:05:08.450 --> 02:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
perfectly well in good sand and soil
 
02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:11.209 align:start position:0%
perfectly well in good sand and soil
they

02:05:11.209 --> 02:05:11.219 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:05:14.810 --> 02:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
in the other so zoning zonings is a huge
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
issue how many of your 300 vacant Lots
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
had a dilapidated home that was either
 
02:05:24.290 --> 02:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
not completely wasn't removed to the
 
02:05:26.330 --> 02:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
point that the town would now release
 
02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
the taxes on it is is that I I know of
 
02:05:32.810 --> 02:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
several that still have rotting frames
 
02:05:35.209 --> 02:05:35.219 align:start position:0%
sitting on the homes have been removed
 
02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
I got to believe that that's an issue
 
02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
for getting some of your Lots rented
 
02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
was a Supreme Court case about five
 
02:05:46.970 --> 02:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
years ago called Everett Ashton versus
 
02:05:49.490 --> 02:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
the city of Concord that says when the
 
02:05:52.490 --> 02:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
home is in that kind of non-inhabitable
 
02:05:55.629 --> 02:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
state that the town can no longer
 
02:05:58.910 --> 02:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
hold up the demo permit in exchange for
 
02:06:00.770 --> 02:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
the payment of taxes they have to Abate
 
02:06:04.129 --> 02:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
the taxes on it so that has made some
 
02:06:06.649 --> 02:06:06.659 align:start position:0%
progress in getting rid of some but
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
communities especially the boards of
 
02:06:12.109 --> 02:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
communities have got to do the work to
 
02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
do that if it's a home that actually
 
02:06:16.250 --> 02:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
still maybe has a title or an owner
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
there's a process they've they're
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
learning a lot about going through
 
02:06:22.129 --> 02:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
probate for residents that died and just
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
walked away from the home and the family
 
02:06:25.850 --> 02:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
is not interested so that's quite a
 
02:06:28.729 --> 02:06:28.739 align:start position:0%
process to do but we do we do work with
 
02:06:31.070 --> 02:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
communities on hiring an attorney and
 
02:06:32.930 --> 02:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
getting that done so we can put a new
 
02:06:42.410 --> 02:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:45.229 --> 02:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that you mentioned
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
Harbor Homes project and working with
 
02:06:49.010 --> 02:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
some veterans and putting a number of
 
02:06:52.570 --> 02:06:52.580 align:start position:0%
units was any of that done in existing
 
02:06:56.510 --> 02:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
Co-op Parks yes uh Rock Rimmon in
 
02:06:59.209 --> 02:06:59.219 align:start position:0%
Danville New Hampshire if at all
 
02:07:01.070 --> 02:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
possible if you could send that along we
 
02:07:03.470 --> 02:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
have a group of we have a group of
 
02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
residents in Ossipee that's been working
 
02:07:07.490 --> 02:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
on affordable housing we're working at
 
02:07:09.550 --> 02:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
Carroll County on a project
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
and they've come asking questions so
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for that thank you
 
02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:17.089 align:start position:0%
thank you for that thank you
representative

02:07:17.089 --> 02:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:07:18.649 --> 02:07:18.659 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking another
 
02:07:18.659 --> 02:07:19.609 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking another
question

02:07:19.609 --> 02:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
um you talked about
 
02:07:22.910 --> 02:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
um possibly being able to give us some
 
02:07:24.770 --> 02:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
density data on your
 
02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
your existing kind of membership or
 
02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
Parks or that you service or whatever
 
02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:31.070 align:start position:0%
Parks or that you service or whatever
um

02:07:31.070 --> 02:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:33.589 --> 02:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
if you could
 
02:07:36.410 --> 02:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
um separate out the parks that have
 
02:07:39.290 --> 02:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
their own water as far as like the
 
02:07:41.450 --> 02:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
density if they provide their own water
 
02:07:43.070 --> 02:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
or if it's
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
um city water I would like to see those
 
02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
density numbers split out specifically
 
02:07:51.169 --> 02:07:51.179 align:start position:0%
um you know what is the density of
 
02:07:53.149 --> 02:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
of you know Portsmouth versus the
 
02:07:55.609 --> 02:07:55.619 align:start position:0%
density of one that has their own septic
 
02:07:59.089 --> 02:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
and Sewer on on site because obviously
 
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to be less dense on those
 
02:08:03.410 --> 02:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you great
 
02:08:06.229 --> 02:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
um right any other questions thank you
 
02:08:07.790 --> 02:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
very much this is very helpful we
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I think I'm sold on these
 
02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
things I think I want one myself so I
 
02:08:14.629 --> 02:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate the help thank you

looking
 
03:18:45.889 --> 03:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
um particularly at
 
03:18:49.190 --> 03:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
um how housing intersects obviously with
 
03:18:51.950 --> 03:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
um your commission and if improvements
 
03:18:54.290 --> 03:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
any need to be made in that area thank
 
03:18:54.300 --> 03:18:56.630 align:start position:0%
any need to be made in that area thank
you

03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:00.110 --> 03:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
wait is it red is it red red is good
 
03:19:02.950 --> 03:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's counter-intuitive isn't it okay
 
03:19:06.050 --> 03:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
hi I am Sarah Burke Cohen I am the
 
03:19:07.190 --> 03:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
assistant director at the New Hampshire
 
03:19:09.769 --> 03:19:09.779 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights I am here to
 
03:19:11.090 --> 03:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
talk with you a little bit of today
 
03:19:11.100 --> 03:19:12.230 align:start position:0%
talk with you a little bit of today
about

03:19:12.230 --> 03:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:19:14.269 --> 03:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
um what we do and our housing laws where
 
03:19:17.150 --> 03:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
the intersection takes place so the New
 
03:19:18.889 --> 03:19:18.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire commission for human rights we
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
are the enforcement agency for RSA 354a
 
03:19:24.110 --> 03:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
and since I know you all have the
 
03:19:27.349 --> 03:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme memorized um the 354a
 
03:19:29.090 --> 03:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
are the laws against discrimination in
 
03:19:30.650 --> 03:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:19:30.660 --> 03:19:32.330 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
um so

03:19:32.330 --> 03:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:19:34.550 --> 03:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
um we do a couple of things right
 
03:19:36.230 --> 03:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
um like I say we are the enforcement
 
03:19:38.690 --> 03:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
agency we also are charged with
 
03:19:40.429 --> 03:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
educating the community
 
03:19:43.070 --> 03:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
doing Outreach talking with anybody who
 
03:19:44.690 --> 03:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
will listen about discrimination and
 
03:19:47.030 --> 03:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
ending it we cover a number of different
 
03:19:49.849 --> 03:19:49.859 align:start position:0%
areas so we cover employment housing
 
03:19:51.650 --> 03:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
public accommodation and public
 
03:19:54.230 --> 03:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
education and I will tell you that there
 
03:19:56.210 --> 03:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
is an intersection between housing and
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
public accommodation
 
03:19:59.389 --> 03:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
um I'll talk to you a little bit about
 
03:20:01.610 --> 03:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
that as I sort of go on just so that you
 
03:20:02.990 --> 03:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
understand where things sort of
 
03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:04.969 align:start position:0%
understand where things sort of
intersect

03:20:04.969 --> 03:20:04.979 align:start position:0%
intersect
 
03:20:07.969 --> 03:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
um we uh so the laws against
 
03:20:10.429 --> 03:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
discrimination protect uh folks what we
 
03:20:12.530 --> 03:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
call under protected classes in New
 
03:20:14.990 --> 03:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the protected classes are age
 
03:20:17.450 --> 03:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
and that's any age in housing so it
 
03:20:17.460 --> 03:20:18.290 align:start position:0%
and that's any age in housing so it
doesn't

03:20:18.290 --> 03:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
03:20:20.090 --> 03:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
um doesn't matter what age you are age
 
03:20:21.830 --> 03:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
is protected
 
03:20:24.769 --> 03:20:24.779 align:start position:0%
um sex which includes gender and
 
03:20:27.769 --> 03:20:27.779 align:start position:0%
pregnancy sexual orientation gender
 
03:20:30.290 --> 03:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
identity race color religion national
 
03:20:33.889 --> 03:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
origin marital status disability and
 
03:20:35.750 --> 03:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
then the housing Arena only familial
 
03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
status familial status is if you have
 
03:20:41.630 --> 03:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
children 18 years or younger living with
 
03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
you that definitely becomes an important
 
03:20:47.929 --> 03:20:47.939 align:start position:0%
thing in the housing area we do see a
 
03:20:50.469 --> 03:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
number of cases where discrimination
 
03:20:52.910 --> 03:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
takes place based on that familial
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
status I have sort of to back up for a
 
03:20:58.190 --> 03:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
second I have a little bit of a unique
 
03:20:59.570 --> 03:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
perspective when it comes to fair
 
03:20:59.580 --> 03:21:00.830 align:start position:0%
perspective when it comes to fair
housing

03:21:00.830 --> 03:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
housing
 
03:21:02.990 --> 03:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
I work at the commission now I used to
 
03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
work for a New Hampshire legal
 
03:21:06.230 --> 03:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
assistance in their fair housing
 
03:21:06.240 --> 03:21:06.769 align:start position:0%
assistance in their fair housing
um

03:21:06.769 --> 03:21:06.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:09.950 --> 03:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh programs so I sort of have seen it
 
03:21:14.150 --> 03:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
sort of from representing clients to now
 
03:21:18.170 --> 03:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:18.180 --> 03:21:19.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:21:19.309 --> 03:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:21.410 --> 03:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
I'm going to kind of skip our process
 
03:21:23.510 --> 03:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
because I want to get to know what your
 
03:21:25.730 --> 03:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
questions are so our process for
 
03:21:28.429 --> 03:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement just briefly is
 
03:21:31.370 --> 03:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
um we do everything at our agency okay
 
03:21:33.650 --> 03:21:33.660 align:start position:0%
we do intake so people call us with
 
03:21:35.389 --> 03:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
complaints we help them draft a charge
 
03:21:38.929 --> 03:21:38.939 align:start position:0%
we investigate those complaints and we
 
03:21:40.790 --> 03:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
can have a public hearing on those
 
03:21:42.830 --> 03:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
complaints a public adjudicative hearing
 
03:21:44.750 --> 03:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
to make a final decision we can award
 
03:21:47.990 --> 03:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
damages on that complaint and Levy fines
 
03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:49.190 align:start position:0%
damages on that complaint and Levy fines
um

03:21:49.190 --> 03:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:52.130 --> 03:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
so where I wanted to talk with you a
 
03:21:53.630 --> 03:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
little bit about so housing
 
03:21:53.640 --> 03:21:55.309 align:start position:0%
little bit about so housing
discrimination

03:21:55.309 --> 03:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
03:21:57.650 --> 03:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
um we obviously enforce the state
 
03:22:00.950 --> 03:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
statute there are a few exceptions to
 
03:22:02.570 --> 03:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
the state statute
 
03:22:04.730 --> 03:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
um where I venture to say you can
 
03:22:06.590 --> 03:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
actually discriminate
 
03:22:09.710 --> 03:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
um uh as a landlord so let's talk about
 
03:22:11.570 --> 03:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
those a little bit so
 
03:22:14.450 --> 03:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
um housing discrimination Empire it
 
03:22:18.050 --> 03:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
applies to all landlords except if you
 
03:22:20.330 --> 03:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
are owner occupied in New Hampshire you
 
03:22:22.730 --> 03:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
have to have three units or less you
 
03:22:24.050 --> 03:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
have to live there
 
03:22:27.050 --> 03:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
so you can't be oh I owner I'm owner
 
03:22:28.550 --> 03:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
occupied but I live in the house next
 
03:22:31.610 --> 03:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
door so you live in the property that
 
03:22:36.410 --> 03:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
you can really decide who is renting
 
03:22:40.010 --> 03:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
from you
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
the thought process behind that is that
 
03:22:44.030 --> 03:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's your home because you're living
 
03:22:46.250 --> 03:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
there and it's a small small enough
 
03:22:48.410 --> 03:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
space that you're not you're sort of in
 
03:22:50.510 --> 03:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
the market as a landlord but not really
 
03:22:53.210 --> 03:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
in a big Market as a landlord housing
 
03:22:54.710 --> 03:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
for the elderly
 
03:22:55.849 --> 03:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
um that's what it's called in the
 
03:22:57.469 --> 03:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
statute so
 
03:23:00.110 --> 03:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
um that is senior housing there are
 
03:23:02.809 --> 03:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
exceptions to our age discrimination
 
03:23:02.819 --> 03:23:04.070 align:start position:0%
exceptions to our age discrimination
statute

03:23:04.070 --> 03:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:23:05.809 --> 03:23:05.819 align:start position:0%
um they're very specific on how they
 
03:23:08.030 --> 03:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
work who can be include included who can
 
03:23:10.490 --> 03:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
be excluded and how that works 55 plus
 
03:23:12.830 --> 03:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
communities and then I think it's
 
03:23:15.769 --> 03:23:15.779 align:start position:0%
60 plus 65 plus communities have some
 
03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
different rules that are exempt from the
 
03:23:21.429 --> 03:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
straight up age
 
03:23:23.950 --> 03:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the statute
 
03:23:26.929 --> 03:23:26.939 align:start position:0%
there are single-family homes if I own a
 
03:23:29.870 --> 03:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
house and I sell it to to representative
 
03:23:32.389 --> 03:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
Alexander and I don't use anybody to
 
03:23:34.670 --> 03:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
help me sell it right I just do it
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
myself then I can choose who I sell that
 
03:23:39.769 --> 03:23:39.779 align:start position:0%
to because I'm not in the business of
 
03:23:43.190 --> 03:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
being a landlord okay and then one of
 
03:23:45.229 --> 03:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
the other exceptions is housing operated
 
03:23:49.130 --> 03:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
by sort of uh clubs or religious
 
03:23:51.469 --> 03:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
organizations those are really you have
 
03:23:54.229 --> 03:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
to be a member so the the real
 
03:23:54.239 --> 03:23:54.849 align:start position:0%
to be a member so the the real
um

03:23:54.849 --> 03:23:54.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:00.590 --> 03:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:02.349 --> 03:24:02.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:24:04.729 --> 03:24:04.739 align:start position:0%
religious facilities you know if you're
 
03:24:07.010 --> 03:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
a priest and you're live someplace or a
 
03:24:09.769 --> 03:24:09.779 align:start position:0%
monastery where you have to be a member
 
03:24:13.130 --> 03:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
in order to be in that housing or uh
 
03:24:15.950 --> 03:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
looked at for that housing
 
03:24:17.630 --> 03:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
so let's talk a little bit about what's
 
03:24:19.790 --> 03:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
prohibited right so what what do we have
 
03:24:22.849 --> 03:24:22.859 align:start position:0%
that's prohibited what is sort of what
 
03:24:25.130 --> 03:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
do we see that landlords can or are
 
03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
doing right so it is treating people
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
differently right based on their
 
03:24:33.469 --> 03:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
protected class hey we're only putting
 
03:24:37.550 --> 03:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
um we are only renting allowing
 
03:24:39.530 --> 03:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
um men to be in this building and women
 
03:24:41.929 --> 03:24:41.939 align:start position:0%
have to be in this building that would
 
03:24:43.729 --> 03:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
be treating people differently it can
 
03:24:45.410 --> 03:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
also be other specific terms and
 
03:24:45.420 --> 03:24:46.910 align:start position:0%
also be other specific terms and
conditions

03:24:46.910 --> 03:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
03:24:48.830 --> 03:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
um more specific it can be steering
 
03:24:50.510 --> 03:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
which is also differing treatment
 
03:24:53.690 --> 03:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
steering is when what we see and have
 
03:24:55.969 --> 03:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
seen in the past is
 
03:24:57.769 --> 03:24:57.779 align:start position:0%
um landlords steering families with
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
children to specific units hey this unit
 
03:25:04.190 --> 03:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
is maybe you have shiny building a and
 
03:25:06.590 --> 03:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
and not so shiny Building B and we're
 
03:25:07.910 --> 03:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
going to put all the families with
 
03:25:10.370 --> 03:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
children in this other building and if
 
03:25:12.110 --> 03:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
there's no units available then we're
 
03:25:14.929 --> 03:25:14.939 align:start position:0%
not renting shiny building a to any
 
03:25:17.870 --> 03:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
families with children kind of inhibits
 
03:25:19.790 --> 03:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
right the ability for people to find
 
03:25:21.769 --> 03:25:21.779 align:start position:0%
housing right if you're only renting to
 
03:25:24.710 --> 03:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
specific people in specific buildings
 
03:25:27.650 --> 03:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
there's also exclusionary zoning I
 
03:25:30.769 --> 03:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a big exclusionary Zone in
 
03:25:33.110 --> 03:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
case it case but I know they're out
 
03:25:34.910 --> 03:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
there we haven't seen them at the
 
03:25:36.710 --> 03:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
commission a lot of the exclusionary
 
03:25:38.269 --> 03:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
zoning cases
 
03:25:40.429 --> 03:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a current contract with
 
03:25:42.590 --> 03:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
HUD have HUD will see those more than
 
03:25:44.650 --> 03:25:44.660 align:start position:0%
than us right now
 
03:25:46.610 --> 03:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
also of course there's straight up
 
03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
refusal to rent I'm not renting to you
 
03:25:51.050 --> 03:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
because of your race color national
 
03:25:52.969 --> 03:25:52.979 align:start position:0%
origin or your religion or your
 
03:25:52.979 --> 03:25:54.130 align:start position:0%
origin or your religion or your
disability

03:25:54.130 --> 03:25:54.140 align:start position:0%
disability
 
03:25:57.050 --> 03:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
it can be failing to provide a
 
03:25:58.429 --> 03:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation or reasonable
 
03:26:00.469 --> 03:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
modification if I come and try to rent
 
03:26:02.389 --> 03:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
you and I have a wheelchair and I ask if
 
03:26:04.550 --> 03:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
you can put uh you know some sort of
 
03:26:07.010 --> 03:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
ramp on the building and you say no I'm
 
03:26:08.450 --> 03:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
not renting to you because you have a
 
03:26:10.370 --> 03:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
disability that becomes problematic and
 
03:26:13.510 --> 03:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
potentially discriminatory we often see
 
03:26:16.309 --> 03:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
the cases that come in for us are based
 
03:26:18.410 --> 03:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
on disability and people requesting
 
03:26:20.030 --> 03:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodations and reasonable
 
03:26:22.610 --> 03:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
modifications reasonable accommodations
 
03:26:25.610 --> 03:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
are changes to the rules right changes
 
03:26:27.590 --> 03:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
to the terms and conditions reasonable
 
03:26:29.990 --> 03:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
modifications are changes to the the
 
03:26:32.450 --> 03:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
facility the physical building itself I
 
03:26:34.610 --> 03:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
need a pull bar in my bathroom can I can
 
03:26:37.070 --> 03:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
I install it or can you install it
 
03:26:40.610 --> 03:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
depending on who is funding who who the
 
03:26:43.309 --> 03:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
um if the um landlord is getting federal
 
03:26:43.319 --> 03:26:45.769 align:start position:0%
um if the um landlord is getting federal
funds

03:26:45.769 --> 03:26:45.779 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:26:47.630 --> 03:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to talk with you a little
 
03:26:50.570 --> 03:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
bit about where the intersection
 
03:26:50.580 --> 03:26:51.710 align:start position:0%
bit about where the intersection
um between

03:26:51.710 --> 03:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
um between
 
03:26:54.050 --> 03:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
housing and public accommodation right
 
03:26:57.769 --> 03:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
so housing clearly are residential right
 
03:26:59.570 --> 03:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
residential units it's called in the
 
03:27:01.790 --> 03:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
statute it is defined as a dwelling
 
03:27:03.889 --> 03:27:03.899 align:start position:0%
right where somebody actually lives
 
03:27:06.290 --> 03:27:06.300 align:start position:0%
right where the intersection happens is
 
03:27:07.490 --> 03:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
public accommodation public
 
03:27:09.889 --> 03:27:09.899 align:start position:0%
accommodation falls into falls into
 
03:27:12.410 --> 03:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
place where you have homeless shelters
 
03:27:15.229 --> 03:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
hotels those are considered places of
 
03:27:17.269 --> 03:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
public accommodation which still fall
 
03:27:19.790 --> 03:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
under RSA 354a where people can't
 
03:27:22.190 --> 03:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
actually discriminate uh people trying
 
03:27:25.070 --> 03:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
to go to those facilities based on their
 
03:27:26.809 --> 03:27:26.819 align:start position:0%
race color national origin any of those
 
03:27:26.819 --> 03:27:28.010 align:start position:0%
race color national origin any of those
basis

03:27:28.010 --> 03:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
basis
 
03:27:28.020 --> 03:27:28.790 align:start position:0%
basis
um

03:27:28.790 --> 03:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:31.490 --> 03:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
so there is that intersection that
 
03:27:33.170 --> 03:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
anybody that really is a housing
 
03:27:36.290 --> 03:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
provider really falls under RSA 354a and
 
03:27:37.729 --> 03:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be discriminating based on
 
03:27:39.530 --> 03:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
those protected classes and a charge
 
03:27:41.570 --> 03:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
could potentially be in front of us if
 
03:27:43.130 --> 03:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
they're doing that
 
03:27:46.010 --> 03:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
that's sort of my general what we do so
 
03:27:48.050 --> 03:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
what are your questions what can I
 
03:27:48.060 --> 03:27:49.670 align:start position:0%
what are your questions what can I
answer

03:27:49.670 --> 03:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
answer
 
03:27:52.309 --> 03:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
to you for you so my my first question
 
03:27:52.319 --> 03:27:53.389 align:start position:0%
to you for you so my my first question
is

03:27:53.389 --> 03:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:27:53.399 --> 03:27:54.530 align:start position:0%
is
um

03:27:54.530 --> 03:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:54.540 --> 03:27:57.170 align:start position:0%
um
regarding

03:27:57.170 --> 03:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
03:27:59.690 --> 03:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
55 plus communities what
 
03:28:02.389 --> 03:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
if there's no discrimination on age
 
03:28:04.849 --> 03:28:04.859 align:start position:0%
and then there's communities that
 
03:28:07.030 --> 03:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
require 55 plus what that looks like
 
03:28:09.290 --> 03:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
legally I'm sure I know it's allowed but
 
03:28:11.269 --> 03:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand where that
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
comes from yeah and then
 
03:28:13.319 --> 03:28:14.510 align:start position:0%
comes from yeah and then
um

03:28:14.510 --> 03:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:17.330 --> 03:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
why haven't there been more
 
03:28:21.830 --> 03:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
um more pushback when a community says
 
03:28:23.990 --> 03:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
no to a development because it could
 
03:28:26.090 --> 03:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
have the potential of having children in
 
03:28:28.910 --> 03:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
it like as a as if that's used as a
 
03:28:32.330 --> 03:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
specific finding effect in a refusal why
 
03:28:33.590 --> 03:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:28:37.490 --> 03:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
is that allowed right okay okay so let's
 
03:28:39.349 --> 03:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
take that apart um I think that's going
 
03:28:41.030 --> 03:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
to be easier let's start with the 55
 
03:28:42.650 --> 03:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
plus communities
 
03:28:46.190 --> 03:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
I don't have it all right here but 55
 
03:28:47.929 --> 03:28:47.939 align:start position:0%
plus communities
 
03:28:49.790 --> 03:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
um essentially what happens is you have
 
03:28:52.309 --> 03:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
to be 55 or older right to apply for
 
03:28:53.349 --> 03:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
this community
 
03:28:57.170 --> 03:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
however I believe 80 percent of the
 
03:28:59.690 --> 03:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
community has to be 55 plus and that
 
03:29:02.870 --> 03:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
other 20 can be not 55 plus so let's
 
03:29:06.170 --> 03:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
just say my spouse and I want to enter
 
03:29:09.969 --> 03:29:09.979 align:start position:0%
into a 55 plus community and he's
 
03:29:13.790 --> 03:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
45. we still can apply for that we can't
 
03:29:16.370 --> 03:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
be denied just based on him being under
 
03:29:19.849 --> 03:29:19.859 align:start position:0%
the age of 55. okay same goes with if
 
03:29:22.790 --> 03:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
I'm living in a 55 plus community and
 
03:29:24.590 --> 03:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
maybe I have to take custody of a
 
03:29:24.600 --> 03:29:26.269 align:start position:0%
maybe I have to take custody of a
grandchild

03:29:26.269 --> 03:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
grandchild
 
03:29:28.550 --> 03:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
um that grandchild can still be allowed
 
03:29:31.729 --> 03:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
in the community because of
 
03:29:34.190 --> 03:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
um because of the 80 20 split right they
 
03:29:36.650 --> 03:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
still allow people under the age of 55
 
03:29:39.769 --> 03:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
to be there so that's where the
 
03:29:42.889 --> 03:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
community is you're exempt the community
 
03:29:44.510 --> 03:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
exempt is exempt from the age
 
03:29:44.520 --> 03:29:46.070 align:start position:0%
exempt is exempt from the age
discrimination

03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
03:29:50.330 --> 03:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
um portion of RSA 354a as long as they
 
03:29:52.910 --> 03:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
are following the specific rule so if
 
03:29:55.190 --> 03:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
I'm 55 I apply but you deny me because
 
03:29:58.070 --> 03:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
my husband is under the age of 55 that
 
03:29:59.929 --> 03:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
could potentially be you know we could
 
03:30:01.490 --> 03:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
be discriminatory because you're
 
03:30:03.590 --> 03:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
discriminating you're not following the
 
03:30:05.510 --> 03:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
rules when it comes to 55 plus Community
 
03:30:09.830 --> 03:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
now I believe it's 60 or 65 plus has
 
03:30:12.349 --> 03:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
different rules sort of the older people
 
03:30:14.210 --> 03:30:14.220 align:start position:0%
get have different rules right because
 
03:30:18.110 --> 03:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
you start getting into assisted living
 
03:30:20.510 --> 03:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
care communities which really are only
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
for people who are a certain age or
 
03:30:26.630 --> 03:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
older nursing homes Etc kind of fall
 
03:30:29.030 --> 03:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
into that so then it can be a hundred
 
03:30:32.030 --> 03:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
percent over the age of six State now
 
03:30:33.290 --> 03:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
can you repeat your other question
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
because it's already it's in there but I
 
03:30:37.130 --> 03:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
just want you to help me get it back to
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
the top yeah um we recently passed
 
03:30:43.190 --> 03:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
language that says that when a um
 
03:30:45.650 --> 03:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
a project is denied
 
03:30:47.809 --> 03:30:47.819 align:start position:0%
there has to be specific findings of
 
03:30:50.030 --> 03:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
fact and I guess
 
03:30:53.570 --> 03:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
is one of those findings of fact
 
03:30:55.790 --> 03:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
could could it be that
 
03:30:58.849 --> 03:30:58.859 align:start position:0%
the project has the potential of having
 
03:31:01.010 --> 03:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
many children
 
03:31:02.450 --> 03:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
and pressure on the school district
 
03:31:06.590 --> 03:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
would that be allowed as a finding a
 
03:31:08.330 --> 03:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
fact to deny a project
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
and your interpretation of that well I
 
03:31:13.490 --> 03:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
will tell you I mean so the commission
 
03:31:15.950 --> 03:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
03:31:18.410 --> 03:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
any case can be a charge right
 
03:31:21.229 --> 03:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
um so in that case if the project is
 
03:31:24.650 --> 03:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
found to be denied based on its impact
 
03:31:26.269 --> 03:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
on the school district could someone
 
03:31:28.849 --> 03:31:28.859 align:start position:0%
could an individual bring a charge could
 
03:31:31.309 --> 03:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
uh I would say a town person bring a
 
03:31:33.590 --> 03:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
charge I mean the answer to that is yes
 
03:31:36.050 --> 03:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
they could be bring a charge I think
 
03:31:36.060 --> 03:31:37.309 align:start position:0%
they could be bring a charge I think
that

03:31:37.309 --> 03:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:31:38.870 --> 03:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
03:31:42.050 --> 03:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
when it comes to cases in front of the
 
03:31:44.090 --> 03:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
commission right so what would happen is
 
03:31:46.729 --> 03:31:46.739 align:start position:0%
the towns person would bring a charge
 
03:31:49.070 --> 03:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
hey this is being denied based on we
 
03:31:52.790 --> 03:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
believe is exclusionary zoning right and
 
03:31:54.250 --> 03:31:54.260 align:start position:0%
um the affirmative defense would be like
 
03:31:56.870 --> 03:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
would be hey well this is going to
 
03:31:59.090 --> 03:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
impact the tax basis is going to impact
 
03:32:00.769 --> 03:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
and then the commission would make a
 
03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
decision from there based on case law
 
03:32:05.210 --> 03:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
based on you know statutory
 
03:32:07.250 --> 03:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
interpretation can I tell you right now
 
03:32:09.950 --> 03:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
what that decision would May would be no
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
because I'd need to really look at we we
 
03:32:14.750 --> 03:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
need to look at the actual specifics and
 
03:32:17.030 --> 03:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
the sort of that case by case basis and
 
03:32:19.849 --> 03:32:19.859 align:start position:0%
look at it in terms of what other case
 
03:32:23.630 --> 03:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
law is right out there right now and I'm
 
03:32:23.640 --> 03:32:24.849 align:start position:0%
law is right out there right now and I'm
not

03:32:24.849 --> 03:32:24.859 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:32:27.889 --> 03:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
It's A New Concept I was just curious
 
03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
yeah but I mean it would be it would be
 
03:32:31.790 --> 03:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
something that would be chargeable I
 
03:32:33.769 --> 03:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
mean that we would certainly investigate
 
03:32:36.950 --> 03:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
based on that because the question is is
 
03:32:38.870 --> 03:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
this you know is this is this
 
03:32:40.729 --> 03:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
exclusionary zoning if we're saying hey
 
03:32:42.650 --> 03:32:42.660 align:start position:0%
we're not we don't essentially we don't
 
03:32:44.630 --> 03:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
want children here because it's going to
 
03:32:47.929 --> 03:32:47.939 align:start position:0%
impact the taxes in the school district
 
03:32:50.809 --> 03:32:50.819 align:start position:0%
it certainly could be brought okay thank
 
03:32:53.389 --> 03:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
you um representative
 
03:32:54.830 --> 03:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:32:57.170 --> 03:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
um I have a real world thing happening
 
03:32:57.180 --> 03:32:58.370 align:start position:0%
um I have a real world thing happening
okay

03:32:58.370 --> 03:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:33:01.370 --> 03:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
um and it has been happening for uh well
 
03:33:03.229 --> 03:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
over a year I think but
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
um it's actually a company that's that's
 
03:33:06.769 --> 03:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
actually presented to this very
 
03:33:09.650 --> 03:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
committee uh bought a retirement
 
03:33:13.010 --> 03:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
community in my town and ever since then
 
03:33:16.070 --> 03:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
they've had a whole bunch of issues
 
03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
um multiple different issues but
 
03:33:20.570 --> 03:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
specifically uh issues around
 
03:33:24.229 --> 03:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
accessibility and one accessibility of
 
03:33:26.570 --> 03:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
the general uh property
 
03:33:28.370 --> 03:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
for everybody because there's a lot of
 
03:33:30.710 --> 03:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh mobily impaired people there
 
03:33:33.889 --> 03:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
obviously but also one particular person
 
03:33:36.590 --> 03:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
who is missing one of her legs and
 
03:33:38.990 --> 03:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
unable to use the shower or the bathtub
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
that was provided and we've asked for
 
03:33:43.130 --> 03:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
accommodations to be made and they've
 
03:33:47.210 --> 03:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
refused and I guess my question is uh
 
03:33:49.729 --> 03:33:49.739 align:start position:0%
what does one do and how would you all
 
03:33:52.190 --> 03:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
be able to help that situation
 
03:33:55.429 --> 03:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
so you know again I'm not providing
 
03:33:57.710 --> 03:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
legal advice that's not what we do and
 
03:33:59.510 --> 03:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
um but I will take this as a
 
03:34:01.429 --> 03:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
hypothetical that you're giving us and
 
03:34:03.650 --> 03:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
certainly um requesting a regional that
 
03:34:05.269 --> 03:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
would be a reasonable modification if
 
03:34:06.650 --> 03:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
you're asking for something to be
 
03:34:08.630 --> 03:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
changed in a facility it's a reasonable
 
03:34:12.650 --> 03:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
modification now not knowing uh I'll
 
03:34:13.910 --> 03:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
tell you a little bit about reasonable
 
03:34:13.920 --> 03:34:15.550 align:start position:0%
tell you a little bit about reasonable
modifications

03:34:15.550 --> 03:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
modifications
 
03:34:19.250 --> 03:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
generally speaking a landlord needs to
 
03:34:21.769 --> 03:34:21.779 align:start position:0%
allow those to those to occur reasonable
 
03:34:23.510 --> 03:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
modifications to occur unless there's
 
03:34:25.610 --> 03:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
some sort of undue hardship right for
 
03:34:27.950 --> 03:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
the landlord now what does that mean
 
03:34:31.130 --> 03:34:31.140 align:start position:0%
well that means if I need a bar a new
 
03:34:31.140 --> 03:34:32.030 align:start position:0%
well that means if I need a bar a new
tub

03:34:32.030 --> 03:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
tub
 
03:34:35.510 --> 03:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
Etc or a handicap or a wheelchair ramp
 
03:34:37.790 --> 03:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
that generally speaking the landlord has
 
03:34:40.370 --> 03:34:40.380 align:start position:0%
to allow that certainly with a a
 
03:34:43.370 --> 03:34:43.380 align:start position:0%
wheelchair ramp it has to do with um
 
03:34:45.469 --> 03:34:45.479 align:start position:0%
making sure there's enough space Etc et
 
03:34:47.809 --> 03:34:47.819 align:start position:0%
cetera now where it comes into play with
 
03:34:49.610 --> 03:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
the reasonable modifications is who pays
 
03:34:51.170 --> 03:34:51.180 align:start position:0%
for it right because a reasonable
 
03:34:53.690 --> 03:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
modification if you are a landlord that
 
03:34:56.570 --> 03:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
has is receiving no federal funds there
 
03:34:58.429 --> 03:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
are specific federal funds maybe Meryl
 
03:35:02.210 --> 03:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
can tell you so it's a Section 8 voucher
 
03:35:04.550 --> 03:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
so those aren't necessarily considered
 
03:35:06.110 --> 03:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
receiving federal funds that's the last
 
03:35:07.550 --> 03:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
time I
 
03:35:09.469 --> 03:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
um understood that that section 8
 
03:35:10.910 --> 03:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
vouchers aren't you're getting federal
 
03:35:12.110 --> 03:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
funds but you're not getting federal
 
03:35:13.910 --> 03:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
funds at the same time this particular
 
03:35:15.769 --> 03:35:15.779 align:start position:0%
structure was built with federal funds
 
03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
when it was originally built and a new
 
03:35:20.150 --> 03:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
person has has bought it but it's still
 
03:35:21.950 --> 03:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
under that I believe so if it's under
 
03:35:24.170 --> 03:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
that then reasonable modification wise
 
03:35:26.750 --> 03:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
the landlord would um have to pay for
 
03:35:29.090 --> 03:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
that modification right if it's not
 
03:35:31.370 --> 03:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
considered if the federal funds used to
 
03:35:34.190 --> 03:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
build the property or the federal funds
 
03:35:35.389 --> 03:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
that they're still receiving for the
 
03:35:37.550 --> 03:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
property aren't considered part of um
 
03:35:40.910 --> 03:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
there is a list of specifically what is
 
03:35:44.450 --> 03:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
um uh applicable then the person would
 
03:35:46.130 --> 03:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
have to pay for the modification right
 
03:35:47.570 --> 03:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
the individual would have to pay for
 
03:35:48.910 --> 03:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
that modification
 
03:35:52.010 --> 03:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it doesn't
 
03:35:53.750 --> 03:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
sound like there's a reason why they
 
03:35:55.729 --> 03:35:55.739 align:start position:0%
should be denying the modification right
 
03:35:57.910 --> 03:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
because there are I mean there are other
 
03:36:00.349 --> 03:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
agencies that will will help with sort
 
03:36:02.330 --> 03:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
of modifications right when it comes to
 
03:36:05.389 --> 03:36:05.399 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities so if a person
 
03:36:07.250 --> 03:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
were to get denied that modification
 
03:36:10.790 --> 03:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
right they have sort of a couple of ways
 
03:36:11.870 --> 03:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
to go
 
03:36:13.550 --> 03:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
um they can file a charge with us
 
03:36:13.560 --> 03:36:14.510 align:start position:0%
um they can file a charge with us
certainly

03:36:14.510 --> 03:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
03:36:16.729 --> 03:36:16.739 align:start position:0%
um number one number two if they would
 
03:36:18.410 --> 03:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
prefer they can file a charge with Hut
 
03:36:21.050 --> 03:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
so we don't have a contract with them
 
03:36:22.849 --> 03:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
we're working on getting a contract with
 
03:36:25.429 --> 03:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
a HUD so that we can we can sort of work
 
03:36:25.439 --> 03:36:26.590 align:start position:0%
a HUD so that we can we can sort of work
together

03:36:26.590 --> 03:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:36:29.150 --> 03:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
that person should file a claim if the
 
03:36:31.070 --> 03:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
landlord's not allowing that
 
03:36:33.110 --> 03:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
modification to occur I would say that
 
03:36:35.150 --> 03:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
that would be a chargeable uh claim
 
03:36:37.610 --> 03:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
something that could be docketing uh Mr
 
03:36:39.349 --> 03:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
chairman clarify
 
03:36:40.670 --> 03:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
um so I did bring it's my fault because
 
03:36:42.590 --> 03:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
I brought up her this one tenants
 
03:36:44.630 --> 03:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
example very specifically but the
 
03:36:46.490 --> 03:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
property in general
 
03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
um the pavement lots of lots of barriers
 
03:36:51.950 --> 03:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
to Wheelchairs and Walkers and such so
 
03:36:53.929 --> 03:36:53.939 align:start position:0%
that it's difficult for them to navigate
 
03:36:57.110 --> 03:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
the actual common property
 
03:36:59.269 --> 03:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
um does that fall under accessibility
 
03:37:02.690 --> 03:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
ability and so you know certainly again
 
03:37:04.429 --> 03:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
it could be a claim that you could have
 
03:37:06.410 --> 03:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
more than one tenant bring and if you
 
03:37:07.910 --> 03:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
know that could bring to either the
 
03:37:11.690 --> 03:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency or the HRC or to HUD
 
03:37:13.490 --> 03:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
it's also something that you could bring
 
03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
to the attention of the the governor's
 
03:37:19.550 --> 03:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
Council on disability because they do
 
03:37:21.650 --> 03:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
they do also some accessibility and they
 
03:37:24.229 --> 03:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
work with landlords but what you're
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
talking about potentially you know like
 
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
I said you could dock it on you know a
 
03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
number of levels if there's
 
03:37:31.250 --> 03:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
accessibility issues as a whole I would
 
03:37:32.990 --> 03:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
definitely go to the governor's Council
 
03:37:36.229 --> 03:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
on disa councils Council commission
 
03:37:38.570 --> 03:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability thank you
 
03:37:40.070 --> 03:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
um I would talk to them about that
 
03:37:41.870 --> 03:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
accessibility as a whole but if there's
 
03:37:44.929 --> 03:37:44.939 align:start position:0%
accessibility issues certainly they are
 
03:37:47.150 --> 03:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
also you know again you know charges
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
that potentially could be brought other
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
at HUD or the HRC thank you I have an
 
03:37:52.969 --> 03:37:52.979 align:start position:0%
unrelated question I'll wait for others
 
03:37:54.349 --> 03:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna call and representative
 
03:37:54.359 --> 03:37:56.389 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna call and representative
McConkey

03:37:56.389 --> 03:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
McConkey
 
03:37:59.630 --> 03:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um and um thank
 
03:38:02.570 --> 03:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
you for being here two questions uh 55
 
03:38:05.090 --> 03:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
and older community we have a town that
 
03:38:07.010 --> 03:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
just finally passed its first Community
 
03:38:09.410 --> 03:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
it looks lovely everything's fine but
 
03:38:11.389 --> 03:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
there's a restriction in there that
 
03:38:16.429 --> 03:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
unless you need a a caretaker that would
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
be a reason to have someone occupying a
 
03:38:21.710 --> 03:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
home with someone under 55 but you had
 
03:38:23.929 --> 03:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you could have up to 20
 
03:38:26.170 --> 03:38:26.180 align:start position:0%
is that state statute up to 20 percent
 
03:38:30.530 --> 03:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
so if you had a hundred units and it's a
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
community with a lot of women with
 
03:38:34.849 --> 03:38:34.859 align:start position:0%
younger husbands then up to 20 of those
 
03:38:37.490 --> 03:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
people could be living there yeah okay
 
03:38:39.290 --> 03:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
according in accordance with the statute
 
03:38:41.389 --> 03:38:41.399 align:start position:0%
it is actually specifically in the
 
03:38:44.269 --> 03:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
statute as well okay thank you my second
 
03:38:46.610 --> 03:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
was you had mentioned
 
03:38:50.090 --> 03:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
um three units owner occupied does the
 
03:38:52.969 --> 03:38:52.979 align:start position:0%
owner make the fourth unit or if there's
 
03:38:56.570 --> 03:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
two units plus the plus I believe it's
 
03:38:59.870 --> 03:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
three units total right is that what I I
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
believe it's three units total so the
 
03:39:04.010 --> 03:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
homeowner would be one of so there could
 
03:39:06.650 --> 03:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
be two under the federal statute it's
 
03:39:09.170 --> 03:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
four units total so
 
03:39:09.180 --> 03:39:10.190 align:start position:0%
four units total so
um

03:39:10.190 --> 03:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:12.469 --> 03:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh but under the state statutes a little
 
03:39:13.910 --> 03:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
more restrictive so it's three units
 
03:39:16.610 --> 03:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
total thank you thank you Mr chairman uh
 
03:39:19.309 --> 03:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
representative sorry thank you
 
03:39:19.319 --> 03:39:21.710 align:start position:0%
representative sorry thank you
um

03:39:21.710 --> 03:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:24.889 --> 03:39:24.899 align:start position:0%
as far as the exclusionary zoning you
 
03:39:27.229 --> 03:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
you seem to
 
03:39:29.570 --> 03:39:29.580 align:start position:0%
um kind of talk a little bit about not
 
03:39:34.010 --> 03:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
really bringing many cases or
 
03:39:37.130 --> 03:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
um or maybe HUD is bringing the cases
 
03:39:39.530 --> 03:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
and you guys are not
 
03:39:44.269 --> 03:39:44.279 align:start position:0%
um but it seems to me that
 
03:39:44.279 --> 03:39:45.469 align:start position:0%
um but it seems to me that
um

03:39:45.469 --> 03:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:49.010 --> 03:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm not unclear on on why
 
03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's not more exclusionary zoning
 
03:39:54.349 --> 03:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
cases and if
 
03:39:57.590 --> 03:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
um do you do you need someone to come to
 
03:39:59.929 --> 03:39:59.939 align:start position:0%
bring that to you or can you do some
 
03:40:02.990 --> 03:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
research lights let's say we we see in
 
03:40:06.469 --> 03:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
this committee a lot that people or or
 
03:40:09.590 --> 03:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
towns are making kind of like the
 
03:40:12.729 --> 03:40:12.739 align:start position:0%
existing structures
 
03:40:15.469 --> 03:40:15.479 align:start position:0%
non-conforming anymore because they've
 
03:40:18.110 --> 03:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
they've what was built let's say on a
 
03:40:19.729 --> 03:40:19.739 align:start position:0%
quarter acre lot now they're requiring
 
03:40:23.210 --> 03:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
five acre lots and so all of those
 
03:40:25.370 --> 03:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
people are now being
 
03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
negatively affected
 
03:40:30.110 --> 03:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
by having more strict it's harder for
 
03:40:32.690 --> 03:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
them to improve their property and also
 
03:40:34.389 --> 03:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
another person
 
03:40:36.530 --> 03:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
wanting the same thing as their neighbor
 
03:40:38.570 --> 03:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
is no longer allowed to have that and
 
03:40:41.630 --> 03:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
that seem like a ripe opportunity for
 
03:40:43.610 --> 03:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
saying like you're excluding you know
 
03:40:46.250 --> 03:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
people just like the person next door
 
03:40:49.490 --> 03:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
from living in your community by you
 
03:40:52.729 --> 03:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
know over zoning this and does that need
 
03:40:54.530 --> 03:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
to be brought by someone within the town
 
03:40:57.349 --> 03:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
or can the con your
 
03:41:00.349 --> 03:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
kind of Department look on that on its
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
own and say hey this is this is um you
 
03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
know problematic and we're going to
 
03:41:06.830 --> 03:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
start kind of looking at that and and
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know putting a ceiling on that or do
 
03:41:10.250 --> 03:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
you need something legislatively that
 
03:41:14.510 --> 03:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
says hey if you have put more than you
 
03:41:18.290 --> 03:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
know 90 if if more than five percent of
 
03:41:22.190 --> 03:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
your you know homes in this area
 
03:41:24.950 --> 03:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
um are now non-conforming based on your
 
03:41:27.769 --> 03:41:27.779 align:start position:0%
change in regulation that that is
 
03:41:29.570 --> 03:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
considered exclusionary zoning and then
 
03:41:32.150 --> 03:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
that would Empower you to go do more I
 
03:41:32.160 --> 03:41:32.929 align:start position:0%
that would Empower you to go do more I
guess

03:41:32.929 --> 03:41:32.939 align:start position:0%
guess
 
03:41:35.870 --> 03:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna sort of break that up just
 
03:41:37.849 --> 03:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
a wee bit thank you for your question um
 
03:41:40.429 --> 03:41:40.439 align:start position:0%
so the first the first answer to your
 
03:41:44.090 --> 03:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
question is so HUD and the HRC we do
 
03:41:44.100 --> 03:41:44.809 align:start position:0%
question is so HUD and the HRC we do
um

03:41:44.809 --> 03:41:44.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:46.969 --> 03:41:46.979 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of there's an overlap right
 
03:41:48.889 --> 03:41:48.899 align:start position:0%
HUD enforces the federal fair housing
 
03:41:51.290 --> 03:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
acts and we uh enforce the State Fair
 
03:41:53.389 --> 03:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
Housing Act the short answer to your
 
03:41:55.370 --> 03:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
question is we do keep an eye on what's
 
03:41:58.429 --> 03:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
going on in our community we do have um
 
03:42:00.650 --> 03:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
you know statutorily we can bring you
 
03:42:02.330 --> 03:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
know charges our commissioners can bring
 
03:42:02.340 --> 03:42:03.889 align:start position:0%
know charges our commissioners can bring
charges

03:42:03.889 --> 03:42:03.899 align:start position:0%
charges
 
03:42:03.899 --> 03:42:04.610 align:start position:0%
charges
um

03:42:04.610 --> 03:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:07.790 --> 03:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh so if there we saw something that was
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
exclusionary certainly we could
 
03:42:12.889 --> 03:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
certainly people can bring them to those
 
03:42:15.590 --> 03:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
types of cases to us and file docket
 
03:42:17.090 --> 03:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
them as well
 
03:42:18.889 --> 03:42:18.899 align:start position:0%
I think that you need to keep in mind
 
03:42:20.809 --> 03:42:20.819 align:start position:0%
when it comes to exclusionary zoning
 
03:42:23.150 --> 03:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
that is covered by our statute
 
03:42:26.570 --> 03:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
we're talking about zoning that excludes
 
03:42:29.330 --> 03:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
based on a protected class
 
03:42:33.410 --> 03:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
so if that that zoning right caused
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:38.040 --> 03:42:39.550 align:start position:0%
 
let's

03:42:39.550 --> 03:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
let's
 
03:42:41.870 --> 03:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
right low-income people aren't a
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
protected class though so that's kind of
 
03:42:45.650 --> 03:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
a pro that's you know that that's not
 
03:42:48.769 --> 03:42:48.779 align:start position:0%
protected but if let's say
 
03:42:51.410 --> 03:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
um a zoning ordinance went through that
 
03:42:51.420 --> 03:42:52.370 align:start position:0%
um a zoning ordinance went through that
said

03:42:52.370 --> 03:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:42:53.690 --> 03:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
03:42:56.750 --> 03:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
somebody but you know no one of this
 
03:42:58.849 --> 03:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
insert race color national origin here
 
03:43:01.510 --> 03:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
can't buy a house in this area right
 
03:43:04.309 --> 03:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
that would exclude that protected class
 
03:43:06.710 --> 03:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to some of these City
 
03:43:09.349 --> 03:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
some cities and towns doing zoning based
 
03:43:11.929 --> 03:43:11.939 align:start position:0%
on okay well we're gonna make it so if
 
03:43:14.150 --> 03:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
you want to buy if you want to build on
 
03:43:16.250 --> 03:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
a lot here now it has to be five acres
 
03:43:18.290 --> 03:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
or if you want to build on a lot it has
 
03:43:21.769 --> 03:43:21.779 align:start position:0%
to be one and a half acres or you can't
 
03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
if it's not one and a half acres then
 
03:43:25.429 --> 03:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
you can't expand your
 
03:43:27.889 --> 03:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
um the buildings on your property right
 
03:43:31.610 --> 03:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
um that type of zoning those changes to
 
03:43:33.830 --> 03:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
zoning you know some would say is
 
03:43:37.010 --> 03:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
exclusionary it's not protected it's not
 
03:43:38.269 --> 03:43:38.279 align:start position:0%
um it has to be related to some
 
03:43:40.190 --> 03:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
protected class so it isn't something
 
03:43:42.830 --> 03:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
that we would be able to enforce if
 
03:43:45.889 --> 03:43:45.899 align:start position:0%
there is something that shows that you
 
03:43:48.830 --> 03:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
know there is a what we call a disparate
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
impact it means an impact on a bit a
 
03:43:53.150 --> 03:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
larger scale on a specific protected
 
03:43:55.309 --> 03:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
class then that would be something we
 
03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
could look at like for for example if
 
03:43:59.570 --> 03:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
the zoning takes place and you're seeing
 
03:43:59.580 --> 03:44:00.710 align:start position:0%
the zoning takes place and you're seeing
that

03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:03.469 --> 03:44:03.479 align:start position:0%
um that there is a bigger impact on
 
03:44:05.510 --> 03:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
let's just say
 
03:44:08.330 --> 03:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
um uh you know a specific community
 
03:44:10.969 --> 03:44:10.979 align:start position:0%
based on their national origin
 
03:44:12.530 --> 03:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
um then that would be something we could
 
03:44:15.530 --> 03:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
look at but if it's just you know there
 
03:44:17.990 --> 03:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
it has an impact on lower income people
 
03:44:20.150 --> 03:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
those folks aren't covered by our
 
03:44:23.330 --> 03:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
statute according to what protected
 
03:44:26.570 --> 03:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:29.330 --> 03:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
03:44:32.150 --> 03:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
03:44:34.910 --> 03:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
um so just following up on the
 
03:44:37.429 --> 03:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
discussion with representative Alexander
 
03:44:40.969 --> 03:44:40.979 align:start position:0%
about possibly denying a project because
 
03:44:43.490 --> 03:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
of the impact on a school district
 
03:44:46.010 --> 03:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
so I think what you were indicating was
 
03:44:49.309 --> 03:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
someone would have to bring a case that
 
03:44:51.530 --> 03:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
suggested that yeah the commission
 
03:44:51.540 --> 03:44:53.030 align:start position:0%
suggested that yeah the commission
doesn't

03:44:53.030 --> 03:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
03:44:53.040 --> 03:44:54.429 align:start position:0%
doesn't
um

03:44:54.429 --> 03:44:54.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
preemptively look at or set a policy on
 
03:45:00.530 --> 03:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
something like that generally no we do
 
03:45:02.630 --> 03:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
have the statutory authority to bring
 
03:45:05.510 --> 03:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
our own charges so if we saw let's just
 
03:45:08.929 --> 03:45:08.939 align:start position:0%
say the commissioner saw this popping up
 
03:45:10.790 --> 03:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
in a number of communities right housing
 
03:45:14.469 --> 03:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
developments are being reported To Us by
 
03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
Representatives hey you might want to
 
03:45:18.530 --> 03:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
look at you know this housing you know
 
03:45:20.570 --> 03:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
I'm going to name towns I don't know if
 
03:45:22.010 --> 03:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
they have these communities I'm just
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
naming random towns so you know uh
 
03:45:26.690 --> 03:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
milford's denying a housing property
 
03:45:28.550 --> 03:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
based on you know this alleged School
 
03:45:31.130 --> 03:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
District issue uh Hillsboro is all of
 
03:45:33.229 --> 03:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
these towns are if that was brought to
 
03:45:34.969 --> 03:45:34.979 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's attention it might be
 
03:45:36.769 --> 03:45:36.779 align:start position:0%
something that a commit we would BR the
 
03:45:38.389 --> 03:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
Commissioners would bring a charge based
 
03:45:38.399 --> 03:45:39.349 align:start position:0%
Commissioners would bring a charge based
on

03:45:39.349 --> 03:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:45:40.849 --> 03:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
um and sort of
 
03:45:43.729 --> 03:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
make it figure out what towns are this
 
03:45:45.830 --> 03:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
is actually happening in and maybe bring
 
03:45:48.830 --> 03:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
them all sort of all in so to speak
 
03:45:51.830 --> 03:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
um but we don't we don't issue we're not
 
03:45:53.210 --> 03:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
like the Attorney General's office where
 
03:45:55.790 --> 03:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
we would issue an opinion if that I
 
03:45:57.469 --> 03:45:57.479 align:start position:0%
guess that's sort of what you're asking
 
03:45:59.630 --> 03:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
right yes okay yeah we don't we wouldn't
 
03:46:02.210 --> 03:46:02.220 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't issue an opinion in that
 
03:46:04.370 --> 03:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
manner we would we would take we would
 
03:46:05.929 --> 03:46:05.939 align:start position:0%
have a commissioner bring a charge so
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
that we could investigate it and
 
03:46:09.889 --> 03:46:09.899 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
03:46:12.110 --> 03:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
so just to paraphrase I think it's
 
03:46:12.120 --> 03:46:14.090 align:start position:0%
so just to paraphrase I think it's
paraphrasing

03:46:14.090 --> 03:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing
 
03:46:15.410 --> 03:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
there would have to be something
 
03:46:17.090 --> 03:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
happening that is potentially
 
03:46:19.490 --> 03:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
discrimination in order for you to rule
 
03:46:25.250 --> 03:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:28.849 --> 03:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
a development hasn't been proposed but a
 
03:46:30.290 --> 03:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
community might have discussed that we
 
03:46:32.030 --> 03:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
don't want this kind of development that
 
03:46:33.710 --> 03:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
would have this impact yeah I mean if
 
03:46:36.110 --> 03:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
that's out there if you have a board of
 
03:46:41.150 --> 03:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
Select man or uh City Council
 
03:46:44.510 --> 03:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know Alderman all the names that go
 
03:46:47.150 --> 03:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
with the local government folks
 
03:46:49.429 --> 03:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
certainly if they're talking about that
 
03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
on the record and it's out there then
 
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
that would be something that you know
 
03:46:55.849 --> 03:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
the commission would be interested in at
 
03:46:57.710 --> 03:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
least taking you know potentially taking
 
03:47:00.170 --> 03:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
a look at and just I mean we do work
 
03:47:01.790 --> 03:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office we
 
03:47:03.290 --> 03:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
work with the Civil Rights unit really
 
03:47:05.929 --> 03:47:05.939 align:start position:0%
fairly you know closely
 
03:47:08.269 --> 03:47:08.279 align:start position:0%
um that so it would be something we
 
03:47:10.450 --> 03:47:10.460 align:start position:0%
would probably be interested in because
 
03:47:13.370 --> 03:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
a lot of times with things that happen
 
03:47:15.170 --> 03:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire communities it's like a
 
03:47:17.330 --> 03:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
domino effect right once one Community
 
03:47:20.570 --> 03:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
does it it sort of you know kind of
 
03:47:22.849 --> 03:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
Falls other communities are also looking
 
03:47:24.229 --> 03:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
at it so
 
03:47:26.990 --> 03:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
um we could there's we are we've broke
 
03:47:29.389 --> 03:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
double digits so we're actually at 10
 
03:47:31.790 --> 03:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
staff members now so
 
03:47:33.650 --> 03:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
anytime things like that are happening
 
03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
in the community if you see that you
 
03:47:37.849 --> 03:47:37.859 align:start position:0%
know something going on that you
 
03:47:39.530 --> 03:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
question certainly bring it to our
 
03:47:41.990 --> 03:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
attention sometimes we see you know we
 
03:47:44.389 --> 03:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
do the best to you know scour you know
 
03:47:46.429 --> 03:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
the union leader conquered monitor WMUR
 
03:47:48.290 --> 03:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
but we don't always see what's going on
 
03:47:50.570 --> 03:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller communities that may
 
03:47:53.110 --> 03:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
or may not be doing things that are
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
questionable and as it relates to RSA
 
03:47:59.450 --> 03:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
354a so if you see that or if it's
 
03:48:00.830 --> 03:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
talked about on the public record it
 
03:48:01.790 --> 03:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
would be something that the
 
03:48:03.229 --> 03:48:03.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioners would be interested in
 
03:48:05.809 --> 03:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
potentially pursuing representative
 
03:48:07.729 --> 03:48:07.739 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you
 
03:48:11.269 --> 03:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
um and uh thank you Sarah
 
03:48:13.790 --> 03:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
you've pointed out correctly that if a
 
03:48:16.969 --> 03:48:16.979 align:start position:0%
if a policy or local ordinance
 
03:48:19.070 --> 03:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
um has a discriminatory effect it may
 
03:48:22.210 --> 03:48:22.220 align:start position:0%
violate uh both the New Hampshire
 
03:48:24.290 --> 03:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination statute and the
 
03:48:26.570 --> 03:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
federal fair housing act
 
03:48:29.510 --> 03:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
um and you've pointed out also that this
 
03:48:32.030 --> 03:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
um may be true uh with certain types of
 
03:48:36.889 --> 03:48:36.899 align:start position:0%
zoning and I understand that um uh cases
 
03:48:38.929 --> 03:48:38.939 align:start position:0%
dealing with such an issue
 
03:48:40.969 --> 03:48:40.979 align:start position:0%
um are perhaps more likely to be brought
 
03:48:43.070 --> 03:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
to HUD uh than to the New Hampshire
 
03:48:45.410 --> 03:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission for various
 
03:48:45.420 --> 03:48:46.550 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission for various
reasons

03:48:46.550 --> 03:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
03:48:48.530 --> 03:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
um but there's another area where that
 
03:48:50.809 --> 03:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
may also be true
 
03:48:52.610 --> 03:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
um and that is with regard to source of
 
03:48:54.710 --> 03:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
income now neither the New Hampshire
 
03:48:56.990 --> 03:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
statute nor the federal fair housing
 
03:48:57.000 --> 03:48:58.670 align:start position:0%
statute nor the federal fair housing
statute

03:48:58.670 --> 03:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:48:58.680 --> 03:49:00.070 align:start position:0%
statute
um

03:49:00.070 --> 03:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
provide that source of income by itself
 
03:49:08.389 --> 03:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
constitutes illegal discrimination but
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
there are court cases including one in
 
03:49:10.680 --> 03:49:12.650 align:start position:0%
there are court cases including one in
Massachusetts

03:49:12.650 --> 03:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
03:49:16.010 --> 03:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
um that have found that source of income
 
03:49:16.020 --> 03:49:17.990 align:start position:0%
um that have found that source of income
discrimination

03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
03:49:20.809 --> 03:49:20.819 align:start position:0%
um May uh have a discriminatory effect
 
03:49:23.389 --> 03:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
and thus violate the federal fair
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
housing act on the basis of race
 
03:49:25.560 --> 03:49:27.370 align:start position:0%
housing act on the basis of race
discrimination

03:49:27.370 --> 03:49:27.380 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
03:49:30.769 --> 03:49:30.779 align:start position:0%
now has such a complaint ever been
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
brought to the New Hampshire commission
 
03:49:37.250 --> 03:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
and if it has how did you deal with it
 
03:49:39.590 --> 03:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
not that I'm aware of I've only been in
 
03:49:41.690 --> 03:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
the commission for seven years so if one
 
03:49:45.530 --> 03:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
has brought before that uh it it was
 
03:49:48.170 --> 03:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
it's outside of my historical knowledge
 
03:49:50.210 --> 03:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
um you know source of income has come up
 
03:49:52.849 --> 03:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
I know in front of the legislature a
 
03:49:55.729 --> 03:49:55.739 align:start position:0%
couple of years in a row back when I was
 
03:49:57.050 --> 03:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
working for New Hampshire legal
 
03:49:59.450 --> 03:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
assistance I know it had come up and you
 
03:50:02.929 --> 03:50:02.939 align:start position:0%
know it is something that we look at we
 
03:50:04.490 --> 03:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
don't look at we look at from the
 
03:50:06.590 --> 03:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
perspective of if this were added how
 
03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
would it work
 
03:50:11.269 --> 03:50:11.279 align:start position:0%
it is source of income is protected
 
03:50:13.389 --> 03:50:13.399 align:start position:0%
under Massachusetts state law
 
03:50:15.950 --> 03:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
I know that when I was with New
 
03:50:17.210 --> 03:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance we looked at
 
03:50:19.969 --> 03:50:19.979 align:start position:0%
it from the perspective of landlords
 
03:50:23.269 --> 03:50:23.279 align:start position:0%
denying folks who were on Section 8
 
03:50:26.870 --> 03:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
vouchers as sort of an if you reported
 
03:50:28.670 --> 03:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
you had a Section 8 voucher they said no
 
03:50:31.729 --> 03:50:31.739 align:start position:0%
right away without even looking at
 
03:50:34.870 --> 03:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
anything else so it's out there
 
03:50:36.710 --> 03:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
statutorily it would have to change we
 
03:50:39.050 --> 03:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
haven't had any case law before the
 
03:50:41.570 --> 03:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
commission that would indicate that it
 
03:50:43.190 --> 03:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
would be something I haven't seen any
 
03:50:45.290 --> 03:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
case law as it relates to that disparate
 
03:50:48.110 --> 03:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
impact on when it comes to race color
 
03:50:51.110 --> 03:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
national origin I'm sure it's out there
 
03:50:53.630 --> 03:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
but if I can find that case I will send
 
03:50:55.309 --> 03:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
it to you but it was quite quite a while
 
03:50:58.790 --> 03:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
ago theoretically also uh there could be
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
sex discrimination your statuses as well
 
03:51:05.389 --> 03:51:05.399 align:start position:0%
um disability so that there are there
 
03:51:07.670 --> 03:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
are a number of issues
 
03:51:11.389 --> 03:51:11.399 align:start position:0%
um uh and um a source of income Bill
 
03:51:13.309 --> 03:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
actually came before the legislature
 
03:51:15.170 --> 03:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
this year but unfortunately it didn't
 
03:51:15.180 --> 03:51:16.309 align:start position:0%
this year but unfortunately it didn't
pass

03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
pass
 
03:51:17.750 --> 03:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
um so thank you you're welcome
 
03:51:20.929 --> 03:51:20.939 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you and I'm
 
03:51:23.929 --> 03:51:23.939 align:start position:0%
gratified that uh representative yokella
 
03:51:25.610 --> 03:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
and now representative Gibbs have both
 
03:51:27.530 --> 03:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
touched on my original unrelated
 
03:51:29.809 --> 03:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
question that I've waited a while which
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
is we've heard in this committee that
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
even the fact that we have zoning
 
03:51:36.950 --> 03:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
ordinances at all stems back to the idea
 
03:51:39.170 --> 03:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
that it went to a Supreme Court case as
 
03:51:41.750 --> 03:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
I understand it that it was allowable on
 
03:51:44.269 --> 03:51:44.279 align:start position:0%
the basis of the health safety and
 
03:51:46.969 --> 03:51:46.979 align:start position:0%
Welfare of the people but that it's gone
 
03:51:48.830 --> 03:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
very far afield of what that original
 
03:51:52.190 --> 03:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
intent was and we can certainly point to
 
03:51:55.670 --> 03:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
the historic trend for zoning ordinances
 
03:52:01.790 --> 03:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
to be intended for racially and even a
 
03:52:03.290 --> 03:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
nation of origin discriminatory
 
03:52:03.300 --> 03:52:04.429 align:start position:0%
nation of origin discriminatory
practices

03:52:04.429 --> 03:52:04.439 align:start position:0%
practices
 
03:52:05.990 --> 03:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
probably we can prove that in New
 
03:52:07.429 --> 03:52:07.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but certainly across the
 
03:52:09.650 --> 03:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
country that has been historically the
 
03:52:13.010 --> 03:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
case could we not bring forward a case
 
03:52:16.849 --> 03:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
provided that we got the the people with
 
03:52:18.590 --> 03:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
standing to bring forward this education
 
03:52:21.050 --> 03:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
I'm absolutely positive we could
 
03:52:24.530 --> 03:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
um to say that even though technically
 
03:52:26.809 --> 03:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
it would be on you know the basis of
 
03:52:30.410 --> 03:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
income level that not just
 
03:52:32.750 --> 03:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's disproportionately affecting
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
certain races in nationalities of origin
 
03:52:37.429 --> 03:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
but historically has proven to be done
 
03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
for that very reason and I will just uh
 
03:52:42.590 --> 03:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
speak to the fact that when I brought
 
03:52:44.210 --> 03:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
forward a bill that would have reduced
 
03:52:46.490 --> 03:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh property tax burden on low-income
 
03:52:48.110 --> 03:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
people I was told by another
 
03:52:50.690 --> 03:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
representative of my own party oh no no
 
03:52:52.610 --> 03:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
we can't do that we'll bring up all the
 
03:52:54.550 --> 03:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
wrong kinds of people from Massachusetts
 
03:52:58.429 --> 03:52:58.439 align:start position:0%
right so um we know and there's plenty
 
03:53:00.530 --> 03:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
of I'm sorry is there yes
 
03:53:02.809 --> 03:53:02.819 align:start position:0%
can we not bring forward I feel like I'm
 
03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
the only one you're doing that and
 
03:53:06.110 --> 03:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other long context I
 
03:53:10.490 --> 03:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
will make sure to spread so
 
03:53:12.590 --> 03:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
um can we not bring forward such a case
 
03:53:15.469 --> 03:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
with that argument and saying this does
 
03:53:15.479 --> 03:53:16.790 align:start position:0%
with that argument and saying this does
not

03:53:16.790 --> 03:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:53:18.769 --> 03:53:18.779 align:start position:0%
um match the original
 
03:53:20.389 --> 03:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
um authorization for zoning ordinances
 
03:53:21.710 --> 03:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
being for the health safety and Welfare
 
03:53:24.229 --> 03:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
of people so the short answer is
 
03:53:26.630 --> 03:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
um I mean I would say yes
 
03:53:28.670 --> 03:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
um I sort of touched on it
 
03:53:28.680 --> 03:53:29.330 align:start position:0%
um I sort of touched on it
um

03:53:29.330 --> 03:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:32.450 --> 03:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know how is it Yoko yokella okay
 
03:53:34.910 --> 03:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
I was going to put a long e I'm sorry
 
03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
um representative I I I touched on it
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
with his question there are disparate
 
03:53:41.570 --> 03:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
impact cases desperate impact is sort of
 
03:53:41.580 --> 03:53:42.590 align:start position:0%
impact cases desperate impact is sort of
that

03:53:42.590 --> 03:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:44.690 --> 03:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
um I hate to put it in the same bucket
 
03:53:47.150 --> 03:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
but more of a class action right hey
 
03:53:50.990 --> 03:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
this is really impacting a big group not
 
03:53:52.969 --> 03:53:52.979 align:start position:0%
just a differing treatment case
 
03:53:56.570 --> 03:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
differing treatment is where I'm
 
03:53:58.130 --> 03:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
impacted right I'm being treated
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
differently based on my protected class
 
03:54:02.210 --> 03:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
disparate impact is yes it can be
 
03:54:03.950 --> 03:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
related to something out it could be
 
03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
like I think Meryl brought up it could
 
03:54:07.550 --> 03:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
be a case where
 
03:54:10.849 --> 03:54:10.859 align:start position:0%
um yes the The Upfront issue is income
 
03:54:14.090 --> 03:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
right but the backdrop of that and the
 
03:54:16.790 --> 03:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
statistical information right shows that
 
03:54:19.250 --> 03:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
this really is based on race color
 
03:54:20.929 --> 03:54:20.939 align:start position:0%
national origin hey folks are getting
 
03:54:22.910 --> 03:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
denied housing based on this or things
 
03:54:25.729 --> 03:54:25.739 align:start position:0%
are or zoning is not changing or is
 
03:54:28.130 --> 03:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
being changed to keep folks who are low
 
03:54:30.590 --> 03:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
income out which has a disparate impact
 
03:54:34.309 --> 03:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
means it impacts a protected protected
 
03:54:37.250 --> 03:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
basis on a whole right it shows that
 
03:54:39.290 --> 03:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
that's happening statistically so the
 
03:54:40.849 --> 03:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
short answer to your question is yes it
 
03:54:43.130 --> 03:54:43.140 align:start position:0%
could be a a charge could be wrought
 
03:54:46.610 --> 03:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
like I said charges can be brought right
 
03:54:48.290 --> 03:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
um anybody can you know anybody can
 
03:54:50.389 --> 03:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
bring a charge right
 
03:54:53.330 --> 03:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
um you know but then the commission's
 
03:54:56.450 --> 03:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
job is to ensure that it is being
 
03:54:59.630 --> 03:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
um it is enforcing RSA 354a in
 
03:55:02.150 --> 03:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
accordance with the you know the statute
 
03:55:04.610 --> 03:55:04.620 align:start position:0%
the case law and and I understood your
 
03:55:06.110 --> 03:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
answers about disparate impact before
 
03:55:08.689 --> 03:55:08.699 align:start position:0%
but my point was furthering it to say
 
03:55:11.389 --> 03:55:11.399 align:start position:0%
and the intent the original intent of
 
03:55:13.729 --> 03:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
many of these ordinances can be shown
 
03:55:16.490 --> 03:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
historically to be for that intent to be
 
03:55:19.070 --> 03:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
exclusionary not accidentally yeah right
 
03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
and certainly that's something I mean
 
03:55:23.210 --> 03:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
you know certainly that's something that
 
03:55:25.550 --> 03:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
we would we potentially as we
 
03:55:27.410 --> 03:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
investigate right could look at as well
 
03:55:30.229 --> 03:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
what you know where where is this intent
 
03:55:32.269 --> 03:55:32.279 align:start position:0%
where does this lie that's something
 
03:55:33.950 --> 03:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
that would be part of the investigation
 
03:55:35.389 --> 03:55:35.399 align:start position:0%
and that would certainly be something
 
03:55:36.710 --> 03:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
03:55:38.689 --> 03:55:38.699 align:start position:0%
um so the investigation is a bit like a
 
03:55:40.070 --> 03:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
tennis match right
 
03:55:41.630 --> 03:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
um we have a complainant right who
 
03:55:44.030 --> 03:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
lodges their charge and then hits you
 
03:55:45.530 --> 03:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
know serves the ball to the respondent
 
03:55:47.389 --> 03:55:47.399 align:start position:0%
who answers right with something maybe a
 
03:55:49.670 --> 03:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
health safety or you know whatever they
 
03:55:51.590 --> 03:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
answer is their affirmative defense and
 
03:55:54.050 --> 03:55:54.060 align:start position:0%
then it gets it gets hit back to the
 
03:55:55.610 --> 03:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
complainant so that could be something
 
03:55:57.769 --> 03:55:57.779 align:start position:0%
the complainant brings up you know after
 
03:55:59.689 --> 03:55:59.699 align:start position:0%
an affirmative defense hey well let's
 
03:56:01.189 --> 03:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
let's look at you know my statistical
 
03:56:02.750 --> 03:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
information is backed up by the fact
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
that the original intent by this that's
 
03:56:08.269 --> 03:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
a possibility I mean I'm just saying
 
03:56:10.370 --> 03:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
that that that is a case that could
 
03:56:12.290 --> 03:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
happen hypothetically
 
03:56:14.510 --> 03:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
I have not seen a case like that come
 
03:56:16.189 --> 03:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
through the commission okay you may
 
03:56:19.250 --> 03:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
representative representative McConkey
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and to follow up
 
03:56:24.110 --> 03:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
on Chairman's question
 
03:56:24.120 --> 03:56:25.330 align:start position:0%
on Chairman's question
um

03:56:25.330 --> 03:56:25.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:28.370 --> 03:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
subdivisions higher density most times
 
03:56:30.830 --> 03:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
many times will come down to children we
 
03:56:33.050 --> 03:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
don't want children in school our
 
03:56:36.170 --> 03:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
school-aged children a protective class
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
or do they have to be Navajo school-aged
 
03:56:42.469 --> 03:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
children well that what's interesting is
 
03:56:44.330 --> 03:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
that is the protected class would sort
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
of be familial status right families
 
03:56:48.229 --> 03:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
with children
 
03:56:50.269 --> 03:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
um I I think that would be where it
 
03:56:52.010 --> 03:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
would fall under so the short answer is
 
03:56:53.990 --> 03:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
no not necessarily in accordance with
 
03:56:56.330 --> 03:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
the statute you could look at it you
 
03:56:59.030 --> 03:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
know uh I think that you know this
 
03:57:01.370 --> 03:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
alleged zoning issue would be something
 
03:57:04.210 --> 03:57:04.220 align:start position:0%
that would be related to familial status
 
03:57:06.530 --> 03:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
because essentially what you're saying
 
03:57:08.990 --> 03:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
with not wanting school-aged children is
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
you're not wanting families with
 
03:57:13.309 --> 03:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
children right so I think that's where
 
03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
um that would fall under and it wouldn't
 
03:57:17.630 --> 03:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
it would be sort of uh regardless of
 
03:57:19.790 --> 03:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
their race color national origin et
 
03:57:22.250 --> 03:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
cetera Etc so they so families could be
 
03:57:25.070 --> 03:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
possibly a protective class thank you
 
03:57:27.290 --> 03:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
yes okay representative hello
 
03:57:31.729 --> 03:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I'm not sure if this is a
 
03:57:33.889 --> 03:57:33.899 align:start position:0%
loud question or not but if not then you
 
03:57:38.090 --> 03:57:38.100 align:start position:0%
can uh follow up separately with me
 
03:57:38.100 --> 03:57:38.750 align:start position:0%
can uh follow up separately with me
um

03:57:38.750 --> 03:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:40.630 --> 03:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
if there is a municipality
 
03:57:43.010 --> 03:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
hypothetically that
 
03:57:43.020 --> 03:57:43.910 align:start position:0%
hypothetically that
um

03:57:43.910 --> 03:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:43.920 --> 03:57:46.550 align:start position:0%
um
that

03:57:46.550 --> 03:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:57:48.050 --> 03:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
um had
 
03:57:50.510 --> 03:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
um like a business come and say we would
 
03:57:53.929 --> 03:57:53.939 align:start position:0%
like to create a tattoo parlor in your
 
03:57:56.330 --> 03:57:56.340 align:start position:0%
state yeah or in your municipality do
 
03:57:58.429 --> 03:57:58.439 align:start position:0%
you have any regulations on that and the
 
03:57:58.439 --> 03:57:59.809 align:start position:0%
you have any regulations on that and the
municipality

03:57:59.809 --> 03:57:59.819 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
03:58:02.150 --> 03:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
quickly drafted a regulation saying to
 
03:58:04.189 --> 03:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
be a tattoo artist you had to be a
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
licensed physician in New Hampshire
 
03:58:09.370 --> 03:58:09.380 align:start position:0%
would that
 
03:58:12.170 --> 03:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
stray somehow into any of your buckets
 
03:58:13.729 --> 03:58:13.739 align:start position:0%
that is like you're trying to
 
03:58:13.739 --> 03:58:15.050 align:start position:0%
that is like you're trying to
discriminate

03:58:15.050 --> 03:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
discriminate
 
03:58:17.150 --> 03:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
tattoo parlors because it doesn't make
 
03:58:18.290 --> 03:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
any sense that they would need to be
 
03:58:20.389 --> 03:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
licensed positioned in the state of New
 
03:58:22.610 --> 03:58:22.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it
 
03:58:24.889 --> 03:58:24.899 align:start position:0%
I don't see it falling within our bucket
 
03:58:27.410 --> 03:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
okay however I mean it is there are
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
other staff statutory land there is
 
03:58:31.849 --> 03:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
other statutory language about
 
03:58:33.349 --> 03:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
um you know licensing and et cetera et
 
03:58:34.670 --> 03:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
cetera that that potentially could fall
 
03:58:37.250 --> 03:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
under I suppose
 
03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs uh just to clarify
 
03:58:42.710 --> 03:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
quickly uh families with children are a
 
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
protected class in New Hampshire yes I'm
 
03:58:46.309 --> 03:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
sorry did I not make that clear families
 
03:58:51.309 --> 03:58:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:53.570 --> 03:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
you know the minute it came out of my
 
03:58:55.250 --> 03:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
mouth representative Gibbs I was like I
 
03:58:57.290 --> 03:58:57.300 align:start position:0%
didn't know if that does that no yes um
 
03:58:59.450 --> 03:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
so in that sense children are protected
 
03:59:01.370 --> 03:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what race or national or
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
general right or
 
03:59:02.880 --> 03:59:04.370 align:start position:0%
general right or
whatever

03:59:04.370 --> 03:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:59:05.689 --> 03:59:05.699 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
03:59:08.809 --> 03:59:08.819 align:start position:0%
um uh just just one more uh follow-up
 
03:59:08.819 --> 03:59:10.309 align:start position:0%
um uh just just one more uh follow-up
question

03:59:10.309 --> 03:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:59:11.990 --> 03:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
03:59:13.910 --> 03:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
in order for
 
03:59:16.490 --> 03:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
um a complaint to be investigated by the
 
03:59:16.500 --> 03:59:17.929 align:start position:0%
um a complaint to be investigated by the
commission

03:59:17.929 --> 03:59:17.939 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:59:20.030 --> 03:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
um it can't just be discrimination
 
03:59:22.370 --> 03:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
against someone it has to be
 
03:59:25.070 --> 03:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination against someone that has
 
03:59:28.729 --> 03:59:28.739 align:start position:0%
either the intent or effect
 
03:59:32.929 --> 03:59:32.939 align:start position:0%
um of discrimination on the basis of one
 
03:59:35.929 --> 03:59:35.939 align:start position:0%
of the areas covered by the statute that
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
is a discriminatory effect not on say
 
03:59:43.070 --> 03:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
tattoo parlors but on businesses
 
03:59:46.370 --> 03:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
um uh that are very heavily patronized
 
03:59:49.070 --> 03:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
by people of a particular national
 
03:59:52.429 --> 03:59:52.439 align:start position:0%
origin or that serves almost entirely
 
03:59:55.370 --> 03:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities that could be a
 
03:59:57.889 --> 03:59:57.899 align:start position:0%
discriminatory effect under uh New
 
03:59:59.510 --> 03:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and federal law right so
 
04:00:01.070 --> 04:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
differing treatment has to have that
 
04:00:02.870 --> 04:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
intent right if I'm treating you
 
04:00:05.030 --> 04:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
differently based on your insert
 
04:00:07.189 --> 04:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
protected class here right there is an
 
04:00:09.229 --> 04:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
intent part of that I am intending to
 
04:00:11.150 --> 04:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
treat you differently disparate impacts
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit different right because
 
04:00:16.070 --> 04:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
disparate impact is looking at a potent
 
04:00:17.929 --> 04:00:17.939 align:start position:0%
what what is supposed to be a neutral
 
04:00:21.050 --> 04:00:21.060 align:start position:0%
policy a neutral law uh zoning ordinance
 
04:00:23.389 --> 04:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
Etc that is supposed to be neutral right
 
04:00:25.790 --> 04:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
and it's not so there's no there's no
 
04:00:27.950 --> 04:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
intent with disparate impact with those
 
04:00:29.750 --> 04:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
cases where
 
04:00:31.969 --> 04:00:31.979 align:start position:0%
um we're looking at policies
 
04:00:33.290 --> 04:00:33.300 align:start position:0%
um there is if we're talking about
 
04:00:35.330 --> 04:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
individual basis
 
04:00:38.210 --> 04:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
does that is that confusing follow-up
 
04:00:39.950 --> 04:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
and uh sorry
 
04:00:42.229 --> 04:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
um uh are we holding you up from your
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointment I do have to leave
 
04:00:46.309 --> 04:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
in about oh probably a minute and a half
 
04:00:49.729 --> 04:00:49.739 align:start position:0%
I was hoping okay uh I'll be as as fast
 
04:00:51.170 --> 04:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
as I can
 
04:00:51.180 --> 04:00:52.070 align:start position:0%
as I can
um

04:00:52.070 --> 04:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:55.550 --> 04:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
ah sorry
 
04:00:55.560 --> 04:00:58.910 align:start position:0%
ah sorry
um

04:00:58.910 --> 04:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:58.920 --> 04:01:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
if

04:01:02.150 --> 04:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:05.210 --> 04:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
sorry I've just I've just lost my train
 
04:01:07.309 --> 04:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
um I'll have to ask you this question uh
 
04:01:09.410 --> 04:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
directly later on my apologies it's okay
 
04:01:11.809 --> 04:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to if if you have
 
04:01:11.819 --> 04:01:13.130 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to if if you have
questions

04:01:13.130 --> 04:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:01:16.370 --> 04:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
um please you know either email Ani um
 
04:01:18.830 --> 04:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
or or myself or the commission and we
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
certainly will answer the question sorry
 
04:01:22.010 --> 04:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
I just got it back I'll be as quick as I
 
04:01:22.020 --> 04:01:22.849 align:start position:0%
I just got it back I'll be as quick as I
can

04:01:22.849 --> 04:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:01:26.689 --> 04:01:26.699 align:start position:0%
um isn't it possible sometimes rarely to
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
show intent by the series of events
 
04:01:33.050 --> 04:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
um and I'm speaking of the case that I
 
04:01:37.490 --> 04:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
had long ago uh at HUD where
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
um uh there was a change in the statute
 
04:01:43.130 --> 04:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
that would have required
 
04:01:47.330 --> 04:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
um a town to make a change in who it
 
04:01:50.630 --> 04:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
allowed and it would have brought in
 
04:01:54.469 --> 04:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
um a larger number of racial minorities
 
04:01:56.630 --> 04:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
from surrounding cities
 
04:02:01.849 --> 04:02:01.859 align:start position:0%
um based on the changes in uh the laws
 
04:02:05.510 --> 04:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
covering HUD assisted housing and the
 
04:02:08.269 --> 04:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
town as soon as this happened it passed
 
04:02:10.849 --> 04:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
a new ordinance essentially blocked
 
04:02:13.510 --> 04:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
talking that type of housing
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that conceivably show
 
04:02:19.010 --> 04:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
discriminatory intention yeah I I mean I
 
04:02:21.170 --> 04:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
think that that would definitely be that
 
04:02:22.729 --> 04:02:22.739 align:start position:0%
fact pattern would be a case that would
 
04:02:25.010 --> 04:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
be Doc could be docketed with us right
 
04:02:26.689 --> 04:02:26.699 align:start position:0%
um because it does show to that pattern
 
04:02:28.130 --> 04:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
I think that goes with representative
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
reads what what she was also saying
 
04:02:34.070 --> 04:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
um you know if it if that with that
 
04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
intent of the statute right you look at
 
04:02:37.550 --> 04:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
that fact pattern all the way through
 
04:02:39.769 --> 04:02:39.779 align:start position:0%
not just from especially if you're
 
04:02:41.750 --> 04:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
looking at a neutral policy you look at
 
04:02:43.550 --> 04:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
it from when the pilot why was the
 
04:02:45.410 --> 04:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
policy put in place you know where are
 
04:02:46.969 --> 04:02:46.979 align:start position:0%
we going with this policy what is the
 
04:02:49.130 --> 04:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
impact of this policy so that would
 
04:02:50.210 --> 04:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
definitely be something that was
 
04:02:51.710 --> 04:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
chargeable and sounds like it was with
 
04:02:55.010 --> 04:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
HUD so thank you great well thank you
 
04:02:56.450 --> 04:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
very much you're welcome and like I said
 
04:02:58.070 --> 04:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate it please feel free to you

have or any other assistance we can be
 
04:03:03.710 --> 04:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
um that's part of what we do and that's
 
04:03:06.050 --> 04:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
part of what we want to do we want to do
 
04:03:08.090 --> 04:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
more education than enforcement
 
04:03:09.650 --> 04:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
um frankly so
 
04:03:11.090 --> 04:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
um but please feel free to email us
 
04:03:12.590 --> 04:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you

say yeah thank you you're okay
 
04:03:19.429 --> 04:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
all right I think we're gonna take a two

minute break and then we're gonna hear
 
04:03:20.399 --> 04:03:21.530 align:start position:0%
minute break and then we're gonna hear
from

04:03:21.530 --> 04:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:03:23.630 --> 04:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
um Greg from Department of Housing or
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:34.969 --> 04:08:34.979 align:start position:0%
okay welcome back I wanna I wanna
 
04:08:37.370 --> 04:08:37.380 align:start position:0%

um to the special committee on housing
 
04:08:40.849 --> 04:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're used to being in this
 
04:08:42.469 --> 04:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
building frequently
 
04:08:43.790 --> 04:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
um but I
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you coming in to talk about
 
04:08:48.410 --> 04:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
um this is from the federal
 
04:08:49.790 --> 04:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
um Department of Housing and Urban
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%

04:08:53.450 --> 04:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Branch correct yes
 
04:09:00.370 --> 04:09:00.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:03.170 --> 04:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
there we go okay
 
04:09:04.790 --> 04:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have all this high-tech stuff
 
04:09:07.130 --> 04:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
when I was sitting in that chair when it
 
04:09:10.490 --> 04:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
was over there I guess it's been a while
 
04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
um I think it's been let's see
 
04:09:15.469 --> 04:09:15.479 align:start position:0%
1999 was the last time I chaired a
 
04:09:17.870 --> 04:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee hearing
 
04:09:19.849 --> 04:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
only because uh
 
04:09:22.370 --> 04:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
I was back for my from being down in DC
 
04:09:24.530 --> 04:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
for a couple weeks so
 
04:09:26.870 --> 04:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
um so I'm Greg Carson I'm the director
 
04:09:28.010 --> 04:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
of the U.S Department of Housing and
 
04:09:30.710 --> 04:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
Urban Development for uh the uh
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester Field office we go back and
 
04:09:36.349 --> 04:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
forth between calling them the state or
 
04:09:39.410 --> 04:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
the city so sometimes it's one state or
 
04:09:42.170 --> 04:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
one one city so uh but we've stayed
 
04:09:43.729 --> 04:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
consistent we are the Manchester Field
 
04:09:44.809 --> 04:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
office opposed to the New Hampshire
 
04:09:47.330 --> 04:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
field office for whatever reason
 
04:09:47.340 --> 04:09:48.349 align:start position:0%
field office for whatever reason
and

04:09:48.349 --> 04:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
um Meryl who I used to work with
 
04:09:52.790 --> 04:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
um had asked if I could come up and just
 
04:09:54.590 --> 04:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
talk for a couple of minutes
 
04:09:57.050 --> 04:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
um about some of the things that HUD is
 
04:09:59.630 --> 04:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
doing in terms of housing I'm more
 
04:10:01.130 --> 04:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
expecting you to ask questions than me
 
04:10:03.050 --> 04:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
to just kind of give you I mean I could
 
04:10:04.729 --> 04:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
give you a two-hour lecture on all the
 
04:10:05.929 --> 04:10:05.939 align:start position:0%
things that HUD does here in New
 
04:10:07.849 --> 04:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you'd be surprised that
 
04:10:10.130 --> 04:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
you know it's almost
 
04:10:13.130 --> 04:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
it's almost a billion dollars a year
 
04:10:14.630 --> 04:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
um in actual activity here in New
 
04:10:16.550 --> 04:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when you take a look at all of
 
04:10:18.830 --> 04:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
the FHA insurance for individual family
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
homes all the commercial FHA Loans Etc
 
04:10:21.600 --> 04:10:22.550 align:start position:0%
homes all the commercial FHA Loans Etc
so

04:10:22.550 --> 04:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:24.590 --> 04:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:10:27.650 --> 04:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
HUD has a few programs that directly get
 
04:10:31.130 --> 04:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
or the state gets direct funding for
 
04:10:33.469 --> 04:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
housing and housing activities
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
and the one thing to keep in mind is
 
04:10:38.269 --> 04:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the the funding that comes
 
04:10:38.279 --> 04:10:39.229 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the the funding that comes
in

04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:10:43.429 --> 04:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
is housing in the broadest terms if we
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
set aside all of the Section 8 and all
 
04:10:47.689 --> 04:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
04:10:50.210 --> 04:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
um uh housing authorities in New
 
04:10:51.830 --> 04:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority the
 
04:10:56.510 --> 04:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester Nashua Portsmouth there's 21
 
04:10:58.429 --> 04:10:58.439 align:start position:0%
of them here in the state if you set
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
aside the funding that goes to them
 
04:10:59.760 --> 04:11:00.969 align:start position:0%
aside the funding that goes to them
directly

04:11:00.969 --> 04:11:00.979 align:start position:0%
directly
 
04:11:03.290 --> 04:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
the remainder of the funding actually
 
04:11:05.150 --> 04:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
comes through various state agencies
 
04:11:09.229 --> 04:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
like cdfa or um Finance Etc
 
04:11:12.769 --> 04:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
and so we we put in about 50 million
 
04:11:15.889 --> 04:11:15.899 align:start position:0%
dollars a year into New Hampshire the
 
04:11:18.889 --> 04:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
last few years it was about half of that
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
prior to covid it will go back down much
 
04:11:24.410 --> 04:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
to the Chagrin of
 
04:11:26.090 --> 04:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
the governor it'll go back down
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 50 and say 24 million
 
04:11:31.010 --> 04:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
dollars because that's about how much
 
04:11:32.990 --> 04:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
we're normally putting into the into the
 
04:11:35.450 --> 04:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
state programs there's some of that
 
04:11:37.490 --> 04:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
money actually
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
gets divided by formula so in many cases
 
04:11:44.269 --> 04:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to say we a lot is it
 
04:11:46.130 --> 04:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
because it's just hard for me to say you
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
know the government or that we the
 
04:11:51.170 --> 04:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
states the people because I'm a taxpayer
 
04:11:51.180 --> 04:11:52.490 align:start position:0%
states the people because I'm a taxpayer
too

04:11:52.490 --> 04:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
um we get about 24 million dollars in
 
04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
funding some of that is as I said
 
04:11:59.990 --> 04:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
formula grant money which means
 
04:12:02.269 --> 04:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
we get the minimum amount
 
04:12:04.189 --> 04:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
based on our
 
04:12:07.250 --> 04:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
in the calculations for Grants are often
 
04:12:11.030 --> 04:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
done by a formula that was created 35
 
04:12:14.150 --> 04:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
years ago and it includes and it's a big
 
04:12:15.710 --> 04:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
secret how they do it every year and how
 
04:12:17.929 --> 04:12:17.939 align:start position:0%
they twist it around But it includes you
 
04:12:20.210 --> 04:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
know the age of the popular the age of
 
04:12:22.969 --> 04:12:22.979 align:start position:0%
the housing stock in the state
 
04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
um some of its you know population based
 
04:12:28.729 --> 04:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
um some of it's based on economic values
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
and that but it we end up a lot a lot of
 
04:12:33.889 --> 04:12:33.899 align:start position:0%
times getting like the minimum amount so
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example
 
04:12:38.090 --> 04:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
um almost two weeks ago the government
 
04:12:39.410 --> 04:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
the federal government did another
 
04:12:42.170 --> 04:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
allocation for
 
04:12:45.410 --> 04:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
um the Housing Trust Fund programs in
 
04:12:47.150 --> 04:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we've had a Housing Trust
 
04:12:48.650 --> 04:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
Fund program right now for
 
04:12:50.929 --> 04:12:50.939 align:start position:0%
five or six years I think that's about
 
04:12:50.939 --> 04:12:52.090 align:start position:0%
five or six years I think that's about
it

04:12:52.090 --> 04:12:52.100 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
no more than six years I think um it
 
04:12:57.170 --> 04:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
started off with some funding from the
 
04:12:58.510 --> 04:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
04:13:01.010 --> 04:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
that was going to International Finance
 
04:13:03.429 --> 04:13:03.439 align:start position:0%
Authority and then the state
 
04:13:06.830 --> 04:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
added created a state Housing Trust Fund
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
and there's finally that comes from the
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
legislature that does that
 
04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
the allocations for New Hampshire has
 
04:13:14.809 --> 04:13:14.819 align:start position:0%
always been about three to five million
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
dollars a year for the Housing Trust
 
04:13:16.560 --> 04:13:17.570 align:start position:0%
dollars a year for the Housing Trust
Fund

04:13:17.570 --> 04:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
Fund
 
04:13:17.580 --> 04:13:18.830 align:start position:0%
Fund
um

04:13:18.830 --> 04:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:20.929 --> 04:13:20.939 align:start position:0%
we've already done that allocation this
 
04:13:23.030 --> 04:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
year and we just uh the secretary
 
04:13:25.490 --> 04:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
announced it to be another five million
 
04:13:26.750 --> 04:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
dollars coming into actually three
 
04:13:28.210 --> 04:13:28.220 align:start position:0%
million dollars coming to the state
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
based on the formula grant process we
 
04:13:33.110 --> 04:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
probably would have ended up getting
 
04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
about 1.1 to 1.2 million dollars if we
 
04:13:39.110 --> 04:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
based it actually you know on uh the
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
other factors that are normally used in
 
04:13:43.610 --> 04:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
the grant so we met the minimum floor uh
 
04:13:46.010 --> 04:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
Montana of you know some of the smaller
 
04:13:47.870 --> 04:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
States Vermont that we all get the
 
04:13:47.880 --> 04:13:49.070 align:start position:0%
States Vermont that we all get the
minimum

04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
04:13:50.929 --> 04:13:50.939 align:start position:0%
um and so when that money comes in like
 
04:13:53.389 --> 04:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
that whether it's the annual funding or
 
04:13:55.550 --> 04:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
funding that comes in sporadically
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
presidential disasters things like that
 
04:14:01.189 --> 04:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
that funding is pretty Loosely tied to
 
04:14:04.130 --> 04:14:04.140 align:start position:0%
housing and that we give as much
 
04:14:06.050 --> 04:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
discretion as we possibly can to the
 
04:14:08.809 --> 04:14:08.819 align:start position:0%
state so that they can use the money in
 
04:14:10.969 --> 04:14:10.979 align:start position:0%
the way they feel it's best being used
 
04:14:13.429 --> 04:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest surprises
 
04:14:15.710 --> 04:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
um I got when I came to HUD I had
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
previously run um
 
04:14:21.650 --> 04:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh most of the U.S mints IRS Electronic
 
04:14:23.349 --> 04:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
Tax Administration and
 
04:14:25.370 --> 04:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
Medicare during the Bush Administration
 
04:14:27.469 --> 04:14:27.479 align:start position:0%
I was very surprised how I came to HUD
 
04:14:29.929 --> 04:14:29.939 align:start position:0%
was that HUD actually doesn't do any
 
04:14:32.809 --> 04:14:32.819 align:start position:0%
direct funding to individuals
 
04:14:34.969 --> 04:14:34.979 align:start position:0%
um they fund through other people they
 
04:14:36.950 --> 04:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
fund through banks they fund through you
 
04:14:39.530 --> 04:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
know state agencies and non-profits and
 
04:14:41.269 --> 04:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
there's a thing called the continuums of
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
care which are there's three here at New
 
04:14:47.030 --> 04:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one in Manchester one in
 
04:14:49.849 --> 04:14:49.859 align:start position:0%
Nashua and one they call the balance of
 
04:14:51.950 --> 04:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
state if
 
04:14:53.570 --> 04:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
we use balance the state a lot because
 
04:14:56.389 --> 04:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
if at city or town does not have Housing
 
04:14:58.130 --> 04:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
Authority they go to hedge Housing
 
04:14:59.929 --> 04:14:59.939 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority as they're provided
 
04:15:02.330 --> 04:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
for balance of state so these um
 
04:15:04.250 --> 04:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
continues of care actually make the
 
04:15:06.469 --> 04:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
decision it's the continuums are made up
 
04:15:10.550 --> 04:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
of local agencies the city
 
04:15:12.650 --> 04:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
um uh there's you know HUD provides
 
04:15:13.969 --> 04:15:13.979 align:start position:0%
technical assistance to the group and
 
04:15:15.130 --> 04:15:15.140 align:start position:0%
then you know usually there's so
 
04:15:17.450 --> 04:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
depending on which program is one of the
 
04:15:19.849 --> 04:15:19.859 align:start position:0%
HUD employees will participate but the
 
04:15:21.769 --> 04:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
idea is to let the cities and towns or
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
the state actually make the decisions on
 
04:15:25.610 --> 04:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
how to spend the money so even though
 
04:15:26.990 --> 04:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
something might be called a Community
 
04:15:28.910 --> 04:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
Development block grant
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
could be used to secure a piece of
 
04:15:33.889 --> 04:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
property or clear a piece of property so
 
04:15:36.050 --> 04:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
that housing could be built
 
04:15:38.210 --> 04:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
or you know you know Manchester's I'll
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
use Manchester as an example
 
04:15:44.389 --> 04:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
um when you get off of 293 on Queen City
 
04:15:48.830 --> 04:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:51.370 --> 04:15:51.380 align:start position:0%
I can't remember Queen City Bridge
 
04:15:54.769 --> 04:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
the bridge was redone with all HUD
 
04:15:56.030 --> 04:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
funding from the Community Development
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
block grants I mean that's very flexible
 
04:15:59.570 --> 04:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
I mean that money could actually even be
 
04:16:03.530 --> 04:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
used to invest in a business
 
04:16:03.540 --> 04:16:04.189 align:start position:0%
used to invest in a business
um

04:16:04.189 --> 04:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:07.370 --> 04:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
through cdfa or somebody else and can be
 
04:16:08.929 --> 04:16:08.939 align:start position:0%
used to just to make sure to increase
 
04:16:11.210 --> 04:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
the number of jobs that are available so
 
04:16:13.550 --> 04:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
the funding is can be used really
 
04:16:16.309 --> 04:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
flexibly so um
 
04:16:18.229 --> 04:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
like you said this you know
 
04:16:20.030 --> 04:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
um it has been about 24 million dollars
 
04:16:21.950 --> 04:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
a year it's last couple years have been
 
04:16:24.050 --> 04:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
50 million or so and those are big kind
 
04:16:25.670 --> 04:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
of round numbers and it's divided among
 
04:16:28.010 --> 04:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
multiple programs but um you know for
 
04:16:29.330 --> 04:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
the better part I mean I think that's
 
04:16:31.010 --> 04:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
the easiest way to kind of describe it
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to go through all the
 
04:16:32.040 --> 04:16:33.530 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to go through all the
individual

04:16:33.530 --> 04:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:16:35.689 --> 04:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
um programs themselves
 
04:16:40.670 --> 04:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
um so we also spend about 120 million
 
04:16:42.349 --> 04:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
04:16:42.359 --> 04:16:43.250 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
um

04:16:43.250 --> 04:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:45.550 --> 04:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
let's just see if there's excusing them
 
04:16:48.410 --> 04:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
about 180 million dollars a year total
 
04:16:51.229 --> 04:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
on housing that normally people would
 
04:16:53.870 --> 04:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
consider Section 8 which you know kind
 
04:16:55.189 --> 04:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
of has a negative connotation to it
 
04:16:56.389 --> 04:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
which it shouldn't because Section 8
 
04:16:58.969 --> 04:16:58.979 align:start position:0%
just happens to be the number in the uh
 
04:17:00.830 --> 04:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
the law that actually allows us to
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
provide um housing funding but Section 8
 
04:17:05.929 --> 04:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
can be individuals receiving a voucher
 
04:17:07.550 --> 04:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
which literally is a certificate they
 
04:17:08.990 --> 04:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
can take and go into the marketplace and
 
04:17:12.830 --> 04:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
rent an apartment it could be a
 
04:17:16.010 --> 04:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
um a for-profit or a non-profit Builder
 
04:17:18.349 --> 04:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
or a housing manager that owns a
 
04:17:21.290 --> 04:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
building and we've designated units
 
04:17:23.410 --> 04:17:23.420 align:start position:0%
within those buildings as Section 8
 
04:17:23.420 --> 04:17:24.969 align:start position:0%
within those buildings as Section 8
fundable

04:17:24.969 --> 04:17:24.979 align:start position:0%
fundable
 
04:17:27.530 --> 04:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
or it um it could be just the
 
04:17:28.790 --> 04:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
traditional what people think of the
 
04:17:31.429 --> 04:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
Section 8 housing where we funded
 
04:17:34.490 --> 04:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
um like uh Manchester housing authority
 
04:17:36.290 --> 04:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
has a number of buildings and number of
 
04:17:38.510 --> 04:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
Apartments dot dot so it can be the
 
04:17:40.130 --> 04:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
government building it could be the
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
local agency you know Manchester it
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
could be a non-profit families in
 
04:17:48.290 --> 04:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
transition Harbor care Etc or it could
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
be a an actual Builder Steve Lewis
 
04:17:54.410 --> 04:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
Builder uh was a one that we did a lot
 
04:17:56.929 --> 04:17:56.939 align:start position:0%
of low-income brand new housing being
 
04:17:58.250 --> 04:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
built down in Southern Southern New
 
04:17:59.510 --> 04:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
so that kind of sums up what we do at
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
least from the housing side
 
04:18:07.610 --> 04:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
um and uh I'm not sure what your
 
04:18:09.410 --> 04:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
interests are I've obviously followed
 
04:18:11.809 --> 04:18:11.819 align:start position:0%
the housing issues pretty closely
 
04:18:11.819 --> 04:18:12.469 align:start position:0%
the housing issues pretty closely
um

04:18:12.469 --> 04:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:14.450 --> 04:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
taught Taylor Castle everything he knows
 
04:18:16.070 --> 04:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
so all the stuff that happens over there
 
04:18:18.889 --> 04:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
in terms of housing
 
04:18:20.389 --> 04:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
um Taylor used to be the regional
 
04:18:21.950 --> 04:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
administrator for uh here in New England
 
04:18:23.570 --> 04:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:18:26.510 --> 04:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and so I and
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
um some of you may know I have a
 
04:18:31.130 --> 04:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
relationship with somebody in the that
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
other side of the building or
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the hall there
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
where there's only 24 people so um
 
04:18:40.370 --> 04:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
obviously I get a lot of questions from
 
04:18:40.380 --> 04:18:41.689 align:start position:0%
obviously I get a lot of questions from
people

04:18:41.689 --> 04:18:41.699 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
rep centers all the time and I try and
 
04:18:45.170 --> 04:18:45.180 align:start position:0%
be as helpful as I can
 
04:18:47.330 --> 04:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
um there's really not much that we do
 
04:18:49.010 --> 04:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
04:18:50.689 --> 04:18:50.699 align:start position:0%
um you know available publicly for
 
04:18:50.699 --> 04:18:51.490 align:start position:0%
um you know available publicly for
information

04:18:51.490 --> 04:18:51.500 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:18:54.410 --> 04:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of information both on
 
04:18:56.330 --> 04:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
the HUD website but also on the national
 
04:19:00.070 --> 04:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:02.210 --> 04:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
thank you are there are there questions
 
04:19:05.150 --> 04:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
for Greg yes represent McConkey thank
 
04:19:07.490 --> 04:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh Community block
 
04:19:09.950 --> 04:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
grants if you are I believe that's a
 
04:19:11.870 --> 04:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion and if you're not
 
04:19:15.590 --> 04:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
part of the 20 21 housing authorities
 
04:19:20.630 --> 04:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
does it my area up uh Carroll County is
 
04:19:22.969 --> 04:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
that administered who would
 
04:19:25.370 --> 04:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
who deter who do you make application to
 
04:19:26.630 --> 04:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
does that go through the regional
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission or to your
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
department so um I'll just a little bit
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
further explanation the Community
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
Development block grants are given to
 
04:19:39.670 --> 04:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
the state and entitlement communities
 
04:19:43.250 --> 04:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
again and you'll you'll recognize why it
 
04:19:45.110 --> 04:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
seems kind of goofy at this point
 
04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
um you know Manchester and Nashua
 
04:19:48.170 --> 04:19:48.180 align:start position:0%
obviously are entitlement communities
 
04:19:51.309 --> 04:19:51.319 align:start position:0%
because of the large their size but um
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
Dover Portsmouth Rochester
 
04:19:57.650 --> 04:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
um are also entitlement communities
 
04:20:00.530 --> 04:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
because you think about in the 60s the
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
Air Force Base was out towards the
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
Seacoast much bigger population the
 
04:20:06.410 --> 04:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
housing stock was very old so they get
 
04:20:08.150 --> 04:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
their own direct funding every other
 
04:20:11.269 --> 04:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
community in the state goes through cdfa
 
04:20:14.630 --> 04:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
for funding and
 
04:20:17.150 --> 04:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have entitlement counties here
 
04:20:18.530 --> 04:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so it is the cities
 
04:20:20.090 --> 04:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
actually applied directly to the state
 
04:20:21.889 --> 04:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
or cities or child Supply that directly
 
04:20:24.710 --> 04:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
through the state and in a lot of times
 
04:20:26.689 --> 04:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
it's money that they used to start a
 
04:20:28.490 --> 04:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
program where they're using multiple
 
04:20:30.530 --> 04:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
different programs of government to get
 
04:20:32.990 --> 04:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
stuff done which town do you live in
 
04:20:33.000 --> 04:20:36.170 align:start position:0%
stuff done which town do you live in
um

04:20:36.170 --> 04:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:38.210 --> 04:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
so um there's a couple of programs that
 
04:20:41.030 --> 04:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
um we actually did a Main Street program
 
04:20:44.050 --> 04:20:44.060 align:start position:0%
14 years ago in Ossipee yeah
 
04:20:46.250 --> 04:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
Community about block grant money thank
 
04:20:48.830 --> 04:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Gibbs thank you Mr
 
04:20:48.840 --> 04:20:49.849 align:start position:0%
you representative Gibbs thank you Mr
chairman

04:20:49.849 --> 04:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
um and thank you uh Mr Carson for coming
 
04:20:52.080 --> 04:20:55.189 align:start position:0%
um and thank you uh Mr Carson for coming
uh

04:20:55.189 --> 04:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:57.769 --> 04:20:57.779 align:start position:0%
just uh to clarify
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
um uh the entitlement communities
 
04:21:03.650 --> 04:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
um essentially receive their funding uh
 
04:21:06.769 --> 04:21:06.779 align:start position:0%
based on their population
 
04:21:09.170 --> 04:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
um and to some extent on their poverty
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
level population
 
04:21:13.610 --> 04:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
um and then uh non-entitlement
 
04:21:17.809 --> 04:21:17.819 align:start position:0%
communities uh can apply to the state
 
04:21:20.450 --> 04:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
um for a grant
 
04:21:24.110 --> 04:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
um and that usually a one-time grant for
 
04:21:26.870 --> 04:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
a year or two years
 
04:21:26.880 --> 04:21:27.530 align:start position:0%
a year or two years
um

04:21:27.530 --> 04:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:30.530 --> 04:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh and the uh community that isn't an
 
04:21:32.689 --> 04:21:32.699 align:start position:0%
entitlement Community would apply to the
 
04:21:35.689 --> 04:21:35.699 align:start position:0%
state with a proposal uh and that would
 
04:21:38.389 --> 04:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
be uh the cdfa that you were referring
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
to that's the
 
04:21:42.469 --> 04:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
um uh State Community Development
 
04:21:45.290 --> 04:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
Department essentially uh is that all
 
04:21:50.269 --> 04:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:52.130 --> 04:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
represent your color
 
04:21:53.510 --> 04:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:21:58.130 --> 04:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
um my I and I hope the interest of the
 
04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
committee is mostly about
 
04:22:04.610 --> 04:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
um barriers to housing in general that
 
04:22:04.620 --> 04:22:05.809 align:start position:0%
um barriers to housing in general that
that

04:22:05.809 --> 04:22:05.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:22:08.450 --> 04:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
um whether that be
 
04:22:11.210 --> 04:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
um development of housing
 
04:22:14.210 --> 04:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
um maybe even something that you might
 
04:22:16.189 --> 04:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
see about you know development of
 
04:22:19.570 --> 04:22:19.580 align:start position:0%
Section 8 housing or or just general
 
04:22:23.570 --> 04:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
housing barriers in in general anything
 
04:22:26.269 --> 04:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
that you have that you see that
 
04:22:29.210 --> 04:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
from your experience had is somewhere
 
04:22:32.229 --> 04:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
that we should look as far as trying to
 
04:22:37.189 --> 04:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
help alleviate or fix or or
 
04:22:39.650 --> 04:22:39.660 align:start position:0%
um incentivize
 
04:22:39.660 --> 04:22:41.210 align:start position:0%
um incentivize
um

04:22:41.210 --> 04:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:44.750 --> 04:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
what we describe as the housing crisis
 
04:22:46.969 --> 04:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire sure
 
04:22:50.090 --> 04:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
um I meant to literally bring my HUD hat
 
04:22:51.650 --> 04:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
with me
 
04:22:53.450 --> 04:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
so that I could take it off and put it
 
04:22:54.950 --> 04:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
on the table say okay you know what
 
04:22:56.510 --> 04:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about is not an
 
04:22:57.790 --> 04:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
official representation of the computer
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
I am not allowed to actually you know
 
04:23:02.929 --> 04:23:02.939 align:start position:0%
Advocate policy or testify or provide
 
04:23:04.670 --> 04:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
you know if you're testimony on any of
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
the four behalf of any kind of
 
04:23:08.450 --> 04:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
legislation I will just kind of take my
 
04:23:10.309 --> 04:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
hot my HUD hat off I mean I'm not going
 
04:23:11.929 --> 04:23:11.939 align:start position:0%
out of bounds or anything but
 
04:23:14.030 --> 04:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
um zoning board chairman in Londonderry
 
04:23:15.889 --> 04:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
for a decade I've been doing this for
 
04:23:17.929 --> 04:23:17.939 align:start position:0%
years I was on the committee one we did
 
04:23:19.790 --> 04:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing reinforced
 
04:23:21.950 --> 04:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing with the uh um the
 
04:23:24.290 --> 04:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
first right of refusal so I know a lot
 
04:23:26.269 --> 04:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
about housing so I'm going to add a
 
04:23:27.889 --> 04:23:27.899 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of things here that you know
 
04:23:29.750 --> 04:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
just don't generally revolve it just
 
04:23:31.969 --> 04:23:31.979 align:start position:0%
particularly in housing the official
 
04:23:34.729 --> 04:23:34.739 align:start position:0%
thing from position from HUD is that you
 
04:23:36.889 --> 04:23:36.899 align:start position:0%
know the idea is to lower one of our
 
04:23:38.929 --> 04:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
goals is to lower the barriers to
 
04:23:41.030 --> 04:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
development of housing that's just a
 
04:23:44.510 --> 04:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
general you know broad goal here in New
 
04:23:46.250 --> 04:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the limits
 
04:23:47.710 --> 04:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to use
 
04:23:52.490 --> 04:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
my own example uh the limits are really
 
04:23:56.990 --> 04:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
so dictated by the communities less so
 
04:23:58.729 --> 04:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
than the state um the state you know
 
04:24:00.229 --> 04:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's got you know broad General
 
04:24:02.090 --> 04:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
guidelines as to you know building codes
 
04:24:04.189 --> 04:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
things like that but it's usually it's
 
04:24:05.450 --> 04:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
the committee it's the communities
 
04:24:06.769 --> 04:24:06.779 align:start position:0%
themselves that actually have the
 
04:24:08.870 --> 04:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
largest influence as I said I was the
 
04:24:10.189 --> 04:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
chairman of the zoning board Monday for
 
04:24:11.990 --> 04:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
a decade and
 
04:24:15.050 --> 04:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:17.570 --> 04:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
when I first moved here in the
 
04:24:20.870 --> 04:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
um late 80s well 89 90 time frame
 
04:24:23.389 --> 04:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
um the housing market had just had a
 
04:24:25.550 --> 04:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
another kind of downturn
 
04:24:28.849 --> 04:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
um and so uh being an active person in
 
04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
the community on the budget committee
 
04:24:33.290 --> 04:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
that we came up with the idea to
 
04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
actually go out and buy all of the
 
04:24:36.830 --> 04:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
development rights for all the apple
 
04:24:39.769 --> 04:24:39.779 align:start position:0%
orchards in Londonderry so that nobody
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
could come in and build developments
 
04:24:44.570 --> 04:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
um because we're trying to limit you
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
know the amount of money that this the
 
04:24:48.110 --> 04:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
community would spend
 
04:24:50.929 --> 04:24:50.939 align:start position:0%
um we did that at the time because we
 
04:24:52.189 --> 04:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
thought that was a kind of the smart
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
04:24:54.950 --> 04:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
um we find you know
 
04:24:57.110 --> 04:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
20 years later or we'll go back and like
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
oh wait a minute we brought up all these
 
04:25:00.830 --> 04:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
development rights and we've basically
 
04:25:02.450 --> 04:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
just driven up the cost of housing in
 
04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
the local community and we've driven
 
04:25:07.070 --> 04:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
most of the development to be senior
 
04:25:07.080 --> 04:25:08.150 align:start position:0%
most of the development to be senior
housing

04:25:08.150 --> 04:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
so we ended up having from a dollar and
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
cents perspective we end up building
 
04:25:16.670 --> 04:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
more expensive housing in terms of the
 
04:25:19.870 --> 04:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
Town than we did had we and um not
 
04:25:22.429 --> 04:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
bottles development rights so it's
 
04:25:25.010 --> 04:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
zoning it's the cities and towns you
 
04:25:27.170 --> 04:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
know uh restrictive zoning
 
04:25:28.670 --> 04:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
um I actually think New Hampshire does a
 
04:25:31.370 --> 04:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
great job at zoning in general but um
 
04:25:33.950 --> 04:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
you know uh it's an easy thing to point
 
04:25:35.450 --> 04:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
a finger at when people are talking
 
04:25:37.550 --> 04:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
about the development of housing
 
04:25:41.570 --> 04:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
um uh if if you saw the housing Atlas
 
04:25:43.330 --> 04:25:43.340 align:start position:0%
that came out last week
 
04:25:46.130 --> 04:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
I think there's some flaws in that
 
04:25:47.990 --> 04:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
um and it's you really have to
 
04:25:51.649 --> 04:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
understand you know the um the zoning in
 
04:25:54.590 --> 04:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
each individual town and just kind of a
 
04:25:56.090 --> 04:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
little more you know more than just a
 
04:25:58.610 --> 04:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
cursory level of zoning in general to
 
04:26:01.010 --> 04:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
understand you know where all I think
 
04:26:02.990 --> 04:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
the percentages they're using when
 
04:26:04.490 --> 04:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
they're narrowing It Down based on what
 
04:26:07.130 --> 04:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
items they put in there are a bit well
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
actually I think some of them far off
 
04:26:08.159 --> 04:26:09.649 align:start position:0%
actually I think some of them far off
but

04:26:09.649 --> 04:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:26:12.130 --> 04:26:12.140 align:start position:0%
um the thing is there's develop a land
 
04:26:14.929 --> 04:26:14.939 align:start position:0%
and there are communities that you know
 
04:26:16.790 --> 04:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
tend to have
 
04:26:16.800 --> 04:26:18.170 align:start position:0%
tend to have
um

04:26:18.170 --> 04:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:21.830 --> 04:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
larger lot size Etc but many communities
 
04:26:24.410 --> 04:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
have adopted or are you know looking at
 
04:26:26.929 --> 04:26:26.939 align:start position:0%
things like planned um I think it's
 
04:26:29.630 --> 04:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
planned Urban Development let me give
 
04:26:31.610 --> 04:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
you example again Londonderry
 
04:26:33.889 --> 04:26:33.899 align:start position:0%
um we have on our
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
um uh zoning um our building plan to do
 
04:26:40.969 --> 04:26:40.979 align:start position:0%
to develop communities where the lot
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
size are as small as a quarter of an
 
04:26:45.530 --> 04:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
acre for single-family homes we have a
 
04:26:50.170 --> 04:26:50.180 align:start position:0%
separate area a separate zoning area for
 
04:26:52.849 --> 04:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing in the more older
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
traditional sense of manufactured
 
04:26:55.070 --> 04:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
housing where people think of mobile
 
04:26:58.130 --> 04:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
homes versus manufactured housing that a
 
04:26:59.870 --> 04:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
lot of mobile home or manufactured
 
04:27:01.309 --> 04:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
housing parks are being replaced with
 
04:27:04.070 --> 04:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
where they just bring over bring a one
 
04:27:05.870 --> 04:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
story Ranch and two pieces and they plop
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
it on the lot and on the on the
 
04:27:09.649 --> 04:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
foundation so it looks like more
 
04:27:11.870 --> 04:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
traditional housing and you talk with
 
04:27:12.830 --> 04:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
the Community Development Finance
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
Authority earlier so we did so
 
04:27:18.410 --> 04:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
those are you know it's it's more it's
 
04:27:19.910 --> 04:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
really the community levels that have
 
04:27:22.250 --> 04:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
you know anything that kind of restricts
 
04:27:24.170 --> 04:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
housing but there's still plenty of
 
04:27:27.349 --> 04:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
buildable land and lots here okay so if
 
04:27:28.910 --> 04:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
you could put your
 
04:27:31.790 --> 04:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
HUD hat back on I have a question
 
04:27:31.800 --> 04:27:32.870 align:start position:0%
HUD hat back on I have a question
regarding

04:27:32.870 --> 04:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
04:27:32.880 --> 04:27:33.649 align:start position:0%
regarding
um

04:27:33.649 --> 04:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:35.750 --> 04:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
HUD inspections Section 8 inspections I
 
04:27:38.510 --> 04:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
think we we talked about how you have a
 
04:27:40.189 --> 04:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
series of inspections that happen you
 
04:27:41.870 --> 04:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
have obviously if there's Section 8 or
 
04:27:43.309 --> 04:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
getting Federal money there's a federal
 
04:27:46.429 --> 04:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
inspection and then there's a local code
 
04:27:48.469 --> 04:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
inspection and then there's probably
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
something like can we talk about
 
04:27:52.070 --> 04:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
inspections is there a way to streamline
 
04:27:53.809 --> 04:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
it because I know the fact do the feds
 
04:27:56.929 --> 04:27:56.939 align:start position:0%
allow a municipality to be a certified
 
04:27:59.330 --> 04:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
HUD inspector where you know somebody in
 
04:28:00.950 --> 04:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
the municipality can inspect for you
 
04:28:02.210 --> 04:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
guys so it's maybe one inspection
 
04:28:05.570 --> 04:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
instead of 12.
 
04:28:05.580 --> 04:28:06.950 align:start position:0%
instead of 12.
um

04:28:06.950 --> 04:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:06.960 --> 04:28:09.290 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:28:09.290 --> 04:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:12.530 --> 04:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
every year to three years
 
04:28:12.540 --> 04:28:13.189 align:start position:0%
every year to three years
um

04:28:13.189 --> 04:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:16.550 --> 04:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh buildings that are you know
 
04:28:18.830 --> 04:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
owners who have housing that are
 
04:28:21.290 --> 04:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
receiving funding for Section Eight
 
04:28:23.110 --> 04:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
um have an inspection a react inspection
 
04:28:26.570 --> 04:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
and it varies and there's a risk
 
04:28:29.630 --> 04:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
management formula that decides based on
 
04:28:32.809 --> 04:28:32.819 align:start position:0%
previous you know scores the area the
 
04:28:35.149 --> 04:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
development um you know the community
 
04:28:38.450 --> 04:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
Etc on how soon that happens in there
 
04:28:40.370 --> 04:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
um HUD actually doesn't do those
 
04:28:43.429 --> 04:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
inspections we actually pay private
 
04:28:47.510 --> 04:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
inspectors to do that work and there is
 
04:28:49.070 --> 04:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
04:28:51.830 --> 04:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
Authority and
 
04:28:55.130 --> 04:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
um Keen Housing Authority particularly
 
04:28:57.170 --> 04:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
by the lead of you know with Keen in the
 
04:28:59.929 --> 04:28:59.939 align:start position:0%
lead they have looked at trying to get a
 
04:29:02.450 --> 04:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
certified kind of inspection so they
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
could combine those things
 
04:29:06.889 --> 04:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
um HUD would be fine I mean under HUD
 
04:29:06.899 --> 04:29:08.750 align:start position:0%
um HUD would be fine I mean under HUD
regulations

04:29:08.750 --> 04:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
04:29:11.990 --> 04:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
if the Hut of the inspection that HUD is
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
doing or is required the react
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
inspection is being done it would not be
 
04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
a problem for the state or the town to
 
04:29:22.189 --> 04:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
accept that same inspection the
 
04:29:24.649 --> 04:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
standards would have to uh wouldn't be
 
04:29:24.659 --> 04:29:25.729 align:start position:0%
standards would have to uh wouldn't be
amendable

04:29:25.729 --> 04:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
amendable
 
04:29:27.530 --> 04:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
um would you say this would you say the
 
04:29:29.510 --> 04:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
standards for the HUD inspection are
 
04:29:32.269 --> 04:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
more stringent or less stringent than a
 
04:29:32.279 --> 04:29:33.530 align:start position:0%
more stringent or less stringent than a
municipal

04:29:33.530 --> 04:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
04:29:34.729 --> 04:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:29:34.739 --> 04:29:35.870 align:start position:0%
all right
um

04:29:35.870 --> 04:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:37.490 --> 04:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
that would be a hard one to just save
 
04:29:38.990 --> 04:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
some of my head because I mean there's a
 
04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
lot of functionalities right right but
 
04:29:43.490 --> 04:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
it's not just that but the the S the
 
04:29:46.130 --> 04:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
inspection standards everybody's
 
04:29:48.170 --> 04:29:48.180 align:start position:0%
expecting inspecting the same thing as
 
04:29:51.830 --> 04:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
to what degree I I have actually seen
 
04:29:51.840 --> 04:29:53.030 align:start position:0%
to what degree I I have actually seen
where

04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:29:55.250 --> 04:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
one inspector tried to fail a building
 
04:29:55.260 --> 04:29:56.269 align:start position:0%
one inspector tried to fail a building
because

04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
um five Apartments had little pinholes
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
in the screens and the windows to allow
 
04:30:03.950 --> 04:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
mosquitoes and at the same time I've
 
04:30:06.410 --> 04:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
seen some housing that had mold and
 
04:30:07.370 --> 04:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
other stuff that would seem to be
 
04:30:08.510 --> 04:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
getting through inspections that
 
04:30:10.849 --> 04:30:10.859 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been getting through so
 
04:30:13.309 --> 04:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh the the inspection standards like
 
04:30:15.170 --> 04:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
appraisal standards whether it's for
 
04:30:17.330 --> 04:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
Federal Loan or state loan or you know a
 
04:30:19.910 --> 04:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
Community Bank all are pretty much the
 
04:30:21.950 --> 04:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
same kind of Standards there's very
 
04:30:24.830 --> 04:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
little change in between those
 
04:30:27.769 --> 04:30:27.779 align:start position:0%
so if I'm sorry to believe this if
 
04:30:27.779 --> 04:30:28.729 align:start position:0%
so if I'm sorry to believe this if
there's

04:30:28.729 --> 04:30:28.739 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
if they're all the same standard why do
 
04:30:32.809 --> 04:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
we have multiple inspections because the
 
04:30:34.490 --> 04:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
law requires multiple inspections
 
04:30:35.990 --> 04:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
because we have
 
04:30:38.090 --> 04:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
State inspectors and federal inspect the
 
04:30:39.710 --> 04:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
federal government as the funder is
 
04:30:42.410 --> 04:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
always going to have inspections up you
 
04:30:44.870 --> 04:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
know that are required by our standards
 
04:30:46.610 --> 04:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
think of it this way um you know the
 
04:30:48.229 --> 04:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
building codes there's a National
 
04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
Building Code there's a State Building
 
04:30:50.929 --> 04:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
Code and then there's a community
 
04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
building code they really need all three
 
04:30:54.889 --> 04:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
well normally it's all the enforcement
 
04:30:57.050 --> 04:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
that's done locally it's the same thing
 
04:30:58.969 --> 04:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
here with you know a federal inspection
 
04:31:00.469 --> 04:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
you know that's Federal inspection for
 
04:31:02.570 --> 04:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
react depending on you know how often
 
04:31:04.969 --> 04:31:04.979 align:start position:0%
they get it you've got the same issue
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
you've got the building inspector in
 
04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
this particular Community who's also
 
04:31:10.729 --> 04:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
given the same exact task to do the
 
04:31:13.130 --> 04:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
inspections so it's
 
04:31:14.510 --> 04:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
you're required at the state level
 
04:31:16.490 --> 04:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
required at the federal level and you
 
04:31:18.170 --> 04:31:18.180 align:start position:0%
know the communities then inspect based
 
04:31:20.750 --> 04:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
on their particular building code in
 
04:31:23.269 --> 04:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
town okay and that's why you have three
 
04:31:25.250 --> 04:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
now does it have to be three I think
 
04:31:25.260 --> 04:31:27.349 align:start position:0%
now does it have to be three I think
innovatively

04:31:27.349 --> 04:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
innovatively
 
04:31:29.570 --> 04:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
you should have I mean you have the
 
04:31:32.510 --> 04:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
oversight of two of those three so well
 
04:31:35.269 --> 04:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
if if you you know would make a law or
 
04:31:38.510 --> 04:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
enable municipalities to adopt the HUD
 
04:31:42.170 --> 04:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
the inspector would inspect those
 
04:31:45.469 --> 04:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
regulations and that would be
 
04:31:45.479 --> 04:31:47.269 align:start position:0%
regulations and that would be
satisfactory

04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
satisfactory
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
for Saint local is that something the
 
04:31:51.530 --> 04:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
legislature has to enable or and
 
04:31:53.570 --> 04:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
actually um the legislature and this
 
04:31:55.370 --> 04:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
committee actually
 
04:31:58.250 --> 04:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
um drafted and put forward to the house
 
04:32:00.649 --> 04:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
um to do exactly that on manufactured
 
04:32:02.229 --> 04:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
housing installations
 
04:32:04.610 --> 04:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
installation standards
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
um the committee had just adopted the
 
04:32:08.269 --> 04:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation actually the law was
 
04:32:10.130 --> 04:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
written kind of creatively so it just
 
04:32:13.570 --> 04:32:13.580 align:start position:0%
adopts the current federal law on
 
04:32:16.370 --> 04:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
installation standards great thank you
 
04:32:18.649 --> 04:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
representative uh yes thank you Mr
 
04:32:20.990 --> 04:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
Claire I just wanted to clarify
 
04:32:21.000 --> 04:32:21.830 align:start position:0%
Claire I just wanted to clarify
um

04:32:21.830 --> 04:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:23.630 --> 04:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
um what type of inspections you're
 
04:32:25.490 --> 04:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
asking about are you asking about the
 
04:32:27.889 --> 04:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
Section 8 voucher inspections in
 
04:32:27.899 --> 04:32:28.849 align:start position:0%
Section 8 voucher inspections in
particular

04:32:28.849 --> 04:32:28.859 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:32:31.610 --> 04:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
I mean those inspections seem are
 
04:32:33.889 --> 04:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
from what I know there's like 70 pages
 
04:32:36.349 --> 04:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
of things that a landlord would have to
 
04:32:38.269 --> 04:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
follow so right that seems like pretty
 
04:32:41.149 --> 04:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
strict but I think is there a different
 
04:32:42.889 --> 04:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
inspection that we're talking yes I
 
04:32:44.450 --> 04:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
think that our guest is referring to
 
04:32:47.630 --> 04:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
Section 8 um Building Inspections for
 
04:32:49.370 --> 04:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
Project based section eight there's a
 
04:32:52.550 --> 04:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
big difference between you know the um
 
04:32:54.349 --> 04:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
about your inspections and then the
 
04:32:57.110 --> 04:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
project-based inspections which go from
 
04:33:00.050 --> 04:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
floor to ceiling you know um just every
 
04:33:02.149 --> 04:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
every type of um
 
04:33:05.029 --> 04:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
regulation you can think of on housing
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
for your section 8
 
04:33:09.650 --> 04:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
voucher inspections are usually the unit
 
04:33:11.869 --> 04:33:11.879 align:start position:0%
and then limited common areas so there's
 
04:33:16.429 --> 04:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:18.109 --> 04:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
so I you know again I'm trying to make
 
04:33:22.789 --> 04:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
as broad as what we're trying to do so
 
04:33:26.269 --> 04:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
um yeah so there is there if the
 
04:33:28.250 --> 04:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
building like Manchester housing
 
04:33:30.650 --> 04:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
authority building or if a building is
 
04:33:33.890 --> 04:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
completely funded by Hud okay that is a
 
04:33:37.010 --> 04:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
much larger you know deeper a number of
 
04:33:40.689 --> 04:33:40.699 align:start position:0%
pages of detail to go through however
 
04:33:43.609 --> 04:33:43.619 align:start position:0%
every place everybody that has a voucher
 
04:33:45.769 --> 04:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
when they go to that building
 
04:33:47.330 --> 04:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
um so we don't actually I said we don't
 
04:33:48.709 --> 04:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
actually do the inspections same way
 
04:33:50.990 --> 04:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
that we don't actually issue the
 
04:33:51.000 --> 04:33:52.189 align:start position:0%
that we don't actually issue the
vouchers

04:33:52.189 --> 04:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
vouchers
 
04:33:54.051 --> 04:33:54.061 align:start position:0%
um we pay New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
04:33:56.090 --> 04:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
Authority or the Manchester housing
 
04:33:58.670 --> 04:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
authority or that to do those and so
 
04:34:00.410 --> 04:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
part of the process of somebody being
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
able to use their voucher in an
 
04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
individual apartment in the marketplace
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
04:34:10.910 --> 04:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
the unit has to pass the same health and
 
04:34:13.490 --> 04:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
wellness safety standards that you know
 
04:34:16.631 --> 04:34:16.641 align:start position:0%
any other unit would in terms of
 
04:34:20.570 --> 04:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
habitability and that is um we actually
 
04:34:22.189 --> 04:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
have Manchester housing authority does
 
04:34:24.289 --> 04:34:24.299 align:start position:0%
that for the most part New Hampshire
 
04:34:25.429 --> 04:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance Authority does that for
 
04:34:27.949 --> 04:34:27.959 align:start position:0%
the most part but um all of the other uh
 
04:34:29.570 --> 04:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
individual housing authorities do that
 
04:34:32.449 --> 04:34:32.459 align:start position:0%
also but there is a different set of
 
04:34:34.070 --> 04:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
inspections but it's all the same kind
 
04:34:36.051 --> 04:34:36.061 align:start position:0%
of things it's you know if the window if
 
04:34:37.849 --> 04:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
the you know if there's leaking there's
 
04:34:39.890 --> 04:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
mold there's not it's all the same
 
04:34:41.750 --> 04:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
general family of things it's just the
 
04:34:43.970 --> 04:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
checklist is much longer because we
 
04:34:46.609 --> 04:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
don't have the We the People the federal
 
04:34:49.551 --> 04:34:49.561 align:start position:0%
government don't have an interest in the
 
04:34:52.070 --> 04:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
actual Realty when it's at somebody's
 
04:34:53.929 --> 04:34:53.939 align:start position:0%
individual apartment or that where we do
 
04:34:57.529 --> 04:34:57.539 align:start position:0%
have that in terms of uh you know like a
 
04:35:00.529 --> 04:35:00.539 align:start position:0%
you know if if we've funded them a
 
04:35:00.539 --> 04:35:01.849 align:start position:0%
you know if if we've funded them a
building

04:35:01.849 --> 04:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
building
 
04:35:04.970 --> 04:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
um for non-profit or for a for-profit
 
04:35:06.830 --> 04:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
developer because we need to make sure
 
04:35:08.570 --> 04:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
that our investment all of our
 
04:35:10.490 --> 04:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
investments protected too so okay that's
 
04:35:12.170 --> 04:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
really the difference thank you uh
 
04:35:12.180 --> 04:35:14.689 align:start position:0%
really the difference thank you uh
representative

04:35:14.689 --> 04:35:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:17.209 --> 04:35:17.219 align:start position:0%
thank you I wanted to go back
 
04:35:20.330 --> 04:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
all the way to where you said the um
 
04:35:25.429 --> 04:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
town was buying development rights
 
04:35:25.439 --> 04:35:27.349 align:start position:0%
town was buying development rights
um

04:35:27.349 --> 04:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:30.410 --> 04:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
a couple of questions about that
 
04:35:30.420 --> 04:35:31.269 align:start position:0%
a couple of questions about that
um

04:35:31.269 --> 04:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
are they when you say the town is buying
 
04:35:37.250 --> 04:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
development rights is that kind of like
 
04:35:39.890 --> 04:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
buying like conservation rights or is
 
04:35:43.490 --> 04:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
that a different section of law or and
 
04:35:47.029 --> 04:35:47.039 align:start position:0%
is are those in perpetuity or are they
 
04:35:48.650 --> 04:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
able to sell them off and have they sell
 
04:35:49.789 --> 04:35:49.799 align:start position:0%
them off
 
04:35:49.799 --> 04:35:50.990 align:start position:0%
them off
those

04:35:50.990 --> 04:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:35:54.109 --> 04:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
yeah great question because when we did
 
04:35:55.429 --> 04:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
it originally we thought it was in
 
04:35:55.439 --> 04:35:57.051 align:start position:0%
it originally we thought it was in
perpetuity

04:35:57.051 --> 04:35:57.061 align:start position:0%
perpetuity
 
04:35:59.750 --> 04:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so at the time and I don't know the
 
04:36:00.890 --> 04:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
current state you know the current
 
04:36:04.010 --> 04:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
status of the law a town could go and
 
04:36:06.529 --> 04:36:06.539 align:start position:0%
buy negotiate for the development rights
 
04:36:08.631 --> 04:36:08.641 align:start position:0%
for a piece of property and it would be
 
04:36:11.209 --> 04:36:11.219 align:start position:0%
like a conservation trust where the
 
04:36:13.250 --> 04:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
landowner still can you know have their
 
04:36:15.709 --> 04:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
Farm their apple orchards golf course
 
04:36:17.869 --> 04:36:17.879 align:start position:0%
whatever the whatever they were using
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
that would qualify that property say is
 
04:36:22.070 --> 04:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know agricultural
 
04:36:24.109 --> 04:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
Etc but may also be called you know
 
04:36:25.730 --> 04:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
maybe like Illinois has a big huge air
 
04:36:28.310 --> 04:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
one zone all the Appalachians were in
 
04:36:31.310 --> 04:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
that ar-1 zone let me just when they
 
04:36:34.189 --> 04:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
developed the uh um the zoning in town
 
04:36:38.929 --> 04:36:38.939 align:start position:0%
so they were the town was purchasing the
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
rights to develop that land if and when
 
04:36:46.070 --> 04:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
the the land owner sold the land or
 
04:36:49.189 --> 04:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
decided they wanted to um excuse me on
 
04:36:51.170 --> 04:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
any transfer of the land any future
 
04:36:53.209 --> 04:36:53.219 align:start position:0%
development developer or anybody coming
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
in to buy it would be restricted on
 
04:36:56.810 --> 04:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
those same
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
um the same uh purchased rights that the
 
04:37:01.609 --> 04:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
town did so
 
04:37:03.709 --> 04:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
you know no single-family housing no
 
04:37:06.289 --> 04:37:06.299 align:start position:0%
multi-family housing no and there was a
 
04:37:07.789 --> 04:37:07.799 align:start position:0%
laundry list of items that they couldn't
 
04:37:07.799 --> 04:37:09.170 align:start position:0%
laundry list of items that they couldn't
do

04:37:09.170 --> 04:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:37:11.570 --> 04:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
um max apple orchards was a big huge
 
04:37:13.310 --> 04:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
Appalachian Londonderry
 
04:37:15.709 --> 04:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
um uh the town had bought development
 
04:37:17.330 --> 04:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
rights from
 
04:37:21.349 --> 04:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
um the owner there and
 
04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
35 years later the
 
04:37:26.929 --> 04:37:26.939 align:start position:0%
um the owner decided they went to buy
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
those rights back and there was an
 
04:37:32.170 --> 04:37:32.180 align:start position:0%
option to do so and pieces of land
 
04:37:34.551 --> 04:37:34.561 align:start position:0%
mostly so that other developments could
 
04:37:36.289 --> 04:37:36.299 align:start position:0%
be done including development that the
 
04:37:39.051 --> 04:37:39.061 align:start position:0%
town wanted could be you know purchased
 
04:37:42.170 --> 04:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
back by a developer coming in or the the
 
04:37:42.180 --> 04:37:43.131 align:start position:0%
back by a developer coming in or the the
original

04:37:43.131 --> 04:37:43.141 align:start position:0%
original
 
04:37:44.929 --> 04:37:44.939 align:start position:0%
um beneficiary of the payment from the
 
04:37:48.349 --> 04:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
town they could buy those rights back
 
04:37:51.410 --> 04:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
and I think the
 
04:37:54.590 --> 04:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
the position of the taxpayers in town
 
04:37:56.209 --> 04:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
it's softened a bit about making them
 
04:37:58.490 --> 04:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
you know in perpetuity because it was so
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
restrictive that there's a lot of
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
development that couldn't be done
 
04:38:04.310 --> 04:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
um in fact the um development that's
 
04:38:06.289 --> 04:38:06.299 align:start position:0%
going on at Exit four
 
04:38:08.090 --> 04:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
um in 4A
 
04:38:10.609 --> 04:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
um uh you know without being able to
 
04:38:12.109 --> 04:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
purchase some of those rights back they
 
04:38:13.910 --> 04:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't have happened
 
04:38:13.920 --> 04:38:15.051 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't have happened
so

04:38:15.051 --> 04:38:15.061 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Reed
 
04:38:19.310 --> 04:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:22.369 --> 04:38:22.379 align:start position:0%
um so let's say a property when it gets
 
04:38:25.010 --> 04:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
developed is using federal funds to be
 
04:38:28.010 --> 04:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
developed for affordable housing and
 
04:38:30.289 --> 04:38:30.299 align:start position:0%
after those initial inspections when
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's built
 
04:38:33.769 --> 04:38:33.779 align:start position:0%
um many years later
 
04:38:36.949 --> 04:38:36.959 align:start position:0%
and I in my experience it was like a
 
04:38:39.650 --> 04:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
limit of like fifth the the the federal
 
04:38:42.590 --> 04:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
funds came with a string of like 15
 
04:38:45.051 --> 04:38:45.061 align:start position:0%
years or 20 years or something like that
 
04:38:47.510 --> 04:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
depending on the program
 
04:38:49.609 --> 04:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
um but at that point they're no longer
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
maintaining to that level in other words
 
04:38:52.910 --> 04:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
they would not pass that inspection
 
04:38:55.730 --> 04:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
today what
 
04:38:59.449 --> 04:38:59.459 align:start position:0%
what uh recourse do residents have so
 
04:39:01.551 --> 04:39:01.561 align:start position:0%
typically what happens those kinds of
 
04:39:03.890 --> 04:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
property so
 
04:39:07.070 --> 04:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
just take one quick side step here so
 
04:39:08.689 --> 04:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
depending on the source of the funds and
 
04:39:10.490 --> 04:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
what the funds were intended for there
 
04:39:12.410 --> 04:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
could be as little as five years of
 
04:39:14.631 --> 04:39:14.641 align:start position:0%
restriction on what was done with the
 
04:39:16.730 --> 04:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
say like a building that was rehab for a
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
community center something versus 15
 
04:39:21.051 --> 04:39:21.061 align:start position:0%
years for a different program all the
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
way up to 40 years
 
04:39:22.920 --> 04:39:23.631 align:start position:0%
way up to 40 years
um

04:39:23.631 --> 04:39:23.641 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:23.641 --> 04:39:24.949 align:start position:0%
um
uh

04:39:24.949 --> 04:39:24.959 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
and there are actually a lot of
 
04:39:27.470 --> 04:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
properties out there with 40-year
 
04:39:29.449 --> 04:39:29.459 align:start position:0%
restrictions on you know the uh on the
 
04:39:29.459 --> 04:39:30.830 align:start position:0%
restrictions on you know the uh on the
buildings

04:39:30.830 --> 04:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
04:39:30.840 --> 04:39:31.510 align:start position:0%
buildings
um

04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:34.369 --> 04:39:34.379 align:start position:0%
the typically what happens is a lot of
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
communities that have their own housing
 
04:39:36.480 --> 04:39:37.510 align:start position:0%
communities that have their own housing
authorities

04:39:37.510 --> 04:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
04:39:39.890 --> 04:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
they'll come back and refinance those
 
04:39:41.690 --> 04:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
buildings with a new set of loans to
 
04:39:43.730 --> 04:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
rehab them to bring them up to standards
 
04:39:45.708 --> 04:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
I mean we give you know HUD actually
 
04:39:48.288 --> 04:39:48.298 align:start position:0%
designs incentives or congress designs
 
04:39:50.510 --> 04:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
incentives that HUD implements uh for it
 
04:39:52.368 --> 04:39:52.378 align:start position:0%
to do so so heating systems air
 
04:39:55.490 --> 04:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
conditioning systems there was a grant
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
for doing the light bulbs and things
 
04:40:00.050 --> 04:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
like that so a lot of those buildings do
 
04:40:02.690 --> 04:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
get brought up to standard because they
 
04:40:05.330 --> 04:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
they can't pass inspection anymore so
 
04:40:07.550 --> 04:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
they tend to stay and it's like I said a
 
04:40:09.470 --> 04:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
lot of housing that was built originally
 
04:40:09.480 --> 04:40:10.550 align:start position:0%
lot of housing that was built originally
for

04:40:10.550 --> 04:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:40:13.368 --> 04:40:13.378 align:start position:0%
um it could be section 202 or section
 
04:40:16.850 --> 04:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
811 which is senior disabled housing
 
04:40:16.860 --> 04:40:17.570 align:start position:0%
811 which is senior disabled housing
um

04:40:17.570 --> 04:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:20.510 --> 04:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
or you know could be you know um any of
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
the various versions of the Section 8
 
04:40:25.250 --> 04:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
funding and you want to get into like
 
04:40:27.410 --> 04:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
multi-family versus public housing
 
04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
funding Etc but generally the buildings
 
04:40:31.490 --> 04:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
that are publicly owned or those that
 
04:40:33.110 --> 04:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
are owned by non-profits and management
 
04:40:35.150 --> 04:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
nonprofits they go out to the
 
04:40:37.550 --> 04:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
marketplace in some cases um or they you
 
04:40:40.010 --> 04:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
know come back to HUD if they go if all
 
04:40:42.170 --> 04:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
of the restrictions have expired they
 
04:40:43.970 --> 04:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
can go to the marketplace and do that if
 
04:40:44.990 --> 04:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
there's still a lot of restrictions on
 
04:40:47.150 --> 04:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
them they come to us because we have to
 
04:40:50.510 --> 04:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
waive our first position on any um uh
 
04:40:50.520 --> 04:40:52.190 align:start position:0%
waive our first position on any um uh
claims

04:40:52.190 --> 04:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
claims
 
04:40:54.650 --> 04:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
and we actually did a program a number
 
04:40:56.690 --> 04:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
of years ago and there is the Keen
 
04:40:58.070 --> 04:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
housing authorities in a very unique
 
04:41:00.830 --> 04:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
position where they actually sold all of
 
04:41:00.840 --> 04:41:01.730 align:start position:0%
position where they actually sold all of
their

04:41:01.730 --> 04:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:41:01.740 --> 04:41:03.110 align:start position:0%
their
housing

04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:41:07.430 --> 04:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
to a non-profit which same director same
 
04:41:09.410 --> 04:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
board of directors Etc
 
04:41:12.230 --> 04:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
they're all now uh private they're owned
 
04:41:14.810 --> 04:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
by a non-profit which the Keen Housing
 
04:41:17.090 --> 04:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
Authority manages all of the units for
 
04:41:19.970 --> 04:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
them they place people in them and they
 
04:41:22.430 --> 04:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
were able to take advantage of any cost
 
04:41:24.590 --> 04:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
savings by running the program that way
 
04:41:26.150 --> 04:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
they were able to then take that and
 
04:41:27.890 --> 04:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
reinvest it in the buildings they were
 
04:41:29.930 --> 04:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
able to get private loans and they were
 
04:41:32.090 --> 04:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
able to develop more additional units
 
04:41:34.430 --> 04:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
without HUD funding whatsoever all from
 
04:41:36.170 --> 04:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
the non-profit that was formed it's
 
04:41:39.650 --> 04:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
called the moving to work program we
 
04:41:42.170 --> 04:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
tried to do that
 
04:41:45.708 --> 04:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
um again but it was the programs became
 
04:41:47.868 --> 04:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of restrictions so HUD did another
 
04:41:47.878 --> 04:41:49.010 align:start position:0%
a lot of restrictions so HUD did another
program

04:41:49.010 --> 04:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:41:50.510 --> 04:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
um that basically did that's a very
 
04:41:52.310 --> 04:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
similar thing where
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
um you know the Housing Authority could
 
04:41:56.690 --> 04:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
sell off their property to a non-profit
 
04:41:58.430 --> 04:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
that was you know I mean all kinds of
 
04:42:01.010 --> 04:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
strings attached obviously back to the
 
04:42:03.530 --> 04:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
city but they were able to uh go out and
 
04:42:06.650 --> 04:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh refund and refinance and rebuild
 
04:42:12.050 --> 04:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:14.208 --> 04:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
any more questions
 
04:42:16.190 --> 04:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much for coming and
 
04:42:17.570 --> 04:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
answering our questions and sure giving
 
04:42:18.490 --> 04:42:18.500 align:start position:0%
us a little bit more information
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and feel free to contact
 
04:42:22.010 --> 04:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
me if you think of something else you
 
04:42:24.830 --> 04:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
want to ask or send me an email it's
 
04:42:27.530 --> 04:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
kind of a broad generalized topic I mean
 
04:42:29.208 --> 04:42:29.218 align:start position:0%
it's so big that it's I can't cover it
 
04:42:31.430 --> 04:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
very much so it's a lot of information I
 
04:42:32.750 --> 04:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
mean we've been doing we've been days at
 
04:42:34.430 --> 04:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
this so
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
um is there anything that anyone would
 
04:42:37.310 --> 04:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
like to bring up before we adjourn for
 
04:42:40.090 --> 04:42:40.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:42.890 --> 04:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent Gibbs thank you um
 
04:42:45.410 --> 04:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
yes I I do just have a question
 
04:42:48.470 --> 04:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
um are we going to have a presentation
 
04:42:51.890 --> 04:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
from a state engineer on
 
04:42:55.490 --> 04:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
um things like septic Leach fields and
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
modern septic technology
 
04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
yes my plan is to bring in Des at some
 
04:43:03.830 --> 04:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
point but an engineer not like the top
 
04:43:05.810 --> 04:43:05.820 align:start position:0%
level Des but somebody that does the
 
04:43:07.730 --> 04:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
ground the engineering I think what we
 
04:43:09.288 --> 04:43:09.298 align:start position:0%
need as an engineer that's what I was
 
04:43:12.170 --> 04:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
asking about thank you perfect
 
04:43:14.330 --> 04:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
um I also have
 
04:43:17.570 --> 04:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
um distributed uh section
 
04:43:19.788 --> 04:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
some rsas to you one was one is
 
04:43:19.798 --> 04:43:21.470 align:start position:0%
some rsas to you one was one is
regarding

04:43:21.470 --> 04:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
04:43:23.570 --> 04:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
um local state and local building codes
 
04:43:27.410 --> 04:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
and collection of impact fees as well as
 
04:43:30.350 --> 04:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
state um
 
04:43:33.948 --> 04:43:33.958 align:start position:0%
uh building code so my intention is to
 
04:43:35.150 --> 04:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
um regarding uh what was brought up this
 
04:43:39.230 --> 04:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
morning with buildings that were built
 
04:43:41.390 --> 04:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
previous you know older buildings that
 
04:43:43.850 --> 04:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
may not run up to code maybe we could
 
04:43:46.190 --> 04:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
find somewhere where we could say any
 
04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
building that's built before 1950 could
 
04:43:51.288 --> 04:43:51.298 align:start position:0%
follow a different set of codes than the
 
04:43:52.430 --> 04:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
current one because if people are
 
04:43:55.368 --> 04:43:55.378 align:start position:0%
building to code at a certain new
 
04:43:58.128 --> 04:43:58.138 align:start position:0%
buildings to code the older ones are a
 
04:44:00.350 --> 04:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
lot smaller maybe more impactful maybe
 
04:44:01.970 --> 04:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
they have different staircases things
 
04:44:04.510 --> 04:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
like that so it might help
 
04:44:06.770 --> 04:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
redeveloping or rehabilitating older
 
04:44:09.170 --> 04:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
buildings if we can LAX up that code so
 
04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
I don't know anybody's thoughts on that
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
but it's definitely something I want to
 
04:44:14.150 --> 04:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
look at so I encourage you to take a
 
04:44:16.070 --> 04:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
look at it question or clarification so
 
04:44:18.650 --> 04:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
when we talk about um newer building
 
04:44:20.690 --> 04:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
codes on older billing codes could we
 
04:44:22.610 --> 04:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
talk about the lead paint
 
04:44:25.310 --> 04:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
um law which I think is a great example
 
04:44:28.208 --> 04:44:28.218 align:start position:0%
um right now any building built after
 
04:44:33.050 --> 04:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
1970 I think it's 1976 is uh does not
 
04:44:35.690 --> 04:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
have lead and that's sort of like a a
 
04:44:38.570 --> 04:44:38.580 align:start position:0%
break off any building before possibly
 
04:44:41.810 --> 04:44:41.820 align:start position:0%
has fled is that one way to look at that
 
04:44:43.610 --> 04:44:43.620 align:start position:0%
that is certainly something I'm willing
 
04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
to entertain
 
04:44:47.330 --> 04:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
um the lead maybe that's the date you
 
04:44:48.830 --> 04:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
know maybe that is the one we pick but
 
04:44:50.390 --> 04:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just throwing out an arbitrary date
 
04:44:52.490 --> 04:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
for that but
 
04:44:55.610 --> 04:44:55.620 align:start position:0%
not building codes but you mentioned
 
04:44:59.390 --> 04:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
impact fees are in the same handout uh
 
04:45:03.470 --> 04:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
based on our earlier presentation and
 
04:45:06.650 --> 04:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
the negative or cooling effect of impact
 
04:45:08.930 --> 04:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
fees and other similar fees I'm
 
04:45:10.788 --> 04:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
wondering if it wouldn't be an
 
04:45:13.550 --> 04:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
interesting idea to have a like
 
04:45:15.230 --> 04:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
prohibition on impact fees for
 
04:45:16.970 --> 04:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
developers who were specifically
 
04:45:20.510 --> 04:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
developing affordable housing
 
04:45:23.570 --> 04:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
or maybe just a discount something like
 
04:45:23.580 --> 04:45:25.128 align:start position:0%
or maybe just a discount something like
that

04:45:25.128 --> 04:45:25.138 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:45:26.990 --> 04:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and there's I'm trying to look at the
 
04:45:30.050 --> 04:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
one Nate's just sent it to me
 
04:45:32.810 --> 04:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
so it in in what you can charge an
 
04:45:35.628 --> 04:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
impact fee for right so
 
04:45:37.250 --> 04:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
um there's some that make sense and
 
04:45:38.448 --> 04:45:38.458 align:start position:0%
there's some that don't but I will leave
 
04:45:40.310 --> 04:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
it up to the committee to figure that
 
04:45:41.750 --> 04:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
out but I'd like to look into that as
 
04:45:41.760 --> 04:45:43.970 align:start position:0%
out but I'd like to look into that as
well

04:45:43.970 --> 04:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:45.830 --> 04:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
great all right well thank you everyone
 
04:45:48.070 --> 04:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
we're returning for the oh representing
 
04:45:50.570 --> 04:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
we don't have a meeting scheduled yet so
 
04:45:56.230 --> 04:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:56.240 --> 04:45:58.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:45:58.030 --> 04:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:46:00.590 --> 04:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
we will probably pick
 
04:46:02.330 --> 04:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
um Tuesdays or third Tuesdays or
 
04:46:03.650 --> 04:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
Thursdays now that committees don't need
 
04:46:05.208 --> 04:46:05.218 align:start position:0%
free as frequently
 
04:46:07.610 --> 04:46:07.620 align:start position:0%
um we should have access to these rooms
