um thank you all for being here I know
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's early on Friday after a long
 
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
session day yesterday um but uh we have
 
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
uh Steve Petty Steven Petty here um he
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
is uh come to talk to us about some of
 
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
the covid
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
protocols uh and I cannot even begin to
 
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
introduce him and do him justice so I
 
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
will just let him if you don't mind
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself and your
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
many thank you very much um first of all
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Stephen Petty and I I just
 
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
have a couple of opening remarks I'd
 
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
like to thank uh uh chairman Barbara
 
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879 align:start position:0%
coma as well as the committee for the
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
chance to speak this morning uh and I
 
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
think I'll provide you with a long uh
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
but quick summary of the actual science
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
on masking social distancing harms
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
caused by both and what are the real
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
solutions and I've actually implemented
 
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
those I've been doing this on a pro bono
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
basis now for four years um spoke to
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
dozens of not hundreds of folks uh to
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
try to to put the right Solutions in
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
place uh my goal over the next hour or
 
00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
so is to quickly cover materials which
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
I've provided to you um and then have
 
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
time to take questions this is a little
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
different group so if there's something
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
that um subject to the Chairman's
 
00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.519 align:start position:0%
instructions if you would like to ask a
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
question at some point in the slide I
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
think we have the time to do so maybe
 
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.630 align:start position:0%
think we have the time to do so maybe
that's

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:13.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate um yes if anyone would like
 
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
to do that um let me first say that my
 
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.630 align:start position:0%
to do that um let me first say that my
overall

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
overall
 
00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:22.519 align:start position:0%
um uh position uh as a subject matter
 
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:24.519 align:start position:0%
expert on exposure exposure control and
 
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
personal protective equipment is
 
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
that uh you'll find that the science on
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
masking social distancing is not
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
supported by the science going back over
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
hundred years and actually causes great
 
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
harm to both adults and children but the
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
real solution has been the solution
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's existed for almost a hundred
 
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
years which is engineering controls and
 
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
that it's very simple it's diluted
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
filtered out or kill it and I'm going to
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
show you actual technologies that I've
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
implemented and followed uh both in
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
terms of what they are and what they
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
cost um
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm not a big fan of talking about
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
qualifications because I've been working
 
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
now 45 years which is too long I need to
 
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
retire but um here are a few um I'm a
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
professional engineer in Six States um
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
I'm what they're called a certified
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
industrial hygienist which is a high
 
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
level expert on health and safety and
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
I'm a certified Safety Professional I
 
00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
think there's only a couple hundred of
 
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
us that have all three credentials in
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
the United
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
States as I will show medic medical
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
doctors are not subject matter experts
 
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
for exposure and exposure control and
 
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:36.519 align:start position:0%
PPE this is not well understood by the
 
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
public uh in my 45 years of
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
experience uh including the last 20
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
testifying in nearly 400 cases
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
named um I've never had a medical doctor
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
do my job that is to do exposure levels
 
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
exposure control and PE person
 
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959 align:start position:0%
protective uh they with equipment what
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
they do is they take my exposure and
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
they make a determination as to whether
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
or not that cause their disease so
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we have a lot of
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
Physicians and they may be super well
 
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
qualified in their own areas but they
 
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
talk a lot about exposure and exposure
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
control and frankly the vast majority
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't know what they're talking
 
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
about um I've sampled for all manner of
 
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
pathogens Anthrax biotoxins dioxin
 
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
pesticides mold bacteria voc's Benzene
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
asbest Etc so I'm actually a Hands-On
 
00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:28.519 align:start position:0%
guy I'm not just a person that will talk
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
to you about
 
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh some of the academic sides of it
 
00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:32.839 align:start position:0%
although I certainly worked in that area
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
as well um for the past 20 years as I
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
said I've been in disclosed I've worked
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
on more disclosed in over 400 cases on
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
exposure control PPE and warnings the
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
most recently I was selected as the
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
expert for the East Palestine train
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
accident so I'm the lead expert on that
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
as well as I'm the I've been selected to
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
be the exposure expert on Roundup
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
paraquat uh C8 the first of the I was on
 
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
stand and four trials for 12 days for
 
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
those as well as the P forever chemicals
 
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
Arena I'm the expert on that for the 3M
 
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
case that just settled for 12 billion as
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
well as U I'm now I was named yesterday
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
as expert for the state of North
 
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.310 align:start position:0%
as expert for the state of North
Carolina

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
Carolina
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
work um it should be noted that while
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
I've spent almost all my career
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
protecting workers in the public if I
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
thought for a minute that m
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh or n95s would protect individuals or
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
the public from a virus I'd be right
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
there that's been my job my whole
 
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
career and they don't it's a fraud it's
 
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
a complete fraud on the public and I'll
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
show you this there are real solutions
 
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
and I think it the masking came from the
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
concept that some folks were um using
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
the concept that we all want to try to
 
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
do our part and help in a pandemic and
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
they they played on people's desire to
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
help as opposed to what the real science
 
00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
was with that um let me get started
 
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.030 align:start position:0%
was with that um let me get started
[Music]

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
um I just want to spend a second talking
 
00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
about industrial hygiene
 
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
because there's there's only about
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
10,000 industrial hygienist which you
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
div to 50 states it's about 200 that are
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
certified and it's really the Art and
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
Science science associated with the
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
anticipation recognition evaluation
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
control of things that will make you
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
sick make you uncomfortable and even
 
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.710 align:start position:0%
sick make you uncomfortable and even
kill

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
kill
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
you and that's our job we we go into the
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
field if people aren't feeling good or
 
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
there's a problem or people have died we
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
try to figure out what it was that that
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh hurt them or killed them and what can
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
we do to stop it and so we we unlike the
 
00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:54.519 align:start position:0%
medical field we have to take this world
 
00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
of things that could be impacting people
 
00:13:59.069 --> 00:13:59.079 align:start position:0%
and winnow it down and then use the r
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
reports are used by the medical
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
community to see whether or not it
 
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.069 align:start position:0%
 
individual

00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
um let me see if I can move this so it's
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
a field associated with uh exposure
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
personal protective equipment and
 
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
warnings and it's as I said it's it's
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
the problem is of course the media is
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
dependent upon MDS to talk about
 
00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:22.839 align:start position:0%
industrial hygiene issues and that's
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
been a problem uh as I said earlier in
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
all of my exposure cases I've never had
 
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
an MD my job and uh so that's just it
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
needs to the public needs to understand
 
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
there is a difference now let's talk
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
real quickly about
 
00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:42.279 align:start position:0%
masking does it work or not and it
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
really can be evaluated two levels the
 
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
first level is the macro or
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
epidemiological level I call it the
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
10,000 foot level and that's what most
 
00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
of the public has heard about and then
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's the micro level the industrial
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
hygiene level and it's generally not
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
understood by the public but we're going
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
to talk about it real quick
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
this uh slide and like you'll find on
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
all these slides what I've tried to do
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
on the bottom is I put URLs so that if
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
you want to independently look at
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
anything I've
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
said those links will gift you right to
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
the original studies or the original
 
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
information um I try to be fully
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
transparent and all this so this is a
 
00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
plot for New Hampshire and you can do
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
this for any state and I have um of the
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
cases of covid with time and if you
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
thought especially in the early days
 
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
that masking would do some good then you
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
would expect that cases would drop as
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
soon as masks mandates were implemented
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
but they don't what you tend to see here
 
00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
is that in Northern climates they peak
 
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
in the winter months guess what when
 
00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
people are trapped
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
indoors um and then they in the southern
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
climates you tend to have some peaks in
 
00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
the summer when people are indoors with
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
air conditioning in the southern
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
hemisphere it's just the opposite and
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
what these curves really are what's a
 
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
concept called fars curve and this was
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
from Dr far in 1836 seven and and what
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
he showed this I'll show this next plot
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
is that diseases tend to the cases tend
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
to rise rapidly reach a peak and then
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
Decay away this is the concept of fars
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
curve so interestingly enough I've
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
overlaid some Mass mandates in in
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
California on the fars curve uh and you
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
see that they were implemented on the on
 
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
the left side or beginnings of the
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic and guess what they really were
 
00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
effective weren't they the case is
 
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed um now if they had have been
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
really clever they would have
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
implemented them on the backs side of
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
the farest curve because then the cases
 
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
would have dropped but I don't think it
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
masking let's talk about epidemiological
 
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
the 10,000 foot
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
level the
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
uh and by the way as a certified
 
00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
industrial hygienist I'm an expert in 18
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
disciplines including toxicology and
 
00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:59.670 align:start position:0%
disciplines including toxicology and
epidemiology

00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
epidemiology
 
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
um the probably the uh the best studies
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
that you can look at are what they call
 
00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
randomized control trials and they says
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
where you have a group two groups one as
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
similar as can be in one group you
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
implement a change on the other you
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
don't and you see in this case if you
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
added Mass to half a group and not to
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
the other half does a rate at which they
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
get infected say with covid change at
 
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.510 align:start position:0%
get infected say with covid change at
least

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
least
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
statistically and um the least desirable
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
studies what we call observational
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
studies well I had a friend that did
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
this and they didn't get sick or did get
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
sick you know that's not there could be
 
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
all kinds of factors that impact why
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
they got sick or where they were um
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
Cochrane did a study recently where
 
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
Jefferson was the primary author where
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
they did a meta study of the rcts
 
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
related to masking both mass and
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
n95s and um an art so what they did is
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
they looked at all the rcts as a group
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
they call that that's about the best
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
find and I'll just read
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
this medical surgical mask versus no
 
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
mask wearing masks in a community
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
probably makes little or no difference
 
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
to the outcome of laboratory confined
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
covid versus not wearing a mask and then
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
what did they say about
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
n95s well the n95s were comparable to
 
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
surgic masks I.E they didn't do any
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
better than no masks in fact I'll show
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
you a study coming up where masks
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
actually do more harm than not wearing a
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
mask with respect to
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
co so um he based his meta analysis on a
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
series of studies one was the bunder
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
guard study out of Denmark may I ask a
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
question really quickly yes ma'am is
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
this the study that was released in a
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
with data from April
 
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.149 align:start position:0%
with data from April
2020

00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh are you referring to something I have
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
here I'm sorry no I'm just looking up
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
Jefferson at all cockran study and it
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
looks like this was released well it was
 
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
published in November 2020 but they were
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
only looking at studies done prior to
 
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
April 2020 so I'm just wondering about
 
00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:22.039 align:start position:0%
how Rel these are no no this one isn't
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
there was an initial rain study but
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
this is the followup I think it
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
published in the fall of
 
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.350 align:start position:0%
published in the fall of
2023

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
uhhuh yeah I know what you're talking
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
about that's an early study earlier
 
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.390 align:start position:0%
about that's an early study earlier
one

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
um the bunder guard study and again the
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
URLs here if you want to look at
 
00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
yourself they looked at roughly 6,000
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
people 3,000 with mass 3,000 without
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
masks the bottom line was that masking
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have an effect on reducing rates
 
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.270 align:start position:0%
didn't have an effect on reducing rates
of

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
covid Benny spear in Europe looked at
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
this is busy I understand but bottom
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
line is he he correlated um rate of mask
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
wearing by country versus deaths from
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
covid and what he found was countries
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
with the highest rate of maske wearing
 
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
covid similarly in us uh fogan did the
 
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
same thing with counties in Kansas and
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
found the same thing that those counties
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
with highest rates of mask wearing were
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
um had the highest rates of covid
 
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.830 align:start position:0%
um had the highest rates of covid
deaths

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:32.919 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that that uh and we
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
know this as an industrial
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
hygienist the mask is a perfect breeding
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
ground for amplification of bacteria
 
00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
molds even some trap virus because it
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
provides a for those elements that are
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
breathed out and contained it has
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
perfect conditions of temperature and
 
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
humidity for amplification of mold
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
bacteria Etc to give you an examp
 
00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
example if you can't see mold on a wall
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
you know there's no visible mold we've
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
all seen visible mold on things the
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
support count is on the order of 10,000
 
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
spores per square inch or less that's
 
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
background but if you see mold you
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
actually can see it the counts are over
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
a million so we're not talking about
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
going from less than 10,000 to 20,000
 
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
when you start to see it we're talking
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
about massive increases exponential
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
increases so what happens to somebody is
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
that if you wear a mask you're to some
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
degree you're breathing out always
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
breathing out pathogens uh whether it be
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
strep or or all kinds of things and
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
they're released at low levels uh the
 
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0%
body's constantly fighting off things
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
but if they're trapped on this mask and
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
then they amplify by a factor of a 100
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
and then they're
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
rebreathed it's no surprise your immune
 
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
system is being challenged and weakened
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
so you're going to be more susceptible
 
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
to opportunistic diseases and that's
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
what this study shows this is a December
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
2023 paper pretty
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
recent and it says basically that um
 
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to see rates of increase in
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
covid of between 33 and
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
40% higher if you wear a mask versus not
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
wearing a
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
mask that's not a surprise to me because
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
you would expect
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
that how about masking in schools do
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
they work series of studies on this um
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
Florida schools they had schools
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
districts where Mass were warn versus
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
school districts where they were
 
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
not um this is busy I understand it but
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
basically These Bars um are the air
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
bands and then the data for people with
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
mask and without mask and the data
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
difference very recently there was a
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
study um published in 20 late
 
00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:57.799 align:start position:0%
2023 by S hikes Stevenson and hog and
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
they had a really unique situation they
 
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
had two school districts Fargo and West
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
Fargo North Dakota one District required
 
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
masks the other did not and this is a
 
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
plot of cases of disease with time in
 
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
those districts of course you see the
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
forest curve kick off we're in the dead
 
00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:15.559 align:start position:0%
of winter you have the most
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.039 --> 00:23:23.669 align:start position:0%
 
difference

00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
now the issue with respect to children
 
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
and masking and this an issue I've been
 
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
pounding on for 3 or four years and I'll
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
talk more about this in a
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
second they look this is a a detailed
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
analysis of uh in 2023 now of impacts on
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
children um one they say the science
 
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
does not support the use of masks for
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
covid for children and two it causes
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
great harms uh I should add that I got
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
involved in this in the fall of 2020
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
when a school special needs high school
 
00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
with 900 autistic children in
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
Westerville Ohio contacted me the school
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
Master did Dr Morrison and she said I I
 
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to put the kids in Mass it
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
they won't wear them and it'll hurt
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
their learning because they really
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
depend on seeing people uh speaking and
 
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
and watching their
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
faces what can we do and I said well
 
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
we'll do the same thing we always did
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll increase the Fresh Air
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
Supply we'll impact your humidity
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
control in the in the shoulder months
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
fall and and spring and then we're going
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
to put in new Co uh new Calon eyeway
 
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
which I don't think has a lot of side
 
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
effects but destroys 99% of the virus
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
mold in bacteria and um that's what we
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
did we had a lot of push back as you can
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
well imagine from the state of Ohio
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
Education in the um fall of 2020 this
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
was a time where people were petrified
 
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.710 align:start position:0%
was a time where people were petrified
about

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
covid um and um we did it anyway
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
the state let us do it we had almost no
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
covid in fact the only time they had an
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
outbreak of covid was after an incident
 
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
where the maintenance people came in and
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
changed out the filters but forgot to
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
turn the systems back
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
on and as soon as they turned them back
 
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
on the the co rate dropped to nothing
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
the more important point is now three
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
years later the test scores have
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
remained at or above what they were
 
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.310 align:start position:0%
remained at or above what they were
before

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
covid now what you'll find in districts
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
where they wore masks and did social
 
00:25:29.389 --> 00:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
distancing you see upwards of a quarter
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
year per year of Education
 
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:40.039 align:start position:0%
sad so the other the other thing and
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
I've testified in federal court on this
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
um everybody wants to cite the CDC
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
studies almost all of them cited for
 
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
covid are not randomized control studies
 
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.549 align:start position:0%
covid are not randomized control studies
they're

00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:51.559 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
observational what's that mean they
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
don't have a control group that is a
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
group that not wearing masks versus a
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
group that is wearing masks
 
00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
and moreover they have co-founding
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
factors meaning that they're not
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
controlling for other things in other
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
words does the difference is it they may
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
be wearing masks but are they also doing
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
quarantining of sick people social
 
00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
distancing changing the HVAC system Etc
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're changing all those
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
things how do you know what the impact
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
the mask will have you
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
don't um and what's fascinating is in
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
May of 20 I think it's March or may of
 
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
2020 CDC put out out a meta study on
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
whether or not masking helped uh stop
 
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
cases of influenza now viruses by and
 
00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:39.799 align:start position:0%
large are all the same size they're very
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
small I'll show this in a second and
 
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
they concluded conclusively they made no
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
difference it just seems to be that that
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
within two or three months they lost
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
published now I appreciate that I'm an
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
expert on on protecting workers in the
 
00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.789 align:start position:0%
expert on on protecting workers in the
public

00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
so this sometimes comes as a surprise to
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
people that I would be against masking
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
but the reality
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
is and for things that actually help
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
people not things that hurt people um if
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
you don't mind just a quick question so
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
we see a lot of times um in hospital
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
settings and things um that people are
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
wearing masks and sometimes they're not
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
um and from what I'm understanding what
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying is a lot of these viruses
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
cannot be um you cannot be protected
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
from Mass no matter where you are is
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
that correct is that an assumption am I
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
understanding it correctly yeah there's
 
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
and this has led to confusion and and
 
00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:47.519 align:start position:0%
for good reason the reason that doctors
 
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
wore sucal masks is to stop against
 
00:27:54.029 --> 00:27:54.039 align:start position:0%
large droplets of blood and body fluids
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
now all particles can be split into two
 
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
camps the big guys are call them the big
 
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
guys which are droplets that are greater
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
than five microns and the little guys
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
which we call aerosols which are less
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
than five microns in fact they're called
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
respirable particles meaning they reach
 
00:28:10.269 --> 00:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
the Deep lung and that's what causes
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
disease as I'll show in a second
 
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
99% or more of the co particles are
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
aerosols so while it is true that mass
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
can stop droplets to some degree it's
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
it's shining the the laser pointer to
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
the wrong
 
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
place and the real issue and and this
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
has been pointed out in my letter along
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
with six other scientists to CDC as well
 
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
as a letter before that from I think 25
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
scientists saying look you're you're
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
really deceiving the public about this
 
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
Mass Stop droplets because the issue
 
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
isn't droplets it's aerosols the little
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
guys and this is largely not understood
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
by our our Public Health officials as
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
well as people making policy yes sir
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh I'm not aware of cases so I want
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
to ask you mentioned that when we see
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
mold it means increase of like 100 uh so
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
were there actually cases when people
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
were wearing masks to the extent that
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
mold was seen on masks or uh could you
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
expand yeah I mean I've I've testified
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
on how many mold cases and then I dozens
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
of mold cases but I just give it as a
 
00:29:28.509 --> 00:29:28.519 align:start position:0%
point of reference that um when I say
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
amplification I don't mean we're
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
doubling the rate from say mold being
 
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
visible to non-visible it's going up by
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
a factor of 10 to 100 so the problem of
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
course with that is you're going to
 
00:29:40.509 --> 00:29:40.519 align:start position:0%
rebreathe that stuff back in right
 
00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
you've discharged it at say let's call
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
it a level of one and now it's going to
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
come back into your body at a level of
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
10 to 100 well it's it doesn't you don't
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
have to have a degree to realize that
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
that's gonna your immune system is going
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
to react to that and react strongly and
 
00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's gonna
 
00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
weaken it because it's got to fight off
 
00:30:01.159 --> 00:30:01.870 align:start position:0%
weaken it because it's got to fight off
this

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
stuff um and then it makes you more
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
vulnerable obviously to anything else
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:10.430 align:start position:0%
 
along

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
along
 
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for being here um I wanted
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
to ask you about something that I I saw
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
some time ago uh regarding a study that
 
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
sort of popped up and then disappeared
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
so to set the frame obviously I can
 
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
understand why people going into this
 
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
would think that a mask could be
 
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.630 align:start position:0%
would think that a mask could be
effective

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
in general because well it stops you
 
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
know some stuff from coming out but in
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
order to look at all the you know other
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
you know things that could happen there
 
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
was this one study I saw it it suggested
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
that as you were saying this whole
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
amplification effect that happens within
 
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
masks could actually cause a much higher
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
viral load to build up in the mask that
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
then when either forcefully exhaled or
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
coughed into the Mas mask could cause uh
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
huge amounts of Aer isolation of the
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
virus from The Mask to the environment
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
is that something you you've heard of or
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
have any familiarity with I'm aware of
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
of that work that argues that because
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
the mask in terms and we'll talk about
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
the particle sizes coming up here but
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
the mask if you will Envision it as a a
 
00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.029 align:start position:0%
the mask if you will Envision it as a a
big

00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
big
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
screen and so you get these drop what
 
00:31:20.669 --> 00:31:20.679 align:start position:0%
droplets are formed then have to wedge
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
their way through the screen and are
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
broken up and that is true the bigger
 
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
issue though is
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
the uh we'll get to this but the drop
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
they're so small a mass by definition
 
00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:36.039 align:start position:0%
cannot be sealed and I'll talk about
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
that because a mass that can be sealed
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
respirator and there in lies the problem
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
uh so let me continue on the on the
 
00:31:48.629 --> 00:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
sorry can I just ask what what's the
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism that you're proposing for how
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
a virus is going to be Amplified inside
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
a mask they need
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
cells the the mechanism is that when you
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
have um if you look at at conditions
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
where biologics amplify in other words
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
grow whether it be a a virus mold or
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
bacteria um two conditions uh are really
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
important one is the moist that there's
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
moisture present because if it's very
 
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
dry things don't grow viruses don't just
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
amplify on their own they need to be
 
00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
inside cells to grow so you're saying
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
that there's like no no no I'm talking
 
00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
inside the mask that the vir I'm not
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
talking about the virus I'm talking
 
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
about the mold and the bacteria okay but
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Co I understand but
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about the fact that that
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
those things when Amplified weaken the
 
00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:42.919 align:start position:0%
immune system so that when you do get
 
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
exposed to covid a virus you have
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
enhanced rate at which you're going to
 
00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:47.590 align:start position:0%
enhanced rate at which you're going to
get

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
sick okay I'm sorry if I didn't clarify
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
that as much as I should
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
have now let's talk a little bit about
 
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
the micr scale because this is a side
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
that you don't hear about so much you
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
hear a lot of the is back and forth on
 
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
epidemiological studies right that some
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
show it does some say it doesn't I the
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
real studies I think show it that is
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
that they're not effective masking
 
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
anyway so just by way of reference if
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
we've probably all seen this uh
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
especially if you have a day with
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
sunlight in in a room where there's dust
 
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
floating around dancing around and you
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
look up and see it that visible dust and
 
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
sunlight's around on the order of 50
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
microns or larger okay now if you look
 
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
at the covid
 
00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.519 align:start position:0%
particle imagine that this uh white
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
cylinder is the diameter of a human hair
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
cross-section now that red dot isn't the
 
00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
size of Co it's 10 times the size of Co
 
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
so I can show it to you so in terms of
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
diameter the co particle approaches a
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
thousand times
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
smaller the question I ask people
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
constantly is can you get a human hair
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
by the side of your m a mask well on
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
either side of your nose and below your
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
eyes almost all anybody can you can get
 
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
hundreds of hairs past it in fact you
 
00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
see a lot of men wearing facial hair so
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
this is a super freeway around the ma
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
Let's ignore whether the mask is
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
effective or not we'll get to that in a
 
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
second as soon as you have gaps at all
 
00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
they basically the master are
 
00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:29.079 align:start position:0%
ineffective and and and um so that's why
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
it could never have
 
00:34:33.869 --> 00:34:33.879 align:start position:0%
worked now let's talk a little bit about
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
the size of these particles remember I
 
00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
said before the the the big issue and
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
the big lie is that Co is a
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
droplet it's an aerosol primarily it's
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
not that there's not zero droplets it's
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
just as Edward shows and he did this
 
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
study with uh green monkeys primates not
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
humans because you you're not really
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
allowed today to experiment on humans
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
not not you're not supposed to anyway
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
but primates are the next best
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
um uh they're the best animals really to
 
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
study to see whether or not the effects
 
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
will translate to
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
humans and this is a little busy but the
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
bottom line is they you see that the
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
particle sizes as the person as the
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
monkeys were infected go up as you would
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
expect but in terms of
 
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
size over 99% of the particles were
 
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
aerosols or less than five
 
00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:33.079 align:start position:0%
microns so the problem wasn't about
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
droplets the problem was how do we
 
00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.349 align:start position:0%
droplets the problem was how do we
control

00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
aerosols and this has
 
00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
been um as I said this was one of the
 
00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
big statements we made in my letter to
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
CDC and to Dr fouchi in the white house
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
now what does this mean in the real
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
world there's a thing called Stokes law
 
00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
that you can run and um it's basically
 
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
if you have still air and you know the
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
size of a particle and you know its
 
00:35:59.309 --> 00:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
density how fast will it fall what's the
 
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
settling velocity so I said well what's
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
a settling velocity from five how long
 
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
would it take for a particle of
 
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
different sizes to fall five feet which
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
is kind of from somebody's nose
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
down for big droplet particles 10 to 100
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
microns the time to fall is somewhere on
 
00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
the order of of less than a minute to to
 
00:36:19.319 --> 00:36:20.390 align:start position:0%
the order of of less than a minute to to
10

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
minutes um but what happens when the
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
particles get
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
little well now our now our SC isn't
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
basically minutes it's
 
00:36:34.349 --> 00:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
days think about that days so a CO
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
particle is on the order around 0.1
 
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
microns or so we're talking about 40 to
 
00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.550 align:start position:0%
microns or so we're talking about 40 to
50

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
50
 
00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:45.079 align:start position:0%
days so I always said to people when
 
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
they first started putting out the six
 
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
foot uh distance I called those the
 
00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.829 align:start position:0%
foot uh distance I called those the
dummy

00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
dummy
 
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
dots because first of all a particle
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
that going to stay suspended and that's
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
assuming you don't stir up
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
again uh for that long of time it
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
certainly doesn't have a stop sign on
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
saying okay I'm at 6 feet I'm not going
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
any further now the other thing is I
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
spent three years looking for any data
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
supporting the sixf foot rule and could
 
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
never find
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
any now it turns out later on as I'll
 
00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
show that fouchy and others have
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
admitted that it was made up no surprise
 
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
to me because I couldn't find any papers
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
on it for a year and a half and I'm
 
00:37:28.309 --> 00:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
pretty thorough researcher
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
now the other thing that's done with
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
masking and we'll show it in a second
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
this is a busy plot I don't expect you
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
to understand all of it drunck was an
 
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
honest broker he said look we're not
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
going to show you mask Effectiveness by
 
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
almost all the studies glue The Mask to
 
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
a board or a
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
mannequin and I asked people do you glue
 
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
your mask to your face I I don't know
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
anybody does that I I heard of one case
 
00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
it was kind of stupid but he actually
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
looked at what happens if there's gaps
 
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
in The Mask how how does it decrease the
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
mask and what this plot shows is that
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
for surgical
 
00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:09.079 align:start position:0%
masks that if what he did is he looked
 
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
at well what if you had say 100 square
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
centimeters of a mask and you assumed 1%
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
of it 1 centimeter was was a gap 1% Gap
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
how does that drop the effectivess of
 
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
the mask and then he looked at 2% Etc
 
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
and at 2% and the in the correlation is
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
pretty linear the mass dropped in its
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness by
 
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
80% well I said well that's interesting
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
why don't I just project that line out
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
to where it's
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
0% well it's 3% of mask area
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
open the mask has zero
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness now I actually took my
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
Spirit Airlines mask and measured the
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
gaps on my own face
 
00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
9%

00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
9%
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
so they had no chance now there was some
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier about viruses
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
bacteria Etc this is a a chart and the
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
reason I show it is you'll see on the
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
bottom is dated 1992 I'm a member of
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
what they call ashray American Society
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
of heating Refrigeration air
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
conditioning Engineers I've been a
 
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
member of that for 40 years and in fact
 
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
I'm on the committee right now updating
 
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.069 align:start position:0%
I'm on the committee right now updating
this

00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:21.589 align:start position:0%
this
table

00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
um and viruses turned out to be a really
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
really small particle relative to even
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
bacteria and and mold spores I mean they
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
their bacteria are probably 10 to 20
 
00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.349 align:start position:0%
their bacteria are probably 10 to 20
times

00:39:34.349 --> 00:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
bigger so we're dealing with very very
 
00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.109 align:start position:0%
bigger so we're dealing with very very
small

00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
particles so what does all this mean it
 
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
means that the little that the issue has
 
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
always been about I call them the little
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
guys the aerosols not the big guys the
 
00:39:50.109 --> 00:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
droplets the vast majority of the
 
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
particles are the little guys the little
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
guys stay in the air for hours to days
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
and they reach deep into the lung and
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
are associated with disease
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
so the real information was that CDC
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
said Mass Stop droplets may be true to
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
some degree but the problem isn't
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
aerosols so the other question I got
 
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
asked in in Trials about this and in
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
public forums is well you know Mr Petty
 
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
aren't you saying that are you saying
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
these will do no good that's the classic
 
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
lawyer question
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
right and I said well first of all it's
 
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
not standard of care our standard of
 
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
care as industrial hygienist is that the
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
um whatever solution we propose should
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
reduce the risk by at least 90% why do I
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
say that let's imagine that I propose a
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
solution that that uh stops asbestos
 
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
workers 1% of them from getting
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
asbestosis and the other 99% get it and
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
die well I should lose all my
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
credentials if I did that that's not
 
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839 align:start position:0%
really looking out for the public health
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
safety is
 
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
it so and the other Parable I give all
 
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
the time is let's imagine you have an
 
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
engineer and a mathematician in a
 
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
room and the moderator says okay look at
 
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
that far wall and move halfway to it and
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
then move halfway again and move halfway
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
forever and then he asked each of them
 
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
the question did you get to the
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
wall mathematician says no the engineer
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
says yep close enough
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
so when somebody asks me are masks 0%
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
effective I say probably not but they're
 
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.109 align:start position:0%
effective I say probably not but they're
darn

00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
darn
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
close and moreover our standard of care
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
is that we need to protect the vast
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
majority of people with our Solutions
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
not a minority not a small
 
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
minority and the bigger problem with
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
masks is they do they they they convince
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
people they're doing some good but then
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
they um don't go and take on the real
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
solutions so here's here's a plot here's
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
a picture of uh CD CDC has this on their
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
website of the STM face covering
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
standard that's how they test face masks
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
they glue them onto a
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
board now even with an n95 they'll say
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay if it's glued on the board it's 46%
 
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
effective we'll argue whether that's
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
true or not as soon as they put a gap on
 
00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.109 align:start position:0%
true or not as soon as they put a gap on
it

00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:28.510 align:start position:0%
 
3.4%

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
3.4%
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
surgical Mass cloth Mass from from this
 
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
work uh around 10% or less that's not a
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
solution for us it just isn't and the
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
reason I say that is we got away with it
 
00:42:45.069 --> 00:42:45.079 align:start position:0%
with covid because The lethality rate
 
00:42:47.069 --> 00:42:47.079 align:start position:0%
was so low on the order of
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
.2% mainly with elderly over
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
65 if if anybody recalls when Ebola hit
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
and we had some PE some people um
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
workers in Africa coming back remember
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
the PPE that was being worn by the the
 
00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
people working with those people it was
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
level a moon we call Moon
 
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
Suits now if Co had had a 50%
 
00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
lethality people would have been
 
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
throwing these masks away in two seconds
 
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
because half their friends would be dead
 
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
so the problem we had was that nobody
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
really knew whether they were working or
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
not because The lethality was so
 
00:43:26.119 --> 00:43:29.390 align:start position:0%
not because The lethality was so
low

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
so you know I was saying this back in
 
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
2020 I've helped hundreds of people I
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
don't know why because it was taking me
 
00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:39.559 align:start position:0%
two to six hours a day along with my
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
full-time job but I would go anywhere
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
and help anyone that I could because I
 
00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
felt so strongly that the public was
 
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
being misled on real
 
00:43:50.349 --> 00:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
solutions so it's just not Steve Petty
 
00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:52.559 align:start position:0%
saying this we have Scott G godle who's
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
now with fiser but he was former FDA
 
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner and he says this on CBS
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
faal Nation
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
um in early 202020 2022 pardon me cloth
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
masks aren't going to provide a lot of
 
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
protection that's the bottom line This
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
is an Airborne illness we understand
 
00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
that a cloth mask is not going to
 
00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
protect you from a
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
virus not a surprise to me but we
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
finally got some
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
truth more recently uh Dr jaaw out of
 
00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
the White House the co uh director ctor
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
said um there's no study in the world
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
that show Mass work now I I don't know
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
that I would agree with them I think
 
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
there's been plenty of very questionable
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
studies that suggest that they do but no
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
reasonable study does this isn't a
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
surprise by the way
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
um uh there was a gentleman Dr Kellogg
 
00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
who ran the California health system
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
during the Spanish Flu pandemic in
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
1918 and he had advocated masking and on
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
page 26 of his report in 1919 kind of on
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
Lessons Learned he shows a plot of uh I
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
believe it it's a city in Massachusetts
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
where masking wasn't worn versus a city
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
in California they
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
were basically no difference in death
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
rates and he says you know the masking
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't work for the public now he still
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
what confuses some people is he still
 
00:45:21.549 --> 00:45:21.559 align:start position:0%
was not against masking and hospitals
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
but that was for the big
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
droplets a different argument you always
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
got to remember that because is the
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
people that advocate for Mas will say
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
well see the people in the hospitals we
 
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
them it's a very powerful argument but
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
it's for big body fluids the study after
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
study and I can cite them for you
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
say whether a physician when a physician
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
wears a mask it doesn't lower his rate
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
of getting or transmitting infectious
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
diseases nor does it for the patient
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
this is to stop big droplets either from
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
the doctor or from the patient like big
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
Globs of blood spum Etc it has nothing
 
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
diseases and most recently uh there's
 
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.710 align:start position:0%
diseases and most recently uh there's
been

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
um some work being done on whether
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
masking should be done in hospitals and
 
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
cdc's Eric Stone this is very recent
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
just said basically mask don't work now
 
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
CDC wasn't happy with him about it
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
but that's what he
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
said and then
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
um you know CDC is funny saying this now
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
I wanted to show you this is the actual
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
data from 1919 the plot of uh a city
 
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
where Mass were warn in terms of death
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
rates in the city where they
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
weren't so I say to people I'm not some
 
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
Noel laate this information has been
 
00:46:46.829 --> 00:46:46.839 align:start position:0%
known for a long time over a hundred
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
years and um people just needed to be
 
00:46:51.549 --> 00:46:51.559 align:start position:0%
made aware of
 
00:46:54.549 --> 00:46:54.559 align:start position:0%
it so a couple of things I've run into
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
in in court cases is uh Public Health
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
officials will say well I'm just
 
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
following CDC
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
guidance which I think is a copout
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
frankly because I said to them well
 
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
which guidance are you
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
following the guidance in early 2020
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
that mass aren't needed later in 2020
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
that they dar needed later in 2021 that
 
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
they aren't needed and then now again
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
well they're really not so good let's go
 
00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:21.990 align:start position:0%
well they're really not so good let's go
to

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
n95s so I say to people what science
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
changes its position on a topic 180°
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
Mass no Mass two times in two
 
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
years there is no science that does
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
that not that I'm aware
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
of if you want to look at uh what really
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
would work in terms of PPE and I'm not
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
advocating PPE by the way and you look
 
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
at the Criterion in uh the respiratory
 
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
protection standard OSHA 29 cfr1
 
00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
1910.134 and I've testified on this over
 
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.150 align:start position:0%
1910.134 and I've testified on this over
300

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
300
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
times on this standard
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
um you'll find that the criteria for
 
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
wearing a respirator are listed here and
 
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
almost none of those criteria apply to a
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
mask I'm not going to bore you with all
 
00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.109 align:start position:0%
mask I'm not going to bore you with all
the

00:48:10.109 --> 00:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
details so what caused me to write the
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
letter to
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
CDC how long I guess I was the primary
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
author what happened in early 2022 or so
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
was that CD saidwell you know those
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
maths aren't so great so let's move to
 
00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:27.510 align:start position:0%
maths aren't so great so let's move to
n95s

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
n95s
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
well first of all as a as an exposure
 
00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
exert n95s are the bottom of the barrel
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
respirators but they were advocating
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
that that the respirators n95s could be
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
used by children well I knew right away
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
that was fallacious because no
 
00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:47.079 align:start position:0%
respirator has ever been approved by
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
nios for used by children
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
ever so what did CDC they they they say
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
well if you want to know more about this
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
go over there and link to 3 website or
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
mold X's website and get more
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
information so I did I'm probably one of
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
the few that did what did it say what
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
did 3M say about masks or
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
n95s not designed to be used by children
 
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
so you got CDC paragraph advocating n95s
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
for children go to this link to see more
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
what does the manufacturers say not for
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
children you can't make this stuff
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
up and they said only designed for
 
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
adults and occupational settings and
 
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
trained I.E respiratory protection
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
standard and that adults must be
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
medically cleared to wear an n95
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
respirator in other words we got to make
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
sure they don't have some underlying
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
like we always do for respirators they
 
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
don't have some underlying health
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
condition that would hurt them if they
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
had their breathing somewhat restricted
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
by a respirator yes ma'am uh yes Mr py
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um when it says here that they
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
need to be trained to wear those masks
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
could you just explain to me why you
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
would need to be
 
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
trained yeah there's
 
00:50:03.789 --> 00:50:03.799 align:start position:0%
um by training it's really broader than
 
00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:05.799 align:start position:0%
that you need somebody usually an
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
industrial hygienist but somebody with
 
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
my expertise or or like that when you're
 
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
going to put uh what the um what the
 
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
respiratory protection standard says is
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
first of all you got to do a hazards
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
analysis what does that mean that means
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
you have to figure out what is the
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
contaminant that you're concerned about
 
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
and what is its concentration because
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
until you know that you don't know what
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
to provide them with protective
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
equipment so that sets the stage for
 
00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:33.799 align:start position:0%
what will work now I'm here to tell you
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
mask and n95s won't be picked why
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
because n95s are prohibited for use by
 
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
asbest workers by law in California for
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
example asbestos particles are 50 times
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
greater than Co particles so why in the
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
heck would we ever promote masks or n95s
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
for particles that are much smaller than
 
00:50:58.349 --> 00:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
particles where they're prohibited
 
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
now the other part of that is um once
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
you decide you that you've picked the
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
right PPE say a mask or a respirator I
 
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.030 align:start position:0%
right PPE say a mask or a respirator I
should

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
say you have to have that selected and
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
fit tested for the individual in other
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
words um for instance the the two major
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
providers of respirators are north and
 
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
3M I can never get a 3M to seal on my
 
00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
face it just doesn't seal I have to wear
 
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
a north and I have to wear a large
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
somebody else might have to wear a
 
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
medium or somebody have to wear a small
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
so you have to have all those available
 
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
and you have to try them out on people
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
and make sure that they do
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
seal so you got to pick the right
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
equipment you got to make sure it works
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
and then you have to train the
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
individual on how to store it how to
 
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
clean it how to often to change the
 
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.789 align:start position:0%
clean it how to often to change the
cartridges

00:51:47.789 --> 00:51:47.799 align:start position:0%
cartridges
 
00:51:47.799 --> 00:51:51.109 align:start position:0%
cartridges
Etc

00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I this is really good
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
information um that I want to dig a
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
little bit into
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
I was injured uh badly in an industrial
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
accident a smoke inhalation injury
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
before which I had respirator quals but
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
after which I had my respirator quals um
 
00:52:10.589 --> 00:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
pulled because of a lung condition that
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
I developed that prohibits me from being
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
able to wear a respirator so I just
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to get down into that a little
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
bit to suggest that there is at least
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
hypothetically um caused to believe you
 
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
could you could do harm by requiring
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
Hing people who were not medically able
 
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
to um wear masks and respirators yes
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's correct before as an industral
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
hygienist the first thing I have to
 
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
check on for the worker is have they
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
been medically cleared to wear a
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
respirator if they haven't then I can't
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
it's my job to prevent them from any
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
going any further in the process they
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
have to be excluded and in fact I've
 
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
testified in many cases where a
 
00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
physician um said no this person's got
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
whether it be smoking or some chronic
 
00:52:59.599 --> 00:53:00.910 align:start position:0%
whether it be smoking or some chronic
lung

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
lung
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
disease they they don't pass what they
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
call the F tests on lung capacity or
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
lung function and so they can't wear
 
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
respirator and then you've had the
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
company's industrial hygienist approve
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
them for use of the respirator now
 
00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:17.799 align:start position:0%
that's that'll get you in
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
help thank you so much for being here um
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
I just had a question concerning time
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
frame wise uh I have a very good friend
 
00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:35.240 align:start position:0%
that does um that does cleanup work with
 
00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
asbestos and mold and all of that kind
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
of stuff and has um you know his
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
employees and how long because it's only
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of time that you can
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
wear them for correct like it's not you
 
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
can't wear them for very long periods of
 
00:53:50.109 --> 00:53:50.119 align:start position:0%
time right before you have to take a
 
00:53:53.789 --> 00:53:53.799 align:start position:0%
break no that's not true okay um but I
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
will say a couple of things in my
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
opinion personal protective equipment
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
should only be used for we'll get into
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
this in a second it's on the Bottom Rung
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
of ways we want to protect people it's
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
in my view it's really a temporary
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
emergency sort of situation where you
 
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
want to wear it and the reason for that
 
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
is we've known for decades that wearing
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
say a respirator or any PPE is
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and uncomfortable
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
particularly in hot or cold settings and
 
00:54:23.549 --> 00:54:23.559 align:start position:0%
people will break the seals they won't
 
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
wear it properly um and so it's not
 
00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:27.589 align:start position:0%
wear it properly um and so it's not
effective

00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:54:31.789 --> 00:54:31.799 align:start position:0%
so the any I've done it but most people
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
haven't try to wear I know I used to
 
00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
have to go up where there was a lot of
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
bird dooo Etc and addicts and I would I
 
00:54:40.589 --> 00:54:40.599 align:start position:0%
was always more worried about bacteria
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
than than mold but I would wear a
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
respirator and it'd be 110 degrees in
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
that attic you try to wear a respirator
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
for more than 15 or 20 minutes and
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
you're you can be in tremendous shape
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
and it's very
 
00:54:59.309 --> 00:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
difficult yes so there is no
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
specific limitation on how long you can
 
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
wear it but there's a reality that uh if
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
you try to put people in respirators
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
that have eight hour shifts say day
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
after day after
 
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
day you're dishonest if you think you're
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
actually protecting them yeah that's why
 
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
he gives his workers breaks and things
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
like that and I'm familiar I was um in
 
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
the military in the Army and one of my
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
jobs was NBC uh so so I was um 94 Bravo
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
decontamination unit so I've spent a lot
 
00:55:37.029 --> 00:55:37.039 align:start position:0%
of time in my gas mask and um so it was
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
horrible I always told people early on I
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
said let's remember when when people
 
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
were having to wear masks you go to a
 
00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:43.799 align:start position:0%
restaurant and they'd make you put the
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
mask on and then you sit down and then
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
you take it off and you eat and drink or
 
00:55:49.789 --> 00:55:49.799 align:start position:0%
whatever and I'm like so I said let's
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
imagine that this mask is perfect and
 
00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
that room's full of nerve agent because
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
I worked a nerve agent in my previous
 
00:55:59.309 --> 00:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
career at Patel and I said and it will
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
kill you pretty quickly yep I said so
 
00:56:05.789 --> 00:56:05.799 align:start position:0%
you got I'm not saying this is true but
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
your PP your mask is perfect it's been
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
helping you there and then you take it
 
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
off to
 
00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:14.850 align:start position:0%
eat with a lethal material
 
00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:16.430 align:start position:0%
eat with a lethal material
[Music]

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
present how does that make any
 
00:56:23.029 --> 00:56:23.039 align:start position:0%
sense I mean this is just defies common
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
sense so you had to know at that point
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
in time it was
 
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
effective all righty
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
enough so um what else does the warnings
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
this is from the 3M label on
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
n95s you can go look it up failure to
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
follow instructions may result in
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
sickness or
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
death must follow the respiratory
 
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
protection standard we've talked about
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
that must be able to be sealed or do not
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
use a mask cannot be sealed by
 
00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
definition in fact the face covering
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
standard uh
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
bym says in it
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
explicitly face coverings isn't a fancy
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
word for Mass are not
 
00:57:11.789 --> 00:57:11.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
protective remember I I I want stuff to
 
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
be protective now social distancing this
 
00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
drove me crazy for
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
years and I would remind CDC all the
 
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
time they had no basis for this 6 foot
 
00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.549 align:start position:0%
time they had no basis for this 6 foot
rule

00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
so finally they cited a study in 2020
 
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:31.710 align:start position:0%
so finally they cited a study in 2020
late

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
late
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
2021 this is it and fascinatingly that
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
you won't be able to see all the detail
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
here but it was a it was a study in
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
China all the units are in metric none
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
of them convert to six
 
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
feet and more importantly on this if you
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
look at where the person that got sick
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
was um there were people that got sicker
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
even close to the supply of fresh
 
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
air so I pointed that out that first of
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
all there it was all in metric there was
 
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
nothing the St had nothing to do with
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
six feet it had to do with people
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
getting sick in a
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant and um so you know they left
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
that up for like a year and then then we
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
had our Infamous friend Scott gotle who
 
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
said uh well about the 20 the 6ot rule
 
00:58:27.069 --> 00:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
he says nobody know knows where it came
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
from I
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
said yeah no
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
kidding and then uh Dr fouchy very
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
recently January
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
24 yeah we it lacks scientific evidence
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's pretty scary honestly that we had
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
people in lines fighting each other
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
because they were closer than six feet
 
00:58:50.829 --> 00:58:50.839 align:start position:0%
and weren't standing on the
 
00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
dots I mean how sad is that yeah than
 
00:58:57.069 --> 00:58:57.079 align:start position:0%
thank you and that's a that's a good
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
point I just read a little further in
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
that and he mentions that there is an
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
assumption among them that it may have
 
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
come from something old regarding the
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
flu where maybe the flu doesn't travel
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
six feet so I I my question is and I
 
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:10.839 align:start position:0%
don't know if you you have this
 
00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
information but is there reason to
 
00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
believe based on our previous knowledge
 
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
of Corona viruses versus our knowledge
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
of the flu that Corona virus is going to
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
behave in that same way as the flu
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
regarding transmission aerosolization
 
00:59:28.829 --> 00:59:28.839 align:start position:0%
the time it see suspended and
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
whatnot uh you asked multiple questions
 
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
so I'll try to answer both of them with
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
respect to the issue the last one First
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
Co and the flu from standpoint of
 
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
particles and transmission essentially
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
the same now when I was looking up for
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
any studies on any distancing I found
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
one study from the 30s and it had a
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
three-foot rule and it was based on
 
00:59:51.309 --> 00:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis and on
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
droplets so it was a different disease
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
it was a bacteria much bigger part
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
articles and it was based on a different
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
distance but CDC and the rest of the the
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
scientific Community never cited that
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
work in
 
01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.710 align:start position:0%
work in
fact

01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
um there
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
was there was some information
 
01:00:16.589 --> 01:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
suggesting that past studies had looked
 
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
at distancing but then they never really
 
01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
talk about that particular study and
 
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
what it what it applied to but to my
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
know there's never been any um support
 
01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:31.960 align:start position:0%
for that and when you look at the the
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
basic size of particle suspension time
 
01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:35.559 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
air there's just no I say to people
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
let's imagine that that you're in a
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
store and somebody's really sick with
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
covid two days
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
earlier or even a day earlier and that
 
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
stuff can be suspended for weeks right
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
and then if you Stir It Up it's it's
 
01:00:56.109 --> 01:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
longer than that because I'm talking
 
01:00:59.789 --> 01:00:59.799 align:start position:0%
about still air and you walk in a day
 
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
later there's no way in the world you
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
have a covid meter on your chest telling
 
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
you oops there's a plume of
 
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
covid that was there's never going to be
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
a solution for that situation the only
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
solution as we'll get to was either
 
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
dilute it
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
out filter it out or destroy
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
it it's been the solution since 1950
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
it'll be the solution as far in the
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
future as I
 
01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.990 align:start position:0%
future as I
know

01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
now let me talk a little in the world of
 
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
industrial hygiene we live with this
 
01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:34.119 align:start position:0%
chart it's called the hierarchy of
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
controls it's how we deal with almost
 
01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:39.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of like our little bible
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's how we deal with exposure to
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
hazards of any kind falling tripping
 
01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.349 align:start position:0%
hazards of any kind falling tripping
infectious

01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
infectious
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
diseases and the things that are the
 
01:01:51.309 --> 01:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
most important are on the top and
 
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
effective and the things that are least
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
effective are on the
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
bottom the least effective is PPE of
 
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
course masks don't even fit in there
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
because they can't be sealed they're not
 
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
PPE um and we should we would know that
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
right away this by the way was brought
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
to us by the national Safety Council in
 
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
1950 um so we already talked about PPE I
 
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
won't belabor that administrative
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
controls is a fancy way of saying let's
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
just keep you out of the bad area so
 
01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:21.799 align:start position:0%
you're not there very long or at all
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
well if you're dealing with an
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
infectious disease it's kind of hard to
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
do that because you got the public right
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
so how you going to keep people out of
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
spaces and we do that with a bowl and
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
really toxic thing you know really
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
lethal things you know we very carefully
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
isolate those folks now the other the
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
next level up is engineering controls
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
I've already talked about that
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
dilute um filter
 
01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
destroy the the best of all worlds would
 
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
be to either eliminate or substitute it
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't really apply to co it's
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
not like like I just I was finishing a
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
project on silic Co is yesterday for all
 
01:02:59.069 --> 01:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
these workers are using artificial stone
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
and they're cutting it and they were
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
just say an epidemic of
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
silicosis and the obvious solution was
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
Silica use engineering you know use
 
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
artificial stone but don't use Silica
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
we've known for almost a hundred years
 
01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:18.039 align:start position:0%
that this is preventable and we
 
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing that um and what did
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
I site in there hierarchy of controls so
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
this is a very I don't want to say simp
 
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
like I'm trying to demean people but
 
01:03:30.029 --> 01:03:30.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very
 
01:03:32.269 --> 01:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
straightforward way to think about how
 
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
to solve
 
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
problems and that's what we
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
use now cdc's approach of course in
 
01:03:46.349 --> 01:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
2021 was the solution is masks and then
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
the solution beginning in 2022 was well
 
01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
masks or not
 
01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
n95s um but my solution has been since
 
01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.190 align:start position:0%
n95s um but my solution has been since
2020

01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
2020
 
01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.069 align:start position:0%
2020
engineering

01:03:59.069 --> 01:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
engineering
 
01:04:02.349 --> 01:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
controls and why I'm not a rocket
 
01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
scientist it's been around long before I
 
01:04:04.119 --> 01:04:05.349 align:start position:0%
scientist it's been around long before I
was

01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.119 --> 01:04:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
children

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.109 --> 01:04:16.119 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to read through these
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
and and be a you know but they're all
 
01:04:22.269 --> 01:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
here the um first of all this is the
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
study that shows of course that if you
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
wear masks you're going to increase the
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
rated disease so this applies not only
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
to children but to everyone but when you
 
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
um child harms there are study after
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
study after study showing all sorts of
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
negative implications to children in
 
01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.829 align:start position:0%
negative implications to children in
learning

01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
learning
 
01:04:41.839 --> 01:04:43.510 align:start position:0%
learning
psychologically

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
psychologically
 
01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.029 align:start position:0%
psychologically
emotionally

01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
emotionally
 
01:04:47.269 --> 01:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
learning I'm not going to go through all
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
those but even the even the who does not
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
allow masking for children below 11
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
without a cost benefit
 
01:05:00.269 --> 01:05:00.279 align:start position:0%
analysis and there's no it's never been
 
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
run CDC has never run a cost benefit
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
analysis on masking versus not masking
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
in fact they require masking down to
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
age2 which is almost criminal in my view
 
01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:11.799 align:start position:0%
because that's the Early Learning period
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
we know now on real work children ages 0
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
to two have had a 25% reduction in
 
01:05:19.119 --> 01:05:20.150 align:start position:0%
to two have had a 25% reduction in
learning

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
learning
 
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
rates how fast they can say words Etc in
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
fact what's really disturbing is in
 
01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:27.950 align:start position:0%
fact what's really disturbing is in
early

01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
early
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
2022 CDC announced that they were uh
 
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
revising the Child Development criteria
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
that had been in place for 15 years and
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
what were they revising them to in about
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
40% of the cases they were moving the
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
gohost forward right so if you were
 
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be able to say so many words
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
at 24 months now they moved them to 30
 
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
months I said this is this wasn't
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
revising this was this was covering up
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that you knew these were
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
harming children in their development
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
and rather than addressing the issue you
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
simply changed the criteria by which
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
when children had to know certain things
 
01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.109 align:start position:0%
when children had to know certain things
on

01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:10.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
unconscionable um so I'm not going to
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
belabor uh all the you can go on and on
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
and on about these studies this one by
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum Associates what's fascinating
 
01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
is it looked at um loss of learning
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
learning uh grades 1 through 8 on
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
reading up to 12% reduction in learning
 
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
rates math up to
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
15% sadly for minorities the impact was
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
worse um and then we have a study here
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
I'm flipping through these quickly Brown
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
University for young people as I just
 
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned the learning composite score
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
dropped 23% around a quarter of a loss
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.119 --> 01:07:01.069 align:start position:0%
 
study

01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
um both on non-verbal and
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
verbal England you know this wasn't just
 
01:07:09.269 --> 01:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
in the United States we work out of
 
01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
England says the same thing that the
 
01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
teachers are saying
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
94% of them thought that wearing face
 
01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
coverings has made it difficult for
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
children to
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
learn some over half said much more
 
01:07:29.549 --> 01:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
difficult um there was a study by kizli
 
01:07:33.309 --> 01:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
off uh or kizony I'm sorry looked at
 
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
1,26 papers uh related to impacts of
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
negative impacts of or impacts period of
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
of people wearing masks face coverings
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
they distilled it down to 109 papers
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
that had qualitative analysis and 44
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
that had quantitative analysis that they
 
01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
felt were
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable you can see the URL on the
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
bottom if you want to go chase it down
 
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
yourself and they they discovered
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
27 Quantified adverse effects five
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
specific associated with
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
children impacts on respiratory U
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
diseases including asthma
 
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
cardiopulmonary neuromuscular and
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
epilepsy uh not not a surprise uh
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
basically when you affect um breathing
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
you affect all all the tissues from the
 
01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
nose all the way to the Deep lung in
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
terms of negative impacts um Mr Petty
 
01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
yeah if you don't mind I just have a
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
quick question for you would you say
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
that the uh um I don't know if you've
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
done any studies on this uh if special
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
needs have
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
risen uh because of this and uh children
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
with disabilities um has this really
 
01:08:56.110 --> 01:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
adversely affected them you spoke about
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
a school that um with with disabilities
 
01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
that they didn't wear masks and
 
01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
everything seemed to be fine has there
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
been any studies to uh talk about the
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
schools that didn't with the PE the
 
01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
students with
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities I haven't done that
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
personally but Dr Morrison whom I'm in
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
close contact with at this school and
 
01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
she's spoken
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
publicly follows that because she has a
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
very unique program for treating
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
autistic children she her PhD know issue
 
01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
at on treating it you know trying to
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
develop autistic children she's got a
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
very unique school for that and she has
 
01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
commented to me over and over again that
 
01:09:41.789 --> 01:09:41.799 align:start position:0%
the special needs students have been
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
more dramatically impacted in her
 
01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge because she gets students all
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
the time coming from the public schools
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
that want to come to her school and
 
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
they've had real deficits that they've
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
had to try to overcome so it's it's
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
anodot to some degree but I haven't done
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
an independent study but I've talked to
 
01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
somebody who's that is her work thank
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
you very much representative I I have
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
two questions if I may so first about
 
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
masks I'm aware about like one facility
 
01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire kind of daycare that
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
was not pushing Universal masks on kids
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
but uh Educators were wearing masks so
 
01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
can you give any distinction because um
 
01:10:27.149 --> 01:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
it would wouldn't be probably medically
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
harmful for kids if educator wears masks
 
01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
but it might delay the education because
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
they don't see facial impression and the
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
pronunciation yeah yeah the real the
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
loss of learning has more to do with the
 
01:10:44.189 --> 01:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
teachers wearing the masks than
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily the students because they're
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
they're reading facial
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
expressions so that you're you're
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
correct that that is that's one of the
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
primary reasons there's a deficit in
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
learning and my second question is more
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
like uh stepping back uh to the
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
beginning of your
 
01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
presentation uh I just wonder
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
like uh if if you have certain dates
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
when um when the science appeared that
 
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
co uh is uh primarily spread uh VI
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
aerosols versus other and when when for
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
example well CDC
 
01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledged it that Co is spread via
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
aerosols because in the beginning if you
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
remember there was like is it spread via
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
droplets many people thought it could
 
01:11:42.629 --> 01:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
spread via touch so we were wearing some
 
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
recommending wearing plastic
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
gloves ear on everybody was yeah there
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
was the hygiene of you know touching
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
things and touching Packages Etc yeah
 
01:11:53.629 --> 01:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
that was always kind of silly in my view
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
I mean not I'm not saying that
 
01:11:59.709 --> 01:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
you couldn't get um Co that way but that
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't the primary way you're going to
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
co the primary way was going to be
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
through inhalation not through
 
01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
dermal um but as far as time frame
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
goes um to my knowledge CDC has yet to I
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
keep all their web pages because they
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
take them down and replace them all the
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
time but I always save them I guess you
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
can go back and get them but I save them
 
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
anyway to my knowledge they still
 
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
haven't fully acknowledged this is
 
01:12:28.629 --> 01:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
primar a dis primarily a disease of
 
01:12:28.639 --> 01:12:30.350 align:start position:0%
primar a dis primarily a disease of
aerosols

01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
aerosols
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
um they know this
 
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
because this they've
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
gotten multiple letters including the
 
01:12:40.629 --> 01:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
one that's here from
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
me as well as six other scientists um
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
reminding them of that as well as there
 
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
was a letter that went out from 15 or 20
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
other epidemiologists a year before me
 
01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:55.719 align:start position:0%
saying the same thing but more
 
01:12:59.669 --> 01:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
importantly the science on um particle
 
01:12:59.679 --> 01:13:00.950 align:start position:0%
importantly the science on um particle
sizes

01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
sizes
 
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
for um say
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
flu which is a virus have always been
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
about the aerosols that
 
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
because your body has the the reason
 
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
that the science goes way back on
 
01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
particles are always split between I
 
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
just wrote a a paper on this
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday if you will they can be
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
divided I call them the little guys and
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
the big guys but the little guys are
 
01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
always called respirable to be breathed
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
in and the the big guys are called
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
non-resp and the split is five microns
 
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
or about and so what does that really
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
mean and this goes way back I mean this
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
is basic science what that means is that
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
when you get to a respirable size um
 
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
that's why you see like diesel exhaust
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
particles they're talking about 2.5
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
microns the ones that are small
 
01:13:53.709 --> 01:13:53.719 align:start position:0%
right those get deep into the lung and
 
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
it's well understood in other words your
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
body has capacity from the nose to the
 
01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
early stretches of the lung they have
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
vilia and other and and and mucus Etc to
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
trap and stop larger particles from
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
getting into your deep lung the problem
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
is when they get small enough that they
 
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
bypass those natural mechanisms and they
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
reach the Deep lung and that's why
 
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see I've cited some but there's
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
paper after paper going way back that
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
will say the small guys are the problem
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
because they're associated with disease
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
and they bypass Natural Body mechanisms
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
and they reach deep into the
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
lung so why why that's uh why we've had
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
you know the main purpose of my letter
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
here to CDC and I conclude by saying
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
you're damaging and destroying science
 
01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
by doing this stuff the public isn't
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
going to trust you that's not a good
 
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
thing and we're here to help if you
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
would like that's we close the letter
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
saying look we're here to help now
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate I've always
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
worked on on the toxic Tor Arena
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
so um it's not like I've not been on
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
that side of the table trying to help
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
people um I'm not some crazy guy trying
 
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
to tell them their nuts I'm just saying
 
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
look you're really doing
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
harm to the to your position publicly as
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
a trusted Health
 
01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
Organization and it's because you're
 
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
issues and that's that's and and I
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
pointed some of those out already um
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
even our Trade Organization the American
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
industrial hygiene Association
 
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
they very recently in
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
2023 cdc's decided they were going to
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
come out with some advice on how to
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
especially in medical
 
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
facilities um and that's one of our
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
biggest Problems by the way is that
 
01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
people trust the white coats they trust
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
their doctors and they see the doctors
 
01:15:57.239 --> 01:15:58.189 align:start position:0%
their doctors and they see the doctors
wearing

01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
wearing
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
masks the B doctors are wearing masks
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
for these large droplets they're not
 
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
wearing them for covid and the problem
 
01:16:10.629 --> 01:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
is it reinforces the message the wrong
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
message that mass
 
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
work but they're intended for different
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
purposes so anyway the CDC decided they
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
were going to continue to press this by
 
01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
forcing masking and social distancing
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
and medical facilities for people
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
and I testified against it um and our
 
01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.149 align:start position:0%
and I testified against it um and our
Trade

01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
Trade
 
01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
Organization uh came out publicly
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
against it and yesterday I read an
 
01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
article that said that CDC was going to
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
delay implementing this so I'm hopeful
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
that they'll not Implement bad
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
science I I've kept telling them you
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
know the real answer is engineering
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
controls you know that and in fact
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
you'll see the language if you Pro if
 
01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
you read their guidance from 2020 late
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
20 or 20 yeah 20 forward you'll start to
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
see them slowly add language related
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
engineering control it's kind of an
 
01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
afterthought and you also see like on
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
page the first page they always say we
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
recommend masks or something to that
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
effect um interestingly they don't
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
require it now recommended is a
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
different word
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
legally but when you go like on page six
 
01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
of these documents they'll admit masks
 
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
are not personal protective equipment
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
but they know most people aren't going
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
documents Al righty see if I can get
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
this thing to move so the real solutions
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
I think you want you know nobody likes a
 
01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
critic that doesn't have real solutions
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
so I want to talk about those for a
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
second as I've said before the real
 
01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
solutions a straightforward fil add more
 
01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:55.290 align:start position:0%
fresh air filter or destroy it
 
01:17:55.290 --> 01:17:57.070 align:start position:0%
fresh air filter or destroy it
[Music]

01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
um dilution ventilation has been around
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
forever people ask me early on when they
 
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
were afraid what can we do at
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
home I said well honestly I said open
 
01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
windows I said if you open Windows
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
partly I know it be a little colder a
 
01:18:15.629 --> 01:18:15.639 align:start position:0%
little hotter but I said you'll dilute
 
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
the concentration inside your house by
 
01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
10 so you know now what can you do in
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
commercial buildings it turns out
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
because of our energy codes I won't go
 
01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
into all the details I've been involved
 
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
with that for 40 years we have
 
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
increasingly tightened
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
buildings with very little fresh air uh
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of recirculated air because we
 
01:18:39.390 --> 01:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
want to minimize if you bring in fresh
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
air it's got to be treated and it jacks
 
01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
up your uh cost for air conditioning or
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
Heating and so we're looking at
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
buildings that often times have only
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
five 5% Fresh Air Makeup so you're
 
01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
basically just spinning the air in a big
 
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
circle and the contaminants are building
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
up right that's
 
01:19:04.590 --> 01:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
why people get sick more indoors than
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
Outdoors because contaminants tend to
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
build up indoors by a factor of two to
 
01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
four over what they would be
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
outdoors um that's why when we had
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
unnamed officials in New York City
 
01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
saying stay in your multifam building
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
and don't go to the beach or to the
 
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
parks I about pull my hair out man the
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
most safe place in the world is to be
 
01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
near a beach where you've got salt
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
aerosols and heavy dilution of any
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
contaminants I mean the last thing you
 
01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
want is everybody ganged up together um
 
01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
Mr Petty um glad you brought that up
 
01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
that was a topic of uh con discussion
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
here because one of the things that New
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did was we shut down the
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
beaches um because we thought that there
 
01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
would be too many people in one spot um
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
I know I can see your smiling um I'm
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
sorry I just understand the sanity of
 
01:20:00.669 --> 01:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
that from my perspective is so could you
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
explain because you know I mean we went
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
into the social distancing aspect of
 
01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
that already but you said that Salt
 
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
Air is that a benefit and does that help
 
01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
dissipate things could you yeah I mean
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
the salt there's always salt aerosols
 
01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
around especially around the oceans
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
right and salt is a is a desicant and it
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
tends to to destroy
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
bacteria and viruses because it extracts
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
their liquids but more importantly you
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
almost always have a
 
01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:37.639 align:start position:0%
breeze and
 
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
the I can't think of an environment
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
where you have more fresh air and good
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
air as opposed to I mean
 
01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
there I can site study after study
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
especially a lot amount of California on
 
01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
fresh air and whether the rates of
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
buildup and contaminants inside spaces a
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
lot of work in that area on form
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
Malahide for example and um it's just we
 
01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
know and and I showed that early on in a
 
01:21:05.709 --> 01:21:05.719 align:start position:0%
macro sense that when do people tend to
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
get diseases when they're packed in
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
together when they're inside when the
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
concentrations are higher and two
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
they're closer together there's more
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
people closer together so the best thing
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
in the world is for people to be
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
outdoors spread out you know yeah would
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
you rather not have a bunch of people
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
right together I guess but I'd rather
 
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:25.639 align:start position:0%
have them together Outdoors than indoors
 
01:21:25.639 --> 01:21:27.030 align:start position:0%
have them together Outdoors than indoors
so

01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I I think it would be very hard to
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
prove that many people got sick being
 
01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.750 align:start position:0%
prove that many people got sick being
outdoors

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
outdoors
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um and part of what we're
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
looking here is is not just to look
 
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
backward but also to be able to develop
 
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations going forward which I
 
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
think is very useful here so on on that
 
01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
line obviously you've talked about
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
ventilation if we can't ventilate
 
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
commercial buildings as much because we
 
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
want to keep them energy efficient we're
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
looking to uh filtration and also is
 
01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
there any uh modern technologies that
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
have uh proven effective in eliminating
 
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
virus and bacteria in the air such as I
 
01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
don't know UVC or anything like that yep
 
01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
we're just about
 
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
there um I wouldn't discount in fact we
 
01:22:17.629 --> 01:22:17.639 align:start position:0%
did it I I I told people straight out in
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
the schools let's override the um damper
 
01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
controls on Commercial school
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
buildings um to allow maximum fresh air
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
in because we should end up diluting by
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
a factor of 10 or so now we will have
 
01:22:38.189 --> 01:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
some humidity control issues in the
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
spring and in the
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
fall and we'll just have to deal with
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
that so that was my first solution the
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
second solution as you mentioned is is
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
um we'll get past that we've talked
 
01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:49.870 align:start position:0%
um we'll get past that we've talked
about

01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:51.470 align:start position:0%
about
it

01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
um a second solution is destruction
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
and I looked at a series of Technologies
 
01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
this is in 2020 and I've continued to
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
follow them um because a lot of times
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
when you go to solve a problem you
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
create another problem like early on
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
there was a big push to put Oz ozone
 
01:23:09.679 --> 01:23:11.189 align:start position:0%
there was a big push to put Oz ozone
inside

01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
inside
 
01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
spaces I was against it this goes back
 
01:23:17.629 --> 01:23:17.639 align:start position:0%
in the 90s I was on a lot of committees
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I said no the problem is it's an
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
uncontrolled addition in other words the
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
problem when you added ozone in a in a
 
01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:26.719 align:start position:0%
residential space and I it in my home is
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
there's no control it's like it's like
 
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
having a furnace without a
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
thermostat so you just the furnace comes
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
on and you're either really hot or and
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
it goes off and you're really cold well
 
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
you don't have a control on an ozone
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
generator so the ozone if you're in a
 
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
small house and you got a big ozone
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
system you put too much ozone in and it
 
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
it does its job it destroys
 
01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
tissue but it destroys too much and I
 
01:23:55.149 --> 01:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
walked around with a cough all the time
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
um or it's too small and it's not really
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
doing its job so it's uncontrolled I
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't like it plus it causes
 
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
damage well there's a technology called
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
bipolar ionization technology uh there
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
are multiple vendors the one that's that
 
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
I know the most is new Calgon
 
01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
iWave and it destroys up to 99% of
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
viruses but it also destroys mold and
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
bacteria as well they're about $400
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
they're easy to install the HB guys will
 
01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:27.639 align:start position:0%
charge you 800 because they mark it up
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
but I've installed them in all my
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
businesses all my my homes my friends
 
01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
homes um they're easy to install you
 
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
just need to know how to hook up a hot
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
and a cold I mean a you know a white and
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
a black and a ground to the fan circuit
 
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
they're magnetic they're about I don't
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
know this big maybe 4 by six in and you
 
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
slap them on the side of the fan the
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
squirrel cage
 
01:24:55.229 --> 01:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
fan and voila they and it turns out
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
early on when I was pushing them the
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
data was a little iffy now ashr Journal
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
published in in 2021 actual data showing
 
01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
that they they were uh getting rid of
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 90% of the bacteria per
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
pass and the virus so I that that's what
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
I recommended in the school in the fall
 
01:25:19.229 --> 01:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
2020 they continue to use them as long
 
01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
as well as increased ventilation so
 
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
that's one solution on destruction
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
um people have talked about using
 
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
ionized hydrogen peroxide that's a
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
little more complicated but it does work
 
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
you'll see in all these I've showed what
 
01:25:36.669 --> 01:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
the reduction what the capacity is what
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
they cost
 
01:25:38.239 --> 01:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
they cost
Etc

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:39.250 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:40.430 align:start position:0%
Etc
[Music]

01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:25:42.510 --> 01:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
um there's also I don't know if I have
 
01:25:46.030 --> 01:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
it here yeah ultraviolet is another one
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
UVC um it definitely works the only
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
issue with UVC is
 
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
you you have to have somebody
 
01:25:55.870 --> 01:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
maintaining it in the sense that you got
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
to constantly or at least periodically
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
make sure it's still working the bulbs
 
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
haven't burned out my experience I was
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
director of R&amp;D for Columbia Gas in
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
charge of residential and Commercial is
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
that we have a heck of a time our our
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
appliances we plan on people doing
 
01:26:13.109 --> 01:26:13.119 align:start position:0%
nothing to them because it'll be years
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
before they change filters in some cases
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
so just knowing human nature UVC
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
definitely works as well um it's another
 
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
I think it's one of the two best Sol
 
01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
Solutions probably better in a
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial setting where you
 
01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
have maintenance scheduled
 
01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance the other area is
 
01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
filtration and um I'm not as for this as
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
the other two uh for a couple reasons
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
one um all filters are are given what
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
they call uh a Merv rating minimum
 
01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
efficiency reporting
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
value and your typical HEPA filter had
 
01:26:58.189 --> 01:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
the higher the number the tighter the
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
filter the harder it is for stuff to get
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
through it but also there's more
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
pressure drop so it takes more energy
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
fan energy to push the air pull the air
 
01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:07.510 align:start position:0%
fan energy to push the air pull the air
through

01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:10.719 align:start position:0%
it well it turns out that most HEPA
 
01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
filters are have um Ms that are you know
 
01:27:18.669 --> 01:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
down around 8 n to to separate these
 
01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
small particles you're going to get
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to have a mve
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's at least 16 the problem with that
 
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
is that for especially in a residential
 
01:27:31.629 --> 01:27:31.639 align:start position:0%
setting or a small business
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
setting the fan motor would not be
 
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
sufficient to pull the air through there
 
01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
it would be it would be really hard so
 
01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
you'd have to replace the fan motor that
 
01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.109 align:start position:0%
you'd have to replace the fan motor that
becomes

01:27:41.109 --> 01:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
expensive um and so um the biggest issue
 
01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
in my mind is that you would have to
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
really update the mechanical systems and
 
01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
that that is the way hbac people do is
 
01:27:55.390 --> 01:27:55.400 align:start position:0%
they don't like to modify stuff they
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
expensive uh don't like ozone um there's
 
01:28:07.229 --> 01:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
some stuff called photo catalytic
 
01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:09.639 align:start position:0%
oxidation in the research stages looks
 
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
to be super effective but it's not
 
01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:12.430 align:start position:0%
to be super effective but it's not
commercially

01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
commercially
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
available and then silver has always
 
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
been known as a uh as a bioside
 
01:28:19.229 --> 01:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough the reason that
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
priests and ministers use chalises with
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
silver in them is it kills
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
biologics most people didn't know that
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
um so nanop particles of silver on in
 
01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:35.570 align:start position:0%
fact interestingly enough a lot of the
 
01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:36.870 align:start position:0%
fact interestingly enough a lot of the
[Music]

01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
um uh filters the high efficiency
 
01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
filters or or that are being put in
 
01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:45.719 align:start position:0%
saying they kill uh moldar bacteria or
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
viruses they're all coated with a thin
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.830 align:start position:0%
 
thin

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
thin
 
01:28:58.350 --> 01:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
so um with that I'm not going to I think
 
01:29:00.189 --> 01:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
we've had a chance for me to cover some
 
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
of the comments I've had the the bottom
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
line is mask and n95s can't and will
 
01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:07.719 align:start position:0%
never be the solution to infectious
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
diseases the solutions are
 
01:29:10.159 --> 01:29:11.910 align:start position:0%
diseases the solutions are
filtration

01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
filtration
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
um uh more fresh air or destruction they
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
always have been and um they always will
 
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
be in the future and I appreciate the
 
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk to you folks and um
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'm welcome to answer any questions you
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.830 --> 01:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you and thank you
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
for being here appreciate it
 
01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
um for a typical classroom
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
size how many of these
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
devices or would you you know would it
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
take to deal with that how much would it
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
cost say per
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
classroom to kill off
 
01:29:59.550 --> 01:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
the viruses it depends on if you had um
 
01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
a central system in other words system
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
supplying multiple classrooms then you
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
could have put this new cowon on that
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
and the new kgon would is um it handles
 
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
about equivalent of four tons rule of
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
thumb of cooling so for the rule of
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
thumb is 800 foot per ton so that's 3200
 
01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.070 align:start position:0%
thumb is 800 foot per ton so that's 3200
sare

01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
sare
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
feet so that's going to cover multiple
 
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
classrooms so if you had a wing of
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
classrooms one unit would do that yes
 
01:30:30.109 --> 01:30:30.119 align:start position:0%
now there's there's some technology that
 
01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
I put in here for Standalone systems
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
that have been implemented in Texas yeah
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's in in here in New Hampshire we
 
01:30:40.750 --> 01:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
have a lot of old school buildings that
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
are heated with basically radiators yes
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
and how would you deal with that I have
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
this is the I don't know if I came back
 
01:30:55.229 --> 01:30:55.239 align:start position:0%
up this is this Nova Nova virus air
 
01:30:59.229 --> 01:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
purifier technology and they'll treat
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
they have three different sizes they'll
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
treat 120 F feet 900 square feet which
 
01:31:05.310 --> 01:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
is a good size for a classroom or
 
01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
3,000 and um they've been implemented in
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
a series of in districts in Texas that
 
01:31:17.629 --> 01:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of um I don't have pricing for
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
you but I gave you the link to go and
 
01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
request that but for for um classrooms
 
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
where you you don't have Central systems
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
you would have to use a technology like
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative
 
01:31:37.109 --> 01:31:37.119 align:start position:0%
evil thank you Mr Petty thank you for
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
being here um as it happens oddly enough
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh when when we had to get the New
 
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house back up and running
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
again after covid we looked at the
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
ashray standards we looked at mer
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
filters we looked at filtration system
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
systems representative creten and I were
 
01:31:58.830 --> 01:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
on the same committee and we had a lot
 
01:32:01.149 --> 01:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
to learn about things that we really
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
didn't know a lot about um I can just in
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
response partially to what you said the
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
fix was extremely expensive to get the
 
01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
building back up and running again um
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
and some of the machines that you see
 
01:32:19.109 --> 01:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
around here were things that were our
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
best solution that we could pay for at
 
01:32:24.109 --> 01:32:24.119 align:start position:0%
the time we figured out how quickly
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
could be cleared Etc and I guess um
 
01:32:30.990 --> 01:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
based on the uh testimony that you've
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
given um it's very expensive to retrofit
 
01:32:39.629 --> 01:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of buildings with the Machinery
 
01:32:43.629 --> 01:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
that you have uh discussed here and I
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
just all I'm saying is I know that
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
because we looked at all these things
 
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
and it was very expensive and I'm just
 
01:32:53.229 --> 01:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
trying to understand your testimony if a
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
school for for instance or a building
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
such as ours or whatever was unable to
 
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
afford the technology and the
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that you've described
 
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
here are you saying that it would
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
be rather than um are you saying rather
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
than requiring masking and social
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
distancing in a building where you
 
01:33:20.189 --> 01:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford a lot more fresh air or
 
01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
filtered air it would be better not to
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
have masks and not to bother with social
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
distancing well the answer to the end is
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
yes the I I I would quibble with the
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
cost the cost for us to to implement
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
this technology in 2020 and in a very a
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
pretty large high school with special
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
$24,000 I mean it it wasn't I mean it
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
sounds like a lot of money but not in
 
01:33:53.950 --> 01:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
terms of their operations it wasn't just
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
just to follow up it depends on I'm
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
sorry it depends on the facility and you
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
know uh for one school system 24,000 may
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
not be enough be a lot and for others it
 
01:34:07.470 --> 01:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
might be so let's just if we could
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
assume that it is expensive for a
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
particular facility to upgrade I I just
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that you think without
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
the equipment it still is better not to
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
mask and not to bother social distancing
 
01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
the the the costs far outweigh the
 
01:34:27.390 --> 01:34:27.400 align:start position:0%
benefits on
 
01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
masking um the social distancing with
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
small particles can't possibly
 
01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
work um I I really I believe that there
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
was I don't disagree there was a lack of
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge by people trying to do
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
something to make their erir and their
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
buildings better I do disagree that this
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
was going to be an expensive option
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
because can you imagine instead of all
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
the silly things we did that if if the
 
01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
government had offered every resident
 
01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
through a mechanical contractor
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
$500 to put a new calgone eyew wave in
 
01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
their house wouldn't that have been a
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
lot better solution than what we
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
did uh representative Penza then
 
01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:17.590 align:start position:0%
did uh representative Penza then
representative

01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
Merchant I do know that um well in New
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think it was everywhere
 
01:35:24.910 --> 01:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
all across the country that um you know
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
schools I'm in Rochester got millions of
 
01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
dollars um directly from the federal
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
government to provide uh you know
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
through the cares act to be able to do
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
things um in schools for example in
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
summersworth they instead of um using
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
you know certain protocols they put a
 
01:35:47.070 --> 01:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
new roof on so I I don't think finances
 
01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
were a problem here um did you see that
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
weren't finances weren't an issue across
 
01:35:54.669 --> 01:35:54.679 align:start position:0%
the country because of cares Z
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
money um my experience is not unlike
 
01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
yours I I saw many many situations where
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
there was considerable covid monies
 
01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
provided but they weren't
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
used in a manner that would actually
 
01:36:10.679 --> 01:36:12.510 align:start position:0%
used in a manner that would actually
prevent

01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam chair and Mr
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
Perry thank you for petty for thank you
 
01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:22.679 align:start position:0%
for being here and taking my question
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
besides the economics of the equipment
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
01:36:33.149 --> 01:36:33.159 align:start position:0%
about there were many issues we had in
 
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
the supply chain we wanted to obtain a
 
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
lot of things but our capacity to
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
manufacture them or to make them
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
available in a reasonable period of time
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
was lacking so you my hearing then we
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
had so much capacity and so much
 
01:36:49.709 --> 01:36:49.719 align:start position:0%
availability of all these equipment that
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
we could have done it in a relatively
 
01:36:51.870 --> 01:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
short period of
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
time I believe so I mean we never the
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
the problem with that the problem with
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
giving you an answer on that is we never
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
came close to trying to
 
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
demand um people install say new calone
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
ey waves to see what the limit was I
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
mean we wer even close so I don't know
 
01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
at what point if if we had 20 million
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
people demand
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
that what impact that would have I mean
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
I obviously I have a a strong business
 
01:37:25.149 --> 01:37:25.159 align:start position:0%
background but we never really tested
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
that angle my experience was there to
 
01:37:30.669 --> 01:37:30.679 align:start position:0%
this day you would have zero problem
 
01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
going on Amazon and getting a new calone
 
01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
iway for less than 400
 
01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
bucks that's but me I concur once we get
 
01:37:41.709 --> 01:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
through the supply chain issues we had
 
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
that today availability on certain
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
things is available partly because the
 
01:37:48.189 --> 01:37:48.199 align:start position:0%
demand for things does not exceed our
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
capacity to make them number two one of
 
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
the things in your um presentation I
 
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
want say thank you for this is
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
containment is that correct containment
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
in in what sense I'm sorry containment
 
01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
of the virus destruction oh yeah I mean
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
is that is that a fact I I don't really
 
01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
want to contain it I either want to
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
dilute it or I want to destroy it that's
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
really my goal if I go back to one of
 
01:38:15.149 --> 01:38:15.159 align:start position:0%
your slides it had containment is one of
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
the factors of the
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
three I'm sorry where you at let me see
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
if I
 
01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
can if you go back to slide 24 page 24
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay engineering controls it says
 
01:38:31.629 --> 01:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
destruction dilution and
 
01:38:34.189 --> 01:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
containment am I misreading
 
01:38:34.199 --> 01:38:36.510 align:start position:0%
containment am I misreading
that

01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
construction containment is is where
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
you're filtering it yes I mean in that
 
01:38:44.189 --> 01:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
sense so containment is important in the
 
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
sense if you're going to as a solution
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
to it it's important in the sense that
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
if you were if you had the ability to as
 
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
an engineering
 
01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.550 align:start position:0%
an engineering
control

01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:38:59.310 --> 01:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
to isolate the virus and this is what's
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
being the reason that I say that is
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's what was being done with ebola
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
right I mean you had very specialized
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
facilities I think in Oklahoma for those
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
people coming back from Africa that's
 
01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
probably on the engineering controls
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's an engineering control but probably
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
not a pragmatic one for something as
 
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
widespread as a
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic if I also go back and look on
 
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
slide page 33 up in the right hand
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
corner it says under the
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
aih on the box to your right it says
 
01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
preventing as feasible the spread of a
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
novel pathogen where a motive
 
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
transportation is unknowned unknown
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
requires again OSHA so it's basically
 
01:39:40.159 --> 01:39:40.990 align:start position:0%
requires again OSHA so it's basically
trying

01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
trying
 
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
to contain by minimizing transmission
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
because transmission is a way to
 
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
consider containment is that not again
 
01:39:51.589 --> 01:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
the mask is not so much always to
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
protect the person wearing it but to
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
protect the containment or to provide
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
containment and lack of transmission of
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
the virus that's what it says here on 33
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just reading the the
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
highlighted thing that says that the the
 
01:40:09.790 --> 01:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations from CDC for protection
 
01:40:12.109 --> 01:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
against the pathogen transmitted through
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
the air are grossly deficient and will
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
not protect healthcare workers from
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
aerosol transmission this is where
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
they're being critical because they're
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
still using this droplet argument right
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
which I understand but that's the
 
01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
protecting the person wearing the mask
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
versus trying to contain it through the
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
lack of transmission no no no that that
 
01:40:32.189 --> 01:40:32.199 align:start position:0%
is that's the source control argument
 
01:40:34.189 --> 01:40:34.199 align:start position:0%
that you've heard probably right that
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
argument is completely bogus and the
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
reason I say that is
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
um if if you have a particle that had
 
01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
the The Source control argument is that
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
if you wear a mask or n95 that that you
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
if you're sick will stop um transmission
 
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
to others
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
you're the
 
01:40:58.350 --> 01:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
source but the virus doesn't care
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's coming in or going out this
 
01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:01.189 align:start position:0%
whether it's coming in or going out this
massive

01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
massive
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
hole so the source control argument was
 
01:41:06.109 --> 01:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
always bogus it doesn't matter whether
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
you're the one that's sick or the person
 
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
on the outside's sick that mask is not
 
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
going to stop that virus going One
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
Direction or the other it's not a
 
01:41:14.159 --> 01:41:15.629 align:start position:0%
Direction or the other it's not a
one-way

01:41:15.629 --> 01:41:15.639 align:start position:0%
one-way
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
mask so it might hearing then in the O
 
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have surgeons wearing a
 
01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
mask that's for a different purpose
 
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
that's for these huge droplets and this
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
is this is as I said earlier this is for
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
these huge droplets and uh
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
spum uh the literature is absolutely
 
01:41:37.149 --> 01:41:37.159 align:start position:0%
clear that that the surgical Mass are
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
for those large droplets but not for
 
01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:41.639 align:start position:0%
aerosols and that there's been no
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
study uh that shown that wearing a
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
surgical mask protects either the
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
surgeon or the patient from infectious
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
diseases those are aerosols those are
 
01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
little guys so so that that is the
 
01:41:58.189 --> 01:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
confusion to be candid as an exposure
 
01:42:00.189 --> 01:42:00.199 align:start position:0%
expert that lies out there is people do
 
01:42:02.550 --> 01:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
see Physicians wearing masks and they
 
01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
think well they they're doing some good
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
they're doing some good with respect to
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
these large the big guys the droplets
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
but they're not doing any good with
 
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
aerosols yes ma'am repres creation thank
 
01:42:19.470 --> 01:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you for taking my question
 
01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:20.709 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you for taking my question
again

01:42:20.709 --> 01:42:20.719 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
so I I've not seen any study that said
 
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
that an n95 would not reduce the dose
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's transmitted by a person who's
 
01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:33.550 align:start position:0%
that's transmitted by a person who's
infected

01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
infected
 
01:42:36.589 --> 01:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
to the rain study just came out
 
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of like
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
the it's it's the meta analysis of the
 
01:42:45.070 --> 01:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
RCT so it's it says that
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
explicitly it says that in real world
 
01:42:51.310 --> 01:42:51.320 align:start position:0%
situations it's unclear if it reduces
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
transmission or not but in terms of
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:01.110 align:start position:0%
being the the difficulty is that
 
01:43:01.110 --> 01:43:04.229 align:start position:0%
being the the difficulty is that
[Music]

01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:43:07.149 --> 01:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
um the particles are so small and the
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
gaps are relatively so large that that
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
physically just can't
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
happen it's like trying to stop a BB
 
01:43:19.709 --> 01:43:19.719 align:start position:0%
with a soccer net do you randomly have
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
one hit the mesh once in a while I guess
 
01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
but and then beyond that you
 
01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
have you have the world of the gaps on
 
01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:30.470 align:start position:0%
have you have the world of the gaps on
the

01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
outside which overwhelm everything in
 
01:43:34.510 --> 01:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
other words I say to Everybody Let's
 
01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
imagine you have
 
01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:38.190 align:start position:0%
smoke uh in a
 
01:43:38.190 --> 01:43:39.430 align:start position:0%
smoke uh in a
[Music]

01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
room and uh you're waiting for it to to
 
01:43:45.870 --> 01:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
come through the wall but then you have
 
01:43:47.709 --> 01:43:47.719 align:start position:0%
a window that's open but where is it
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
going to go it always goes to the pathol
 
01:43:51.790 --> 01:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
Le resistance so it's of course going to
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
come right out the window if you have
 
01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
big gaps that's where all the stuff's
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
moving back and forth either coming in
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
or going out um like I said the source
 
01:44:03.229 --> 01:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
control arguments always been Bogus the
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
the virus isn't if you got a super
 
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
freeway it's not going to be able to go
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
one way through it and then the other
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
way it can't I mean that's just silly I
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
don't know where that came from the
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
source control argument to me has always
 
01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:15.189 align:start position:0%
source control argument to me has always
been

01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
bogus uh represent
 
01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
licas so
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
when when we have like the pyramid or
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
yeah the inverted pyramid the hierarchy
 
01:44:32.229 --> 01:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
of controls right and containment is in
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
there that inverted pyramid is a general
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
for all things for all hazards it could
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
be for silica or anything else yes right
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
so containment may be more appropriate
 
01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:46.870 align:start position:0%
so containment may be more appropriate
for

01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:44:49.629 --> 01:44:49.639 align:start position:0%
some issues than for you know for some
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
contaminants than for others is that
 
01:44:54.629 --> 01:44:54.639 align:start position:0%
yeah and and containment would be approp
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
more appropriate for Co if it had a
 
01:44:59.830 --> 01:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
50% I mean you wouldn't want to allow
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
like Ebola you
 
01:45:07.709 --> 01:45:07.719 align:start position:0%
don't you you want to isolate everything
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
and everyone because the consequences
 
01:45:12.669 --> 01:45:12.679 align:start position:0%
are so dire as I said before one of the
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
problems with MKS are that The lethality
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
of covid thank God was so low overall
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
still a lot of people
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
died that people really didn't know
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
whether it was doing any good or not now
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
you would know for sure if one out of
 
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
two people wearing something didn't
 
01:45:33.629 --> 01:45:33.639 align:start position:0%
work how would you do containment then
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
for an an
 
01:45:39.629 --> 01:45:39.639 align:start position:0%
Airborne virus or other contaminant how
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
well for an Airborne virus how would you
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
do containment I don't think you can in
 
01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
general the only way you can do
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
containment is it is very early
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
on like like the Ebola cases where you
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
try to isolate just a hand of people
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
sick but once it's a pandemic it's by
 
01:45:57.870 --> 01:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
definition not
 
01:45:59.950 --> 01:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
contained okay thank you um you're
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
welcome Mr Petty um coming from an
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
agricultural background when I look at
 
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
containment I look at a spill um as
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
being contained and I understand that
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
there's other containments um but I
 
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
think you mentioned earlier that the n95
 
01:46:17.709 --> 01:46:17.719 align:start position:0%
cannot be used for asbest is that
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
correct yeah it's it's legally not
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
allowed for example in the state of
 
01:46:26.350 --> 01:46:26.360 align:start position:0%
California no is as Festus larger or
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
smaller in microns than the covid virus
 
01:46:32.910 --> 01:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
on average about 50 times larger thank
 
01:46:36.430 --> 01:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Belcher and then
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative penzer and then we're
 
01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
going to wrap it up we have another I've
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
got just two quick ones they shouldn't
 
01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:44.719 align:start position:0%
take too long um first one is because we
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned and I've had this experience
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
as well with my h house water filter
 
01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:48.990 align:start position:0%
as well with my h house water filter
with

01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:46:51.189 --> 01:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
UVC whatever reason there doesn't seem
 
01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
to be a high availability of LED UVC
 
01:46:56.589 --> 01:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
technology is there you have any reason
 
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
for that and is that something that we
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
could in a report perhaps appeal to the
 
01:47:02.189 --> 01:47:02.199 align:start position:0%
private sector to work
 
01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
toward I think the issue there has to do
 
01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
with wavelength because obviously the
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
UVC is at the thing that's destructive
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
is the wavelength and I don't think LEDs
 
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
have the right
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
wavelength that's good to know and uh
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
one more quick one we received testimony
 
01:47:20.350 --> 01:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
regarding uh the methods that we tried
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire it was described
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
um in its totality this includes masking
 
01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
and all the other things as well as
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
social distancing that were used it was
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
described as the Swiss cheese method I
 
01:47:34.270 --> 01:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
guess the idea being that you're just
 
01:47:37.149 --> 01:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
layering these layers of Swiss cheese on
 
01:47:38.589 --> 01:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
top of each other till there's no holes
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
left is the analogy um do you think such
 
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
a method of trying to approach this was
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
a make doesn't make sense B do you think
 
01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
it was reasonable and best practice and
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
C is there any reason to believe believe
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
that it actually
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
worked I think there was a
 
01:48:02.109 --> 01:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
desire by the public to try to help
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
understandably so I think people in
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
political leadership positions offered a
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
inexpensive solution that had no chance
 
01:48:15.149 --> 01:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
of working and in
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
fact uh move the ball away from things
 
01:48:22.510 --> 01:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
that would have worked and that was if
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
you can imagine the amount of time and
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
energy associated with masking and all
 
01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
this and putting all these little dots
 
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
in in stores what if we' had up at I can
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
guarantee it wouldn't have cost as much
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
money as putting new Calgon eye waves in
 
01:48:39.589 --> 01:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
systems so the answer is that we got
 
01:48:47.709 --> 01:48:47.719 align:start position:0%
distracted by non-science Solutions
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
frankly and that I mean appreciate I
 
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
work on the most liberal side of the
 
01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
world toxic
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
Tor I've I've worked I work on all the
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
big cases I'm the expert on all almost
 
01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
all the big cases if I thought for two
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
seconds that this was th this was of
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
concern to my clients that I was out
 
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:11.800 align:start position:0%
there speaking out and I said I haven't
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
changed I've always been about
 
01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
protecting workers in the public this
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that I have an obligation
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
giving my credentials and background to
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
say something and I did and I did it all
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
all pro
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
bono to the tune of hundreds of
 
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars which is fine I I
 
01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
have his favorite phrase I say to people
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
all the time I said at the end of the
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
day it says under your Tombstone born
 
01:49:37.709 --> 01:49:37.719 align:start position:0%
and died the question is did you do any
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
good in
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
between now I'm I also say that I'm
 
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
probably not up for sainthood I think
 
01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
Earth purgatory and I'm due for return
 
01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
visit I just hope I don't have to go to
 
01:49:47.199 --> 01:49:49.510 align:start position:0%
visit I just hope I don't have to go to
school

01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
again representative Penza and then
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
representative Eble and then we will
 
01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
close this
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
hearing so I'm not sure if you remember
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
but I met you um when I was in a rep so
 
01:50:04.669 --> 01:50:04.679 align:start position:0%
and we talked okay so my husband um
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
works for the the largest um HVAC
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
Plumbing all of that in um in the
 
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
Northeast they're in nine states and I
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
just wanted to speak to some of the
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
equipment that I had showed you that he
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
had sent to the school that my kids were
 
01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
at um was in your repertoire at the time
 
01:50:27.149 --> 01:50:27.159 align:start position:0%
correct correct do you remember that
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
okay so um and at the time I just wanted
 
01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
to speak to this because I think it's
 
01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
important there was no problem at all
 
01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
with Supply um we didn't have there
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't a huge demand on it and at that
 
01:50:42.589 --> 01:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
time FW web which I know I told you said
 
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
that they could probably Supply almost
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
every single school in the state with
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
this equipment to help whether they had
 
01:50:51.310 --> 01:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
a newer school and could put it directly
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
into the ventilation system system or if
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
it was classroom specific like what is
 
01:50:57.910 --> 01:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
here right now yeah my my comment
 
01:51:00.270 --> 01:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
earlier was I mean the hpac industry is
 
01:51:02.910 --> 01:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
massive in fact ashray their meeting is
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
the largest meeting of any organization
 
01:51:07.950 --> 01:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
in the United States is my understanding
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
there it's a huge business um and so I
 
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
think it was never
 
01:51:17.709 --> 01:51:17.719 align:start position:0%
tapped um the only reason I was being
 
01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
balanced about my response to the other
 
01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:20.870 align:start position:0%
balanced about my response to the other
rep

01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
rep
 
01:51:24.910 --> 01:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
was we you know some point you do have a
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
supply and demand issue I don't know
 
01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:28.639 align:start position:0%
where that is but we never came close to
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
it that's the problem so I was just
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
trying to be honest about at some point
 
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
you would see a point where perhaps
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
there would be an issue I don't know but
 
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
we never came even close to that and
 
01:51:40.750 --> 01:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
it's a huge huge
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
business represent Vil and thank you
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
madam chair there was one more question
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
yeah oh I'm sorry um I was just GNA ask
 
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
um going back to the studies that you
 
01:51:56.430 --> 01:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier were and the effects
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
of masks versus
 
01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
covid were there other factors
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
considered in those studies or were they
 
01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
just look looking at uh the effect of
 
01:52:09.709 --> 01:52:09.719 align:start position:0%
masking because it's very difficult with
 
01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
studies the whole issue of control and
 
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know other things that were going on
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
with the people that were masking sure
 
01:52:24.510 --> 01:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
um the key is to have well-designed
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
rcts uh that's what you want to look at
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
where you try to control it's impossible
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
to control everything but you try to
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
control as best you can to a single
 
01:52:34.350 --> 01:52:34.360 align:start position:0%
change in parameter with a similar
 
01:52:37.709 --> 01:52:37.719 align:start position:0%
population the the problem was that CDC
 
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
started supporting masking uh by studies
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they were funding that were
 
01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
observational which is if you look at
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
the PID of of studies under epidemiology
 
01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
observational are much lower than say
 
01:52:53.599 --> 01:52:55.189 align:start position:0%
observational are much lower than say
rcts

01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
rcts
 
01:52:58.350 --> 01:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
and I I felt strongly so what I did is I
 
01:52:59.629 --> 01:52:59.639 align:start position:0%
started going because I had to go
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
through them in court cases right and
 
01:53:04.030 --> 01:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
there were like 50 of them so I would go
 
01:53:05.709 --> 01:53:05.719 align:start position:0%
through each study and I would critique
 
01:53:07.390 --> 01:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
them and show them where they were they
 
01:53:08.669 --> 01:53:08.679 align:start position:0%
were co-founders or they were
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
fundamental problems with their
 
01:53:11.790 --> 01:53:11.800 align:start position:0%
statistics or whatever I had a years
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
where The Graduate level statistics and
 
01:53:16.069 --> 01:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
then I felt strongly enough about it
 
01:53:18.270 --> 01:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
that I put together some podcasts I
 
01:53:19.950 --> 01:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
think four or five of them where I went
 
01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
through all of those not I don't know if
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
they're all but most of the CDC studies
 
01:53:26.189 --> 01:53:26.199 align:start position:0%
on where the flaws were and I put them
 
01:53:30.109 --> 01:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
up on YouTube and rumble or something
 
01:53:32.109 --> 01:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
just to get that information out there
 
01:53:34.589 --> 01:53:34.599 align:start position:0%
as to to why these studies these
 
01:53:37.629 --> 01:53:37.639 align:start position:0%
observational studies were really had
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
issues I'm not the first one to say that
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
um it's pretty well established science
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
that you want to move towards rcts
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
mainly in in almost all Dimensions
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
because you want to you want to limit
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
the co-founders as much as you can the
 
01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
things that would also impact the
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
results and you want to have two groups
 
01:54:01.229 --> 01:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
uh ideally blinded where one group has
 
01:54:02.910 --> 01:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
is given the drug or is given the
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
masking and the other group isn't and
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
it's a little hard to Blind that but um
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
The Hope is then then you can see the
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
difference and there aren't co-founders
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
results uh ma'am last
 
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
question please thank you for indulging
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
me I'll try to keep it brief um I guess
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
just thinking back to the early days of
 
01:54:29.069 --> 01:54:29.079 align:start position:0%
the pandemic when it wasn't like fully
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
clear whether it was droplet spread or
 
01:54:35.149 --> 01:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
or Airborne spread um I gu do you have
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
any hypotheses as to why it kind of took
 
01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
us so long to get to that idea that it
 
01:54:43.390 --> 01:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
was airborne and that air quality would
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
be a better way to go and thinking about
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know oh we never got you know even
 
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
close to having supply chain issues with
 
01:54:54.430 --> 01:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
with a quality and things why do you
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
think that was and what do you think
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
that we could do to avoid that in the
 
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
future or sort of jump toward this
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
because I agree that that the sort of
 
01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
industrial controls is is a much better
 
01:55:07.870 --> 01:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
way to go than relying on you know
 
01:55:10.990 --> 01:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
individuals to to figure out mask fit
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
and how many people they can have in a
 
01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
room and that sort of thing well having
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
done this for 45 years I I will be blunt
 
01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
I usually am in front of juries that's
 
01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
science was well known for decades we
 
01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
were lied to we were lied to about the
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
fact that the issue was droplets we
 
01:55:33.790 --> 01:55:33.800 align:start position:0%
still are being lied to and that's why
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
you have two major I mean it takes time
 
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
to write a 28-page letter to CDC and get
 
01:55:42.030 --> 01:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
get it reviewed by six other scientists
 
01:55:44.069 --> 01:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
and and the one before me the year
 
01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
before me I wasn't involved in that did
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
the same thing saying look go back and
 
01:55:50.069 --> 01:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
read them we're
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
saying this is not an issue of rets this
 
01:55:54.270 --> 01:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
is an issue of
 
01:55:58.109 --> 01:55:58.119 align:start position:0%
aerosols it's a virus we know this I
 
01:56:00.069 --> 01:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
mean yeah are there differences between
 
01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
a flu virus and a covid virus a little
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
bit but in terms of particle sizes and a
 
01:56:06.910 --> 01:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
lot of the ways we deal with them no not
 
01:56:11.950 --> 01:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
really so um so that the bottom line is
 
01:56:14.669 --> 01:56:14.679 align:start position:0%
I guess I hate to be that strong but
 
01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.030 --> 01:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
to okay thank you everyone uh thank you
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
m to Petty uh for coming um really
 
01:56:27.310 --> 01:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate it very informative um
 
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
answers a lot of my
 
01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:30.790 align:start position:0%
answers a lot of my
questions

01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:56:34.709 --> 01:56:34.719 align:start position:0%
um so again thank you so much um if you
 
01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
could email me this presentation I would
 
01:56:39.149 --> 01:56:39.159 align:start position:0%
uh I would love to email it out to the
 
01:56:40.510 --> 01:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
committee members I know we have a hard
 
01:56:43.069 --> 01:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
copy here but sometimes uh and if you
 
01:56:45.550 --> 01:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
could also put in that uh some of where
 
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
we could go look at some of your
 
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
podcasts um so if anyone has more
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
questions they can review those I'd
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that just go to Petty
 
01:56:58.069 --> 01:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
podcast on rumble or YouTube um I will
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
send you a PDF of it and thank you very
 
01:57:02.350 --> 01:57:02.360 align:start position:0%
much to all members of the committee and
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
to you chairman for the opportunity and
 
01:57:07.069 --> 01:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
um best of wishes and making good
 
01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
decisions thank you and we'll close out
 
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
this hearing um and while Mr Petty uh
 
01:57:14.350 --> 01:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
closes up why don't we take a uh three
 
01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:16.639 align:start position:0%
minute break and
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%

if members can take their seats we'll
 
02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:34.470 align:start position:0%
if members can take their seats we'll
get

02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:37.470 --> 02:04:37.480 align:start position:0%
started I'd like to thank Dr uh cuor
 
02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
from coming up uh to speak with us today
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
and um as you can see he's a former
 
02:04:46.830 --> 02:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
professor of medicine from Harvard and
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
I'll let him introduce his credentials
 
02:04:50.639 --> 02:04:54.629 align:start position:0%
I'll let him introduce his credentials
also

02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:56.350 --> 02:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh ple please turn on your microphone
 
02:04:58.870 --> 02:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much for having
 
02:05:04.109 --> 02:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
me and I'm a a bio statistician and uh
 
02:05:05.950 --> 02:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
infectious disease
 
02:05:09.229 --> 02:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
ecologist I used to be a professor at of
 
02:05:12.510 --> 02:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
medicine at Harvard for first Associated
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
and then full for about 20 years until
 
02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
they didn't want me
 
02:05:20.069 --> 02:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
anymore um and I was kind of shocked
 
02:05:22.109 --> 02:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
when the pandemic come came because I'm
 
02:05:24.510 --> 02:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
an infectious disease technologist and
 
02:05:26.069 --> 02:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
basically all the principles of Public
 
02:05:28.030 --> 02:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
Health were thrown out the
 
02:05:30.549 --> 02:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
window so I'm going to talk about
 
02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
specifically is um yeah first that's a
 
02:05:37.149 --> 02:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
background about covid and age and then
 
02:05:40.109 --> 02:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
talk about the two sort of
 
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
approaches uh that were used the
 
02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
lockdowns versus the focus
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
protection and then I'm going to talk
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
about some of the collateral Public
 
02:05:50.270 --> 02:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
Health damage a little bit about
 
02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
education also uh but I'm a public
 
02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
health person and then some comparison
 
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
about different places and then a little
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
bit about social
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
inequalities um and uh if you have any
 
02:06:05.669 --> 02:06:05.679 align:start position:0%
specific questions just interrupt me and
 
02:06:07.310 --> 02:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
I think we'll have a question Q&amp;A
 
02:06:11.229 --> 02:06:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:13.709 --> 02:06:13.719 align:start position:0%
also uh
 
02:06:17.830 --> 02:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
so when the co uh when I heard first
 
02:06:20.109 --> 02:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
about the covid and there was these
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
outbreaks in Northern Italy and which
 
02:06:24.589 --> 02:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
was the first places outside of
 
02:06:27.310 --> 02:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
China um I was kind of scared for about
 
02:06:31.390 --> 02:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
10 20 minutes um because I went to look
 
02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
at the data from vuhan at at this time
 
02:06:35.189 --> 02:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
there was no death I think in the US so
 
02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
I looked at the mortality in the vuhan
 
02:06:39.390 --> 02:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
and obviously everybody would be exposed
 
02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
but uh there's a I looked at the age of
 
02:06:45.549 --> 02:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
the people who died in vuhan and there
 
02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
was mostly older people so I did a a
 
02:06:51.189 --> 02:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
little calculation to see we didn't know
 
02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
then the the the absolute magnitud of
 
02:06:54.990 --> 02:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
the risk but I could look at the
 
02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
relative risk different age group and it
 
02:07:00.030 --> 02:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
was clear that there were more than a
 
02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
thousandfold difference in mortality
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
risk between the oldest and the youngest
 
02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
people so that's very important to know
 
02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
when you decide what to do about it
 
02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
because it basically means we have to do
 
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
a really good job protecting all the
 
02:07:14.589 --> 02:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
people because they at high risk but we
 
02:07:17.229 --> 02:07:17.239 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about uh the kids so
 
02:07:19.149 --> 02:07:19.159 align:start position:0%
the reason I was only afraid for 10 20
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
minutes was because I have three kids uh
 
02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
as as every parent I'm much more
 
02:07:25.549 --> 02:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
concerned about my children than myself
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
so I knew that they were going to be
 
02:07:31.229 --> 02:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:34.750 --> 02:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
them uh so here are the later on we do
 
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
more about what the infection fatality
 
02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
rate is and we can see that uh for
 
02:07:46.510 --> 02:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
example uh if you are a a woman 80 plus
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
with no underlying condition you have
 
02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:52.679 align:start position:0%
about a 1% risk of dying from covid
 
02:07:53.669 --> 02:07:53.679 align:start position:0%
on the other
 
02:07:56.549 --> 02:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
hand and you have a 99% chance of
 
02:08:00.470 --> 02:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
surviving on the other hand if you are a
 
02:08:05.910 --> 02:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
girl uh age0 to uh 19 your probability
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
of surviving Co is
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
99.9999 6% which is almost
 
02:08:15.229 --> 02:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
100 so you can see here also the
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
enormous gradient in ag and that was
 
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
something that was forgotten during the
 
02:08:21.669 --> 02:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
pandemic but we sort of ignored it as so
 
02:08:23.109 --> 02:08:23.119 align:start position:0%
just pretending that everybody was at
 
02:08:24.629 --> 02:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
risk and we have to treat everybody the
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:32.549 --> 02:08:32.559 align:start position:0%
protection so uh in most of the world uh
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
lockdowns were
 
02:08:35.549 --> 02:08:35.559 align:start position:0%
implemented and
 
02:08:38.189 --> 02:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
lockdowns have many components and there
 
02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
was variation of course in different
 
02:08:43.069 --> 02:08:43.079 align:start position:0%
places but schools and universities were
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
closed for so was online
 
02:08:47.790 --> 02:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
learning uh no extracurricular
 
02:08:49.870 --> 02:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
activities for kids playing soccer or
 
02:08:52.830 --> 02:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
baseball or dance class or so on
 
02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
businesses were closed uh restaurants
 
02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:56.270 align:start position:0%
businesses were closed uh restaurants
were

02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
closed uh a lot of people were told to
 
02:08:59.910 --> 02:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
work from
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
home uh in some places and cases people
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
were told to stay at home stay indoors
 
02:09:07.549 --> 02:09:07.559 align:start position:0%
at home and we learned from the previous
 
02:09:09.470 --> 02:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
speak that that wasn't the smartest
 
02:09:12.589 --> 02:09:12.599 align:start position:0%
thing to do uh we closed Parks
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
playgrounds and
 
02:09:18.270 --> 02:09:18.280 align:start position:0%
beaches uh I think uh also based on the
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
previous I mean Outdoors is the safest
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
place to be because Z win so I would say
 
02:09:24.910 --> 02:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
there's probably not a during the
 
02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic the safest Pro place to be was
 
02:09:28.589 --> 02:09:28.599 align:start position:0%
probably on the top of Mount Washington
 
02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
because there's so which wi there
 
02:09:36.149 --> 02:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
that uh they were vaccine passports so
 
02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
if people didn't have vaccines they w't
 
02:09:40.350 --> 02:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to do things there were travel
 
02:09:42.069 --> 02:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
restrictions both internationally but
 
02:09:43.750 --> 02:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
also between
 
02:09:47.149 --> 02:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
states um no inperson religious services
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
or cultural
 
02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
activities social and physical distance
 
02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
Ing and cancel medical
 
02:09:57.549 --> 02:09:57.559 align:start position:0%
appointments and and care so there's a
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
whole range of these uh lockdowns that
 
02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:01.709 align:start position:0%
whole range of these uh lockdowns that
were

02:10:01.709 --> 02:10:01.719 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
implemented Focus protection the
 
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
argument was that we should do
 
02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
everything we can to protect older
 
02:10:08.910 --> 02:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
people because they're the one at high
 
02:10:11.189 --> 02:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
risk we should let children go to school
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
and enjoy their friends have a social
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
life and young and middle AG adults may
 
02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
live near normal lives uh to minimize
 
02:10:21.069 --> 02:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
the collateral damage from the pandemic
 
02:10:23.669 --> 02:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
meas from the
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
lockdowns so uh how to protect the old
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
well one is to prioritize the old for
 
02:10:31.229 --> 02:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
vaccinations both within countries and
 
02:10:31.239 --> 02:10:32.270 align:start position:0%
vaccinations both within countries and
between

02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:10:34.549 --> 02:10:34.559 align:start position:0%
countries uh using people who have
 
02:10:36.390 --> 02:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
recovered from Co because they have
 
02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
natural immunity or vaccine acquired
 
02:10:42.189 --> 02:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
immunity to use them to staff uh nursing
 
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
homes and other places where older very
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
frail people live they are the least
 
02:10:48.870 --> 02:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
likely to infect them minimize staff
 
02:10:51.629 --> 02:10:51.639 align:start position:0%
rotation in nursing homes let older
 
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
people work from home uh and if possible
 
02:10:56.549 --> 02:10:56.559 align:start position:0%
offer them some pay temporary sabatical
 
02:10:58.229 --> 02:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
during Peak transmission maybe using
 
02:11:00.750 --> 02:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
Social Security funds or something
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
minimize multigenerational living with
 
02:11:05.709 --> 02:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
temporary housing let students be be at
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
the universities where they if they get
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
infected they will infect other young
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
people instead of infecting their older
 
02:11:12.189 --> 02:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
parents or
 
02:11:14.350 --> 02:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
grandparents uh home delivery of food
 
02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
and Necessities as to old people meet
 
02:11:18.990 --> 02:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
Outdoors instead of indoors and Etc so
 
02:11:20.589 --> 02:11:20.599 align:start position:0%
there's a long list of things one can do
 
02:11:23.069 --> 02:11:23.079 align:start position:0%
to protect all the people some of those
 
02:11:24.990 --> 02:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
things were done but I would say most of
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
them were not actually
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
implemented so in 20120 together with uh
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh Dr J Baya from Stanford and Dr sonat
 
02:11:36.910 --> 02:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
Gupta from Oxford who is the preeminent
 
02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
infection to Technologies in the world
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh we we wrote a grand PR iteration to
 
02:11:45.069 --> 02:11:45.079 align:start position:0%
argue for Focus protection and uh it
 
02:11:47.470 --> 02:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
receiv received a lot of attention a lot
 
02:11:49.950 --> 02:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
of people signed it including uh
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
scientists and healthcare workers but it
 
02:11:55.629 --> 02:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
also received a lot of uh push back from
 
02:11:59.549 --> 02:11:59.559 align:start position:0%
the uh sort of established uh uh
 
02:11:59.559 --> 02:12:02.229 align:start position:0%
the uh sort of established uh uh
establishment

02:12:02.229 --> 02:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
02:12:06.109 --> 02:12:06.119 align:start position:0%
so so what does Lockdown do well
 
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
lockdowns can postpone things because if
 
02:12:10.910 --> 02:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
you don't meet people then there is less
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
transmission so you do reduce the the
 
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
amount of Transmissions you can postpone
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
things but that means you're dragging
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
out for longer because you cannot
 
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
prevent this from spreading it was clear
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
very ear on to any competent infectious
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
disease apologist that it hit Northern
 
02:12:27.549 --> 02:12:27.559 align:start position:0%
Italy and Iran it did it in a of a
 
02:12:31.229 --> 02:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
stealth manner it uh we didn't know who
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
brought it into Italy for example and it
 
02:12:34.270 --> 02:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
was circulating for quite some time
 
02:12:35.629 --> 02:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
before we know there was anything going
 
02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
on so it was sort of Brewing under the
 
02:12:39.629 --> 02:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
surface and then it exploded so so just
 
02:12:42.430 --> 02:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
like influenza it is impossible it was
 
02:12:44.350 --> 02:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
impossible to do it so it was very clear
 
02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
in early
 
02:12:48.109 --> 02:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
2020 that is will spread to the whole
 
02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
world sooner or
 
02:12:51.669 --> 02:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
later um
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
so lockdowns doesn't prevent that it can
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
postpone things and New Zealand was the
 
02:12:59.229 --> 02:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
most successful at postponing thing
 
02:13:00.549 --> 02:13:00.559 align:start position:0%
because they an island they were in the
 
02:13:02.229 --> 02:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
southern hemisphere so they could sort
 
02:13:05.229 --> 02:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
of completely isolate themselves uh so
 
02:13:07.149 --> 02:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
what is the good with this thing well
 
02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
it's good to flatten the curve to
 
02:13:10.270 --> 02:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
prevent Health Care overload we don't
 
02:13:13.229 --> 02:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
want everybody to be uh sick at the same
 
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
time but primarily what is important
 
02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
there is ex actually to protect also the
 
02:13:19.270 --> 02:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
older people because they are the one
 
02:13:20.549 --> 02:13:20.559 align:start position:0%
who will go to the hospital if they get
 
02:13:22.830 --> 02:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
infected so so uh so that flattens the
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
curve also the bad thing it actually
 
02:13:26.549 --> 02:13:26.559 align:start position:0%
makes it harder to protect older
 
02:13:28.430 --> 02:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
highrisk people people because you have
 
02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
to protect them for a longer time time
 
02:13:33.189 --> 02:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
period until the pandemic is
 
02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
over uh and of course the longer
 
02:13:37.750 --> 02:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
lockdown the more collateral damage
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
there is and we're seeing um we're
 
02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
seeing now the the huge effect of the
 
02:13:46.510 --> 02:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
collateral damage because while covid is
 
02:13:48.189 --> 02:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
very much there that week people are
 
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
getting sick or that month a lot of the
 
02:13:52.510 --> 02:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
collateral damage much is long-term
 
02:13:54.430 --> 02:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
rather than shortterm and that's one of
 
02:13:56.069 --> 02:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
the principles of Public Health the two
 
02:13:58.589 --> 02:13:58.599 align:start position:0%
principle is you can't just worry about
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
one disease you have to worry about all
 
02:14:02.109 --> 02:14:02.119 align:start position:0%
public health you can't just worry about
 
02:14:04.109 --> 02:14:04.119 align:start position:0%
Co you also have to concern about cancer
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular disease and mental health
 
02:14:07.390 --> 02:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
the other thing you can't just look at
 
02:14:08.510 --> 02:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
shortterm you have to look at the
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
long-term consequences so we had Mis
 
02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
cancer screening and treatments worst
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular disease outcomes skip
 
02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
diabetics diabetic appointments
 
02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
plummeting childhood vaccination rates
 
02:14:21.950 --> 02:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
deteriorating Mental Health malnutrition
 
02:14:25.270 --> 02:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
and starvation in the developing world
 
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh so this was a complete disaster um
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
and I just going to give you there's
 
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of studies now showing
 
02:14:34.990 --> 02:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
this collateral damage on public health
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to show a few example
 
02:14:36.719 --> 02:14:37.629 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to show a few example
here's

02:14:37.629 --> 02:14:37.639 align:start position:0%
here's
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
cancer uh this is from the spring of
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
202 so uh the Baseline is for example if
 
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
you look at the left there there were
 
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
over 2,000 for breast cancer newly
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
identified patient per week and a month
 
02:14:56.589 --> 02:14:56.599 align:start position:0%
later it was only about a
 
02:14:59.549 --> 02:14:59.559 align:start position:0%
thousand that's not because Co prevents
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
cancer is because the cancer is there
 
02:15:03.910 --> 02:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
but it's not detecting there the reason
 
02:15:05.830 --> 02:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
we want to know if somebody has cancer
 
02:15:07.390 --> 02:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
because you can start a
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
treatment so Health Care is actually a
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
good thing we need to people to get the
 
02:15:13.870 --> 02:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
health care so if you don't even detect
 
02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
the cancer they not getting getting it
 
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
now they're not going to die in 2020
 
02:15:21.229 --> 02:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
from breast cancer probably not in 202
 
02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
or 22 or 23 either but
 
02:15:28.109 --> 02:15:28.119 align:start position:0%
somebody who uh who
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
might might not die two or three years
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
from now instead of living another 20
 
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
years so this is consequences that we
 
02:15:37.549 --> 02:15:37.559 align:start position:0%
are not living with can I ask a question
 
02:15:40.189 --> 02:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
yeah hi yes on on this slide and the
 
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
previous slide what is the point because
 
02:15:44.750 --> 02:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
we know that we know that everything was
 
02:15:48.030 --> 02:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed and so we know that other
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
things were missed so are you ascribe
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
being it's someone's fault like can you
 
02:15:57.390 --> 02:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
explain further yeah so it wasn't
 
02:15:58.510 --> 02:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
actually that the hospitals were
 
02:16:00.030 --> 02:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed because a lot of hospitals
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
were empty and a lot of hosp during the
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
covid uh so some hospitals overwhelmed
 
02:16:06.589 --> 02:16:06.599 align:start position:0%
like in New York for example in the
 
02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
spring of 2020 they were quite
 
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed in New York City but uh in
 
02:16:13.589 --> 02:16:13.599 align:start position:0%
other places of the country the the the
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
virus hadn't arrived yet so the
 
02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals were actually close to empty
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
in many places because they didn't have
 
02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
covid patients but the patient did not
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
go to their regular screening activities
 
02:16:26.830 --> 02:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
they didn't go to if they have if they
 
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
had a heart problem they stayed home and
 
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
many died at home instead of actually
 
02:16:33.469 --> 02:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
going to the hospitals to get the proper
 
02:16:36.190 --> 02:16:36.200 align:start position:0%
care so this is effect not on the fact
 
02:16:38.270 --> 02:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
that there was a lot of covid is in the
 
02:16:40.709 --> 02:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
is from the fact that people didn't seek
 
02:16:42.389 --> 02:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
the health care they were afraid to go
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
to the hospitals or in some cases things
 
02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
was postponed like for example the
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
dental care tended to be they close the
 
02:16:52.110 --> 02:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
offices they postpone the dental care
 
02:16:53.790 --> 02:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
the dental care doesn't take care of any
 
02:16:55.309 --> 02:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
covid patients so has nothing to do with
 
02:16:57.070 --> 02:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
Co it was just part of the lockdown that
 
02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
they closed things down so these
 
02:17:03.509 --> 02:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
lockdowns that was that was due because
 
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the covid they lock down but they did
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
it was not necessary to look down so for
 
02:17:10.349 --> 02:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
example Sweden did not look down his
 
02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
healthc care
 
02:17:16.349 --> 02:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
system uh uh and we will get back to
 
02:17:18.429 --> 02:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
Sweden but that's a very good question
 
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:21.509 align:start position:0%
so thank
you

02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:17:24.270 --> 02:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
um here we can see us cancer incidents
 
02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
2018 to 2020 so it goes a little bit up
 
02:17:29.389 --> 02:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
and down like a random variation from
 
02:17:33.150 --> 02:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
2018 um and so on and then suddenly in
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
2020 it plummets and again that's not
 
02:17:37.629 --> 02:17:37.639 align:start position:0%
because people didn't have cancer it
 
02:17:40.349 --> 02:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't detected and you would hope that
 
02:17:41.950 --> 02:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
then would sort of be a corresponding
 
02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
going above to sort of catch all those
 
02:17:47.549 --> 02:17:47.559 align:start position:0%
things that's were where we missed but
 
02:17:50.589 --> 02:17:50.599 align:start position:0%
while it does Rebound it's still Below
 
02:17:52.509 --> 02:17:52.519 align:start position:0%
in is still below what you would have
 
02:17:55.709 --> 02:17:55.719 align:start position:0%
expected so there was no proper rebound
 
02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
uh it was worse in
 
02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
2020 but uh it uh early 2020 but uh it
 
02:18:05.910 --> 02:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
never really sort of we never catched up
 
02:18:10.349 --> 02:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:13.349 --> 02:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
cancers and here's just one graph of us
 
02:18:13.359 --> 02:18:14.270 align:start position:0%
cancers and here's just one graph of us
cancer

02:18:14.270 --> 02:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
mortality uh from 2010 to 2022 so we see
 
02:18:20.230 --> 02:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
there was like a lower downward Trend
 
02:18:23.389 --> 02:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
and then in 2020 sort of wasn't much
 
02:18:24.669 --> 02:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
difference from what you would expect
 
02:18:27.750 --> 02:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
but then in 2021 and 22 it's sort of
 
02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
going up uh so that downward trend has
 
02:18:32.990 --> 02:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
been broken and now is it then going up
 
02:18:35.150 --> 02:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
slightly and I would expect this to
 
02:18:38.549 --> 02:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
continue because most of these cancer
 
02:18:41.669 --> 02:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
cases that we missed the mortality is
 
02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
years in advance but uh not just you
 
02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't expect them to see only in a
 
02:18:47.669 --> 02:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
few years most of them will be much
 
02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
later that you see this excess excess
 
02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:51.990 align:start position:0%
later that you see this excess excess
death

02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
death
 
02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh here's an example of
 
02:18:57.870 --> 02:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
diabetes um so the Baseline is 100% And
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
then we see that it it in
 
02:19:01.599 --> 02:19:03.629 align:start position:0%
then we see that it it in
2020

02:19:03.629 --> 02:19:03.639 align:start position:0%
2020
 
02:19:03.639 --> 02:19:05.669 align:start position:0%
2020
the

02:19:05.669 --> 02:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:08.190 --> 02:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
uh the the diabetes test isort of going
 
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
down so we not getting proper care for
 
02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:11.190 align:start position:0%
down so we not getting proper care for
diabetes

02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
diabetes
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
patients uh vaccinations
 
02:19:16.190 --> 02:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
plummeted uh and childhood vaccinations
 
02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
are very important we're now seeing that
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
there like nil outbreaks which uh they
 
02:19:22.349 --> 02:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
has been before but they are more of
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
that than it used to be so uh we have
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
worldwide that uh there were less
 
02:19:33.030 --> 02:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and that was the dip it
 
02:19:34.990 --> 02:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
came back a little bit but it's not back
 
02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
to where it should be so that's another
 
02:19:40.110 --> 02:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
very problem from these lockdowns
 
02:19:43.629 --> 02:19:43.639 align:start position:0%
measures uh mental health
 
02:19:43.639 --> 02:19:46.349 align:start position:0%
measures uh mental health
uh

02:19:46.349 --> 02:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:49.349 --> 02:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh if you look at the the colum to the
 
02:19:51.070 --> 02:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
second to the right seriously considered
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
suicide in past 30 days
 
02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
among people aged 18 to 24 it was
 
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
25% in June of 2020 so there was there
 
02:20:03.070 --> 02:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
was enormous Med uh mental health
 
02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
consequences of uh of these
 
02:20:08.030 --> 02:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
lockdowns uh thank you for bringing that
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
up uh Dr kov um just a statement and a
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
question um because I just happened to
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
be on an intergovermental White House
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
call uh in the spring of 2020
 
02:20:23.790 --> 02:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
where they were already discussing the
 
02:20:26.230 --> 02:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
effects that the lockdowns were going to
 
02:20:31.349 --> 02:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
have uh with increased um suicides
 
02:20:34.349 --> 02:20:34.359 align:start position:0%
increased uh addiction rates and
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
um and having knowing that is there
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
anything I know you're you're talking
 
02:20:47.150 --> 02:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
about preventive measures but do you
 
02:20:48.469 --> 02:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
think it would have been the
 
02:20:51.630 --> 02:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the government
 
02:20:56.110 --> 02:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
as um at that time knowing that this was
 
02:20:59.790 --> 02:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
going to occur to try and offset how
 
02:21:02.389 --> 02:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
that would be and in in your
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
professional opinion I think you're
 
02:21:06.309 --> 02:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
talking to how some of that could have
 
02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
been averted but there is anything else
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
possibly and maybe you'll get to it
 
02:21:13.550 --> 02:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
later on in your presentation that we
 
02:21:17.150 --> 02:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
could have done um it was just I just
 
02:21:18.750 --> 02:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
happened to be on the call and to know
 
02:21:20.590 --> 02:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
that the White House at that time was
 
02:21:22.590 --> 02:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
already talking about this early on in
 
02:21:26.389 --> 02:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
the pandemic was really concerning to me
 
02:21:28.110 --> 02:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
yes you're right there was also a
 
02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
problem with like alcoholism and opio
 
02:21:36.110 --> 02:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
overdoses um and I think that the social
 
02:21:37.710 --> 02:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
support netor collapsed with the
 
02:21:40.670 --> 02:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
lockdowns people didn't go to meet their
 
02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
friends uh they didn't go to school or
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
universities they uh there was the
 
02:21:48.349 --> 02:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
religious Services was not available and
 
02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that's a big social
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
support network but also cultural
 
02:21:57.389 --> 02:21:57.399 align:start position:0%
activities where you meet meet people so
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
in all sectors of society there are
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
these social Gathering points that are
 
02:22:04.270 --> 02:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
not just for pleasure it's also for
 
02:22:08.389 --> 02:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
mental support so uh and I think mental
 
02:22:10.510 --> 02:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
health is is as serious as physical
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
health so I think both of them are
 
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
important uh this is actually from the
 
02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
UK but they did some U they looked at
 
02:22:21.790 --> 02:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
students uh preparing pre and during
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
pandemic so the stress level was uh both
 
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
were very similar for for uh uh men and
 
02:22:34.270 --> 02:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
women students but uh a little uh more
 
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
stress more sleep problems worse diet
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
and less physical activity so those are
 
02:22:47.510 --> 02:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
all basics for for uh General Health but
 
02:22:49.710 --> 02:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
also not only for General Health because
 
02:22:51.950 --> 02:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
we know exercise good diet is good to
 
02:22:53.630 --> 02:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
avoid cancer for example but it's also
 
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
good to fight infections so to being
 
02:22:57.469 --> 02:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
outside and exercising and eating
 
02:23:00.590 --> 02:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
healthy is actually good to uh be able
 
02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
to then deal with an infection whether
 
02:23:06.030 --> 02:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
else uh one of the most tragic I think
 
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
is uh is what happened in the developing
 
02:23:15.190 --> 02:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
world who sort of cop copied what the US
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
and Western Europe did and uh uh there
 
02:23:23.269 --> 02:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
were starvation and uh and malnutrition
 
02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
and for example in India the people the
 
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
poor people they live on the street they
 
02:23:28.750 --> 02:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
sell their they sell their food on the
 
02:23:30.590 --> 02:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
streets and then they make money and
 
02:23:32.830 --> 02:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
they buy for to sell the next day and
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
then they have a little bit to eat
 
02:23:36.670 --> 02:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
themselves that ended so you had all
 
02:23:38.190 --> 02:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
these very poor people who had to walk
 
02:23:41.110 --> 02:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
home several days to their Villages and
 
02:23:44.070 --> 02:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
some of them died on that track home so
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh and there were examples from Africa
 
02:23:49.710 --> 02:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
where where uh the markets closed and
 
02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
then the the families couldn't feed
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
their kids anymore so this is one of the
 
02:23:55.469 --> 02:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
most tragic
 
02:23:58.990 --> 02:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
things uh leaving Public Health we have
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
education which well education is also
 
02:24:02.670 --> 02:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
good important for for public health
 
02:24:04.750 --> 02:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
because we know that good education
 
02:24:07.150 --> 02:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
leads leads to healthier lives
 
02:24:10.110 --> 02:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
throughout throughout uh throughout life
 
02:24:12.269 --> 02:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
and we can see here that uh in this is
 
02:24:15.030 --> 02:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the mass course in there
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
were no testing in
 
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
2020 uh but the 2021 the math course
 
02:24:22.630 --> 02:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
were went way
 
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
down and it has recovered a little bit
 
02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
since then which is good uh very
 
02:24:29.269 --> 02:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
important but it's not back to what it
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
used to
 
02:24:35.150 --> 02:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
be uh the the English test scord they
 
02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
didn't decrease as much but we haven't
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
seen the rebound either so they also
 
02:24:43.790 --> 02:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:48.030 --> 02:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
be so let me compare then a little bit
 
02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
with Mo because most St B in the US had
 
02:24:54.349 --> 02:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
lockdowns to larger or smaller
 
02:24:58.429 --> 02:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
degrees and um the same in countries
 
02:25:00.670 --> 02:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
Canada had a very strong lockdowns and
 
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
most European countries so there were
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
sort of a few places that stood up one
 
02:25:07.469 --> 02:25:07.479 align:start position:0%
stood out one was Sweden they didn't
 
02:25:10.349 --> 02:25:10.359 align:start position:0%
close the schools for kids age 1 to 15
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
they didn't lock down businesses a
 
02:25:13.870 --> 02:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
restaurants so it was a fairly normal
 
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
life they did take measures to protect
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
older people a variety of measures but
 
02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
Sweden was heavily criticized
 
02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
2020 to uh uh because of U uh because of
 
02:25:29.349 --> 02:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh because they didn't do that and it
 
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
was also that they were going to a lot
 
02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
of people are going to kill and they
 
02:25:33.790 --> 02:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
would sometimes you would think there
 
02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
would be no seds left and I should say
 
02:25:38.190 --> 02:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
here that my native country is Sweden so
 
02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
I was following Sweden very
 
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
closely um I also participated in the
 
02:25:44.990 --> 02:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
discussions uh supporting the Swedish
 
02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
approach in that spring because I was
 
02:25:49.070 --> 02:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
afraid that they will Buckle under the
 
02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
international pressure
 
02:25:54.110 --> 02:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh Florida was an exception in the US in
 
02:25:55.710 --> 02:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
the spring of 2020 they did like
 
02:25:57.030 --> 02:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
everybody else they closed the schools
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
and stuff but then there was a shift uh
 
02:26:03.429 --> 02:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
I think in the summer of 2020 so they
 
02:26:06.269 --> 02:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
made sure the schools were opened and
 
02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
they tried to do Focus protection
 
02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
instead of Lock lockdowns and another
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
one was South Dakota I don't know how
 
02:26:13.630 --> 02:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
much Focus protection they did but they
 
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
didn't lock down
 
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
much um
 
02:26:21.070 --> 02:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
so we can then sort of see now
 
02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
it's four years later we can see what
 
02:26:23.439 --> 02:26:27.429 align:start position:0%
it's four years later we can see what
happens

02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
happened so first of all for spring of
 
02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
2020 when uh the 1.8 million children in
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
Sweden ages 1 to 15 they were all in
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
school no masks no social distancing in
 
02:26:41.910 --> 02:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
the classrooms If the child was sick
 
02:26:44.030 --> 02:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
they were told to stay home there were
 
02:26:46.830 --> 02:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
no testing for covid but if they were
 
02:26:49.950 --> 02:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
sick whether it was covid or whatever
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
they were told to stay home which I
 
02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
think is actually quite a good thing to
 
02:26:57.630 --> 02:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
to do um there were during the Spring
 
02:26:58.950 --> 02:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
there was Zero covid death among
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
children and only a few
 
02:27:03.190 --> 02:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations and teachers had the
 
02:27:06.550 --> 02:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
same Co risk as the average of other
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
professions uh so we knew and we knew
 
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
that the Swedish public health agency
 
02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
published a report in early July of 2020
 
02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
where they presented
 
02:27:19.710 --> 02:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
this uh so it was clear already then
 
02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:21.190 align:start position:0%
this uh so it was clear already then
that

02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:24.389 --> 02:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
keeping schools open was not dangerous
 
02:27:28.030 --> 02:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
at all there was no Co reason to do it
 
02:27:30.830 --> 02:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh and of course education is important
 
02:27:33.550 --> 02:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
for children uh Sweden did not have any
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
learning loss they had done this testing
 
02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
so unlike US states there was no
 
02:27:40.990 --> 02:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
Sweden uh if you compare excess
 
02:27:48.150 --> 02:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
death uh and covid death by country This
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
Is 2020 to 2022 of three
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
years um we can see
 
02:28:00.389 --> 02:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
that um Sweden it so the right side are
 
02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
the Coes the the red ones and you can
 
02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
see that Sweden is not the lowest but
 
02:28:08.710 --> 02:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
it's on the lower half of it it is lower
 
02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
than the
 
02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
average uh New Zealand is the the very
 
02:28:16.269 --> 02:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
lowest um because they really sort of
 
02:28:18.349 --> 02:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
contained it and they sort of not
 
02:28:19.870 --> 02:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
completely but they managed to keep keep
 
02:28:21.389 --> 02:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
it out out for a few
 
02:28:24.349 --> 02:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
years uh if we like look at access
 
02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
deaths so that is actually the more
 
02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
important measure because one thing you
 
02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
can covid death you can Define in
 
02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
different ways so there can be VAR with
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
that but a death is a death uh so
 
02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
countries can't really fetch the
 
02:28:40.190 --> 02:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
numbers um and also it's what's most
 
02:28:41.950 --> 02:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
important because it combines the
 
02:28:43.309 --> 02:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
mortality due
 
02:28:46.510 --> 02:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
to covid but also mortality due to for
 
02:28:48.070 --> 02:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
example cardiovascular disease because
 
02:28:49.469 --> 02:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
of the lockdown so it sort of gives the
 
02:28:50.710 --> 02:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
whole picture
 
02:28:52.429 --> 02:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
only for those three years so it doesn't
 
02:28:55.309 --> 02:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
count the cancer death that we'll
 
02:28:58.110 --> 02:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
have in the next few years but at least
 
02:29:00.190 --> 02:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
it does it for those three years and we
 
02:29:02.510 --> 02:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
can see that Sweden did is the lowest
 
02:29:05.429 --> 02:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
here uh Norway and Denmark were the
 
02:29:07.870 --> 02:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
second lowest and they also they did
 
02:29:09.630 --> 02:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
some school closings but they had took a
 
02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
lighter touch on the lockdowns than most
 
02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:12.230 align:start position:0%
lighter touch on the lockdowns than most
European

02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
European
 
02:29:15.309 --> 02:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
countries uh the US did not do so well
 
02:29:17.469 --> 02:29:17.479 align:start position:0%
uh neither in terms of covid nor in
 
02:29:22.910 --> 02:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:24.070 --> 02:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to look at the different
 
02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
states in the US and uh yeah go ahead
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
represent EV yeah thank you thank you
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
doctor so I just see this line here it
 
02:29:36.469 --> 02:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
says also for vaccines so I I don't know
 
02:29:39.150 --> 02:29:39.160 align:start position:0%
what that means but I was I was curious
 
02:29:42.510 --> 02:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
about the vaccine vaccination rates in
 
02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
the in these different countries and how
 
02:29:48.830 --> 02:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
you analyze that and that factors in
 
02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so Focus Focus protection is to
 
02:29:53.070 --> 02:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
protect the older people like nursing
 
02:29:55.230 --> 02:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
home and stuff but you also had Focus
 
02:29:58.110 --> 02:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
protections when the vaccine came so the
 
02:30:00.990 --> 02:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
question was who do you vaccinate first
 
02:30:03.830 --> 02:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
and Sweden was actually quite brutal
 
02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
they decided uh well healthcare workers
 
02:30:08.269 --> 02:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
should have it but then it was very
 
02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
strict by age so there was even a guy he
 
02:30:14.590 --> 02:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
was uh the administrator at some health
 
02:30:18.190 --> 02:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
care place and uh he didn't see patients
 
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
he decided to get it himself uh sort of
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
out of order because he wasn't that old
 
02:30:24.830 --> 02:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
but he was fired because he wasn't
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to get the vaccine that was
 
02:30:28.429 --> 02:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
needed for the older people so Sweden
 
02:30:29.910 --> 02:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
was very strict of having a very
 
02:30:31.790 --> 02:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
age-based high risk
 
02:30:35.670 --> 02:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
first um if uh and
 
02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh and that could be sort of ConEd to
 
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
CDC when they came out with a
 
02:30:42.389 --> 02:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation they they recommended
 
02:30:45.870 --> 02:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
healthcare worker which is good uh but
 
02:30:48.110 --> 02:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
they uh recommended
 
02:30:52.110 --> 02:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
certain uh uh sort of everyday workers
 
02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh to get as like store clerks and what
 
02:30:58.469 --> 02:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
they consider high-risk groups to get it
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
before the older people and I think that
 
02:31:01.550 --> 02:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
was a huge
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
mistake and Florida didn't follow it
 
02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
Florida followed re rejected CDC
 
02:31:08.469 --> 02:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
guidelines and just went with the age
 
02:31:10.309 --> 02:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
instead and then eventually Most states
 
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
actually sort of reversed it and they
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
went to more age-based
 
02:31:13.359 --> 02:31:14.870 align:start position:0%
went to more age-based
approach

02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
approach
 
02:31:18.830 --> 02:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
but uh I was sort of discouraged when I
 
02:31:22.510 --> 02:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
in in 202 21 early I saw like students
 
02:31:24.469 --> 02:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
bragging about oh I got the vaccine they
 
02:31:28.630 --> 02:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
were like 20 in their 20s and then my 87
 
02:31:31.070 --> 02:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
year old neighbor she hadn't gotten it
 
02:31:33.950 --> 02:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
yet so that wasn't right and they
 
02:31:36.790 --> 02:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
mandated vaccines for students and young
 
02:31:38.429 --> 02:31:38.439 align:start position:0%
people but there was no mandate for the
 
02:31:40.349 --> 02:31:40.359 align:start position:0%
retired people so there was a lot of old
 
02:31:42.190 --> 02:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
people in the US who didn't get the
 
02:31:44.910 --> 02:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine in a timely manner what a lot of
 
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
younger people did so Focus protection
 
02:31:48.590 --> 02:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
was also about the vaccines thank you
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
may may I just ask a quick question
 
02:31:53.469 --> 02:31:53.479 align:start position:0%
just us this will later when we're figur
 
02:31:57.070 --> 02:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
out um can you say which um vaccines
 
02:31:58.830 --> 02:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
were utilized in Sweden and also the
 
02:32:01.469 --> 02:32:01.479 align:start position:0%
other uh countries you listed as being
 
02:32:05.070 --> 02:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
low here uh so Sweden actually had a
 
02:32:07.230 --> 02:32:07.240 align:start position:0%
very high vaccination rate and they used
 
02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
fiser modna and astrazenica which is
 
02:32:12.950 --> 02:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
different from the US which used fiser
 
02:32:16.190 --> 02:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
modna and Johnson and Johnson astroica
 
02:32:18.830 --> 02:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
was not never approved in the
 
02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:21.349 align:start position:0%
was not never approved in the
US

02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
US
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
and that actually a good question
 
02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:32.469 --> 02:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
so uh but one reason that Sweden is very
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
very uh did well was because of this uh
 
02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and focusing on the older
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:43.319 --> 02:32:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
vaccinated

02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh so this is another exess death in
 
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
Europe uh where Sweden is the lowest now
 
02:32:56.830 --> 02:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
when we look at exess deaths you can
 
02:32:58.150 --> 02:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
calculate a little bit different ways
 
02:32:59.670 --> 02:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
what typically you do for Access death
 
02:33:02.830 --> 02:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
is you look at the total death in 2020
 
02:33:04.830 --> 02:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
and 22 and then you compare it what
 
02:33:08.349 --> 02:33:08.359 align:start position:0%
would it been if were the same rate in
 
02:33:10.670 --> 02:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
the prior three years like
 
02:33:15.150 --> 02:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
201 uh 17 18 and 19 but you can also
 
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
select a prior five years for example or
 
02:33:19.469 --> 02:33:19.479 align:start position:0%
you can start to put a little bit of a
 
02:33:21.670 --> 02:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
trend line so depending on what methods
 
02:33:24.590 --> 02:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
you use the exact numbers are going to
 
02:33:26.349 --> 02:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
vary a little bit and the exact order
 
02:33:27.910 --> 02:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
will vary a little bit but the basic
 
02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
picture is the same uh so I think
 
02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
there's some models you use Norway will
 
02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
actually be slightly better than Sweden
 
02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
so uh but this particular uh one Sweden
 
02:33:42.269 --> 02:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
was the lowest and Bulgaria was the
 
02:33:45.429 --> 02:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
worst uh UK is not and us are not in
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
this graph but UK had 10% and US
 
02:33:52.750 --> 02:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
14% so us was by far the worst but also
 
02:33:54.550 --> 02:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
by far the
 
02:33:58.349 --> 02:33:58.359 align:start position:0%
best uh I think repres thank you mam
 
02:34:01.950 --> 02:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
chair um back to the previous slide if I
 
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
may so that's the death rates um is the
 
02:34:10.230 --> 02:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates there as well so is
 
02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
the mortality rate so is there slides
 
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
later on to talk about the vaccination
 
02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
rate compared to the death rate I have
 
02:34:19.150 --> 02:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
no slide for that now you don't thank I
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
could talk about about vaccines because
 
02:34:24.110 --> 02:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
they work with vaccines but I haven't uh
 
02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
I have I I I think that that wasn't my
 
02:34:29.670 --> 02:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
request to do that
 
02:34:32.910 --> 02:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
so uh this is just all cost morality in
 
02:34:34.990 --> 02:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
Sweden through many years and you can
 
02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:35.870 align:start position:0%
Sweden through many years and you can
see

02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:38.070 align:start position:0%
see
that

02:34:38.070 --> 02:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:34:42.110 --> 02:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
um it would have been going down 2018
 
02:34:44.750 --> 02:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
and 19 That season was very low 201920
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
it went a little bit up and then it went
 
02:34:48.750 --> 02:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
down but there's not a major excess here
 
02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
and ter of all cross morality for Sweden
 
02:34:52.469 --> 02:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh now when we do all excess
 
02:35:00.830 --> 02:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
death we compare some years now between
 
02:35:02.590 --> 02:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
previous years so it's not critical to
 
02:35:04.429 --> 02:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
adjust for age you can do it but it has
 
02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
minimal effect because you actually
 
02:35:07.710 --> 02:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
comparing a very similar H distribution
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
in one country to like a few years below
 
02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
before but if you compare covid rates
 
02:35:14.630 --> 02:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
you should have you have to adjust for
 
02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:15.469 align:start position:0%
you should have you have to adjust for
for

02:35:15.469 --> 02:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:35:18.830 --> 02:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
mortality uh Maine is the oldest state
 
02:35:20.190 --> 02:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
has the oldest population in the US so
 
02:35:24.349 --> 02:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
obviously that's because people are
 
02:35:27.150 --> 02:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
older they will die more that's an
 
02:35:29.070 --> 02:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunate fact of
 
02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
life uh so if you compare cancer rates
 
02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
for example you always adjust for age no
 
02:35:39.230 --> 02:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
sane epiology would ever compare cancer
 
02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
rat without adjusting for
 
02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
AG with Co you also have to adjust for
 
02:35:46.110 --> 02:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
age because Co is much more common in
 
02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:46.950 align:start position:0%
age because Co is much more common in
older

02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
older
 
02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
people and we don't want to know that if
 
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
you compare Maine and New Hampshire well
 
02:35:54.429 --> 02:35:54.439 align:start position:0%
if there are more cases in Co in Maine
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
than in New Hampshire maybe that's
 
02:35:58.230 --> 02:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
because they're older that's not what we
 
02:35:59.830 --> 02:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
want to compare we want to adjust it for
 
02:36:02.790 --> 02:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
the age so it's very important to adjust
 
02:36:05.710 --> 02:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
for age in Co that wasn't always done so
 
02:36:07.870 --> 02:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
when you when you see comparison of Co
 
02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
Race by state for example you have to
 
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're age adjusted I
 
02:36:13.469 --> 02:36:13.479 align:start position:0%
just going to give an example so I'm
 
02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
going into a little bit of mathematics
 
02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
here uh so uh if you look at crude
 
02:36:20.790 --> 02:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
annual mortality race comparing Nigeria
 
02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:21.790 align:start position:0%
annual mortality race comparing Nigeria
with

02:36:21.790 --> 02:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
Japan and we all know that Japan is a
 
02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
very wealthy country and Nigeria less so
 
02:36:29.469 --> 02:36:29.479 align:start position:0%
so you would expect that people died
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
more in Nigeria than in Japan but if you
 
02:36:33.630 --> 02:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
look at the just the crude annual
 
02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:34.710 align:start position:0%
look at the just the crude annual
mortality

02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
mortality
 
02:36:36.590 --> 02:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
rates actually there are more people
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
dying in Japan than Nigeria why is that
 
02:36:43.070 --> 02:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh represent mer thank you madam chair
 
02:36:44.590 --> 02:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
this is interesting
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
because some data I saw looking at State
 
02:36:50.309 --> 02:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
comparisons between new h and other
 
02:36:52.269 --> 02:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
states New Hampshire actually ranked
 
02:36:54.590 --> 02:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
probably second from the bottom as far
 
02:36:58.469 --> 02:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
as death rates so using the analogy
 
02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here given the fact
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is probably be the second
 
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
oldest state in the country and they had
 
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
the lowest death rate would that not be
 
02:37:08.110 --> 02:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
something it doesn't jive and trying to
 
02:37:10.309 --> 02:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
get to is you expect New Hampshire with
 
02:37:12.910 --> 02:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
a higher elderly population would have a
 
02:37:15.750 --> 02:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
higher crude mortality rate in reality
 
02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
in covid we actually had less yep that's
 
02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:20.269 align:start position:0%
in covid we actually had less yep that's
true

02:37:20.269 --> 02:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
true
 
02:37:23.870 --> 02:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire did well thank you and
 
02:37:25.269 --> 02:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
Maine did well
 
02:37:27.630 --> 02:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
too thank
 
02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
you uh so the thing is the age
 
02:37:31.990 --> 02:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
distribution so Nigeria has a very young
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
population and young people don't die
 
02:37:37.630 --> 02:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
Japan has a very old uh population and
 
02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
old people tend to die so if we compare
 
02:37:43.070 --> 02:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
every age group in every age group
 
02:37:45.190 --> 02:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
mortality is higher in Nigeria among
 
02:37:51.110 --> 02:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
kids 25 versus 6 among children 5 15 2.1
 
02:37:55.349 --> 02:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
versus 0.1 among people over 70 55
 
02:37:59.309 --> 02:37:59.319 align:start position:0%
versus 44 so in every age group Japanese
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
people are less likely to die but if you
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
add them up without adjusting for age
 
02:38:06.830 --> 02:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
Nigeria comes out looking great so it is
 
02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
important always when you look at this
 
02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
Co rates or cancer rates to always
 
02:38:14.230 --> 02:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
adjust for age and in the US actually
 
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
there's quite big difference in average
 
02:38:19.550 --> 02:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
age it's I think between Maine and Texas
 
02:38:21.429 --> 02:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
the the average age is 10 year
 
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
difference and that's quite a bit if it
 
02:38:25.429 --> 02:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
was only one year it wouldn't make much
 
02:38:28.389 --> 02:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
difference but it is quite a lot I'm
 
02:38:30.870 --> 02:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
going to skip that one so here's the co
 
02:38:32.750 --> 02:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
mortality between the 12 largest states
 
02:38:34.469 --> 02:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
in the country so we know Texas didn't
 
02:38:35.590 --> 02:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
do very
 
02:38:39.230 --> 02:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
well uh uh Ohio Georgia a little bit
 
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
better but not so much Michigan and
 
02:38:44.630 --> 02:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania close to the national
 
02:38:47.269 --> 02:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
average uh the best of these 12 states
 
02:38:49.670 --> 02:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
were Florida and Virginia and uh and
 
02:38:52.349 --> 02:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
also California California was the heavy
 
02:38:54.550 --> 02:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
lockdown state Florida was the least one
 
02:38:56.230 --> 02:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
of the least lockdown
 
02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
States so uh clearly when Flor didn't Lo
 
02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
down there's no evidence here that that
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
made it bad in Florida Florida came out
 
02:39:10.469 --> 02:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
very well looking at these states now
 
02:39:11.870 --> 02:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
there are many other factors other than
 
02:39:13.870 --> 02:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
lockdowns and focus protected they play
 
02:39:16.429 --> 02:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
a role here but at least we can sort of
 
02:39:18.630 --> 02:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
say that Florida ended up really really
 
02:39:20.070 --> 02:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
bad because they didn't lock down they
 
02:39:21.990 --> 02:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
did quite
 
02:39:25.710 --> 02:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
well uh if you compare the Dakotas South
 
02:39:27.990 --> 02:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
Dakota didn't lock down North Dakota did
 
02:39:30.510 --> 02:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
South Dakota plus three North Dakota
 
02:39:32.110 --> 02:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
minus 2 they are basically all very
 
02:39:34.150 --> 02:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
close to the national average not a not
 
02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
a big
 
02:39:39.790 --> 02:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
difference and I think that's sort of uh
 
02:39:43.950 --> 02:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
the message here lockdown doesn't help
 
02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
when it comes to covid it doesn't harm
 
02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to covid mortality either
 
02:39:50.510 --> 02:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a wash
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh it does harm when it comes to
 
02:39:54.670 --> 02:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
Collateral Damage the
 
02:39:57.790 --> 02:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
lockdowns uh thank you represent gr go
 
02:40:00.870 --> 02:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you you're really only
 
02:40:03.150 --> 02:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
basing that comment on that one data
 
02:40:05.710 --> 02:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
point so what other things that could
 
02:40:07.349 --> 02:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
have interplayed with that to affect
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
that because that's not really I can
 
02:40:10.469 --> 02:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
understand why you're saying that if
 
02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
lockdown were the only issue but were
 
02:40:14.389 --> 02:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
there other things that those states
 
02:40:17.309 --> 02:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
were doing at the same time that could
 
02:40:20.230 --> 02:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
have that's doesn't really to me
 
02:40:22.830 --> 02:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
comparing one data point and using that
 
02:40:24.590 --> 02:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
as a basis doesn't
 
02:40:27.389 --> 02:40:27.399 align:start position:0%
really Jive you know what I mean yeah so
 
02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
there could be you're right there could
 
02:40:32.429 --> 02:40:32.439 align:start position:0%
be very other things so maybe uh nor
 
02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
maybe South Dakota did something else
 
02:40:36.030 --> 02:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
that really lowered the maybe they have
 
02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
better Healthcare or something like that
 
02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
so my only Point here is that looking at
 
02:40:43.269 --> 02:40:43.279 align:start position:0%
this data where there a lot of factors
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
influencing it there's no evidence that
 
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
the the states who didn't lock down that
 
02:40:49.630 --> 02:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
they did any worse than others when it
 
02:40:53.309 --> 02:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
comes to co mortality uh represent Penza
 
02:40:56.790 --> 02:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm very familiar with um so it
 
02:40:59.630 --> 02:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
was early on in in 2020 um when the
 
02:41:02.550 --> 02:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
schools closed down U and I watched very
 
02:41:05.349 --> 02:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
closely about what happened in Sweden um
 
02:41:07.870 --> 02:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
shared that a lot of that information I
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
I can grab old emails I'm sure so I
 
02:41:12.150 --> 02:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
think that the most significant thing
 
02:41:14.590 --> 02:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
and I don't know where that slide is um
 
02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
is specifically about the schools
 
02:41:20.150 --> 02:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
because that is um you know kind of
 
02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
comparing Apples to Apples ones that you
 
02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
know without having masks and all that
 
02:41:26.750 --> 02:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
if you're you know if you're sick stay
 
02:41:29.230 --> 02:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
home so could you focus on that just for
 
02:41:32.469 --> 02:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
a little bit um you know in comparing
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
that maybe to someone else that did all
 
02:41:37.870 --> 02:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:40.469 --> 02:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
things yeah so I think there's also been
 
02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
studies showing that there's no evidence
 
02:41:44.950 --> 02:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
that closing schools reduced
 
02:41:47.670 --> 02:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
Transmission in the general general
 
02:41:49.790 --> 02:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
population and
 
02:41:52.590 --> 02:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
that's different from in many ways Co is
 
02:41:55.070 --> 02:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
similar to influenza but that's actually
 
02:41:57.110 --> 02:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
one where it's different from influenza
 
02:41:57.120 --> 02:41:58.110 align:start position:0%
one where it's different from influenza
because

02:41:58.110 --> 02:41:58.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:42:01.309 --> 02:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
influenza kids are super
 
02:42:03.429 --> 02:42:03.439 align:start position:0%
spreaders if if you have kids you
 
02:42:04.990 --> 02:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
probably know that they are good as
 
02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:05.950 align:start position:0%
probably know that they are good as
spreading

02:42:05.950 --> 02:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
spreading
 
02:42:09.070 --> 02:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
viruses uh so for
 
02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:11.230 align:start position:0%
viruses uh so for
influenza

02:42:11.230 --> 02:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
influenza
 
02:42:14.150 --> 02:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh they are super spreaders so if so for
 
02:42:16.590 --> 02:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
example vaccinating kids will sort of
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
reduce that spread in the through the
 
02:42:21.030 --> 02:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
school so schools are sort of a super SP
 
02:42:22.630 --> 02:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
for K that was not the case there was
 
02:42:24.349 --> 02:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
early on there was a study from Iceland
 
02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
that showed that um uh and and they have
 
02:42:30.349 --> 02:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
a small sort of population and they can
 
02:42:31.950 --> 02:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
look at the genetics of the virus so
 
02:42:34.230 --> 02:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
they can kind of figure out who infected
 
02:42:37.230 --> 02:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
who and they found that adults will
 
02:42:39.990 --> 02:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
often infect kids but kids will very
 
02:42:43.150 --> 02:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
rarely infect adults so that's something
 
02:42:46.150 --> 02:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
we knew in 2020 so that sort of goes
 
02:42:48.269 --> 02:42:48.279 align:start position:0%
together I I presented the Swedish data
 
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
that none of the Went to went to U uh
 
02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
die from covid and very few station and
 
02:42:55.990 --> 02:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
the teachers had the same risk as the
 
02:42:57.150 --> 02:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
average of other professions so that's
 
02:42:58.830 --> 02:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
sort of epidemiological
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
data um the I that sort of combines with
 
02:43:04.630 --> 02:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
the Iceland data that sort of explains
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
what we saw in Sweden so those are
 
02:43:08.830 --> 02:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
different different types of of
 
02:43:10.630 --> 02:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
information we have but they sort of
 
02:43:13.469 --> 02:43:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
other presentative belter thank you
 
02:43:17.630 --> 02:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh and this is really good
 
02:43:19.389 --> 02:43:19.399 align:start position:0%
information um one thing i' I'd like to
 
02:43:22.870 --> 02:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
get into just to make sure I have the
 
02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
correct idea of what's going on
 
02:43:26.590 --> 02:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
regarding what we're looking at as far
 
02:43:28.590 --> 02:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
as these mortality
 
02:43:30.349 --> 02:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
statistics one of the things I think
 
02:43:31.469 --> 02:43:31.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking at as a
 
02:43:33.910 --> 02:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
committee um I have a lot of personal
 
02:43:38.790 --> 02:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
interest in um is the uh the sort of
 
02:43:42.110 --> 02:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
differences we see between um mortality
 
02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
caused by covid versus all cause
 
02:43:47.389 --> 02:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
mortality and one of the things that I'm
 
02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
I have some concern about and I'm
 
02:43:50.469 --> 02:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
certainly open to the possibility that
 
02:43:53.269 --> 02:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but I have seen that there
 
02:43:58.550 --> 02:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
were um more than one possible Financial
 
02:44:00.990 --> 02:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
incentives that could have I'm not
 
02:44:02.269 --> 02:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
saying they definitely did but they
 
02:44:05.710 --> 02:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
could have contributed to over diagnosis
 
02:44:09.630 --> 02:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
of covid and or over listing of covid
 
02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
deaths um so looking at this is this
 
02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
data we're seeing right now this is
 
02:44:18.150 --> 02:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
based on those who were listed as covid
 
02:44:21.630 --> 02:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
deaths and does that sort of jive with
 
02:44:26.349 --> 02:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
the overall context of um all cause
 
02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
time your speaker please sorry thank you
 
02:44:38.830 --> 02:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
all cost mortality is easy because
 
02:44:41.790 --> 02:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
people are dead or not uh uh Co
 
02:44:43.990 --> 02:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
mortality is defined different in
 
02:44:45.349 --> 02:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
different places so for example in the
 
02:44:46.750 --> 02:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
European countries they are different
 
02:44:48.990 --> 02:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
definitions of it so you can't complete
 
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
complely compare those
 
02:44:54.790 --> 02:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
numbers uh in the US there could also be
 
02:44:54.800 --> 02:44:55.830 align:start position:0%
numbers uh in the US there could also be
Regional

02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
Regional
 
02:44:59.269 --> 02:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
differences but we know that
 
02:45:01.349 --> 02:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh there has been sort of studies where
 
02:45:03.190 --> 02:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
you look at the actual medical records
 
02:45:05.790 --> 02:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
of people so we know that some people
 
02:45:06.950 --> 02:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
there sort of three groups there are
 
02:45:08.990 --> 02:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
those who died because of co co was the
 
02:45:11.349 --> 02:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
underlaying cause of death there's also
 
02:45:14.349 --> 02:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
those who where was a contributing cost
 
02:45:16.870 --> 02:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
they might be sick for other reasons but
 
02:45:19.750 --> 02:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
then K was sort of contributing as
 
02:45:21.630 --> 02:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
together with these other ones and thr
 
02:45:24.910 --> 02:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
tip to balance and then there are those
 
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
where it was not Rel to covid uh there
 
02:45:30.469 --> 02:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
are examples of people who maybe died in
 
02:45:32.349 --> 02:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
the car accident but they had tested
 
02:45:34.990 --> 02:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
positive for covid a week before and
 
02:45:37.269 --> 02:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
they classified as a covid death so they
 
02:45:38.710 --> 02:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
all these three
 
02:45:41.830 --> 02:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
groups uh so that makes covid mortality
 
02:45:45.070 --> 02:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
sort of a little bit fussy so I don't
 
02:45:47.070 --> 02:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
know if South Dakota North Dakota had
 
02:45:48.510 --> 02:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
different definition I would expect them
 
02:45:50.230 --> 02:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
to be very similar but I don't know for
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
sure so that's one possible explanation
 
02:45:54.950 --> 02:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
for for these and you're also right
 
02:45:56.309 --> 02:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
there was sort of incentives for
 
02:45:58.910 --> 02:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
Hospital there were there were Financial
 
02:46:00.750 --> 02:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
incentives both in the US as well as in
 
02:46:03.389 --> 02:46:03.399 align:start position:0%
some countries in Europe of of
 
02:46:05.349 --> 02:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
diagnosing a covid death either because
 
02:46:07.429 --> 02:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
the hospitals got extra sort of bonus
 
02:46:09.349 --> 02:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
pays there was
 
02:46:13.110 --> 02:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
also funeral uh expenses that states
 
02:46:16.150 --> 02:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
were giving to families if it was a if
 
02:46:18.030 --> 02:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
was a covid death so that sort of gave
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
an incentives to to to make it
 
02:46:23.070 --> 02:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
covid um and most people wouldn't likee
 
02:46:25.790 --> 02:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
completely but if Co was sort of maybe
 
02:46:30.630 --> 02:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:32.630 --> 02:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
balance yeah there a lot of intri
 
02:46:34.710 --> 02:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
intricacies between these data so it's
 
02:46:37.670 --> 02:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
really good that you are sort of on top
 
02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:39.030 align:start position:0%
really good that you are sort of on top
of

02:46:39.030 --> 02:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:46:41.630 --> 02:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
that uh so here's the good news Co
 
02:46:43.830 --> 02:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
mortality in New England was quite
 
02:46:46.950 --> 02:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
good uh all the New England states were
 
02:46:49.150 --> 02:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
below average and New Hampshire was way
 
02:46:52.990 --> 02:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.429 align:start position:0%
 
average

02:46:55.429 --> 02:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
average
 
02:46:58.269 --> 02:46:58.279 align:start position:0%
uh and here I want to illustrate and
 
02:46:59.510 --> 02:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a little bit hard to see
 
02:47:01.550 --> 02:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
I illustrate the importance of age
 
02:47:03.309 --> 02:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
adjustments so in the left is the raw
 
02:47:05.830 --> 02:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
rates on the right or the age adjusted
 
02:47:08.190 --> 02:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
rate so you see Texas for example the
 
02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
raw rate is about the national
 
02:47:14.590 --> 02:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
average but if you age adjust is one of
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
the worst one of the five worst because
 
02:47:20.389 --> 02:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
Texas is a very young population you can
 
02:47:21.870 --> 02:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
compare that with Pennsylvania which has
 
02:47:23.550 --> 02:47:23.560 align:start position:0%
a fairly old
 
02:47:27.070 --> 02:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
population uh the raw rate is 17% above
 
02:47:30.349 --> 02:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
the national average but uh the age
 
02:47:33.429 --> 02:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
adjusted is 2% so the one to the right
 
02:47:35.309 --> 02:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
here so are the correct numbers and you
 
02:47:39.469 --> 02:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
can see how it can sort of shift up or
 
02:47:41.190 --> 02:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
down quite a
 
02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:43.110 align:start position:0%
down quite a
lot

02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
lot
 
02:47:48.110 --> 02:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire is minus 35 in the Raw
 
02:47:52.230 --> 02:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
rates but then if you adjust for age
 
02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's minus 41 so that's because New
 
02:47:57.269 --> 02:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has an older population than
 
02:47:58.910 --> 02:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
the US average therefore it sort of
 
02:48:00.950 --> 02:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
looks better when you age adjust so for
 
02:48:02.429 --> 02:48:02.439 align:start position:0%
some states it goes down and for some
 
02:48:05.389 --> 02:48:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:08.710 --> 02:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
up and this is excess mortality by state
 
02:48:11.510 --> 02:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
and age so to the left we have excess
 
02:48:16.309 --> 02:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
mortality in 2022 23 and the winner
 
02:48:21.349 --> 02:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:26.309 --> 02:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:30.349 --> 02:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the worst one
 
02:48:34.630 --> 02:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
is Arizona and I'm sorry that this is so
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
small uh Arizona was the
 
02:48:41.550 --> 02:48:41.560 align:start position:0%
worst uh so to the left is all
 
02:48:45.070 --> 02:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
ages uh the second panel is 65 plus then
 
02:48:48.269 --> 02:48:48.279 align:start position:0%
it's 45 to 64 and the right one is 15 to
 
02:48:48.279 --> 02:48:50.110 align:start position:0%
it's 45 to 64 and the right one is 15 to
44

02:48:50.110 --> 02:48:50.120 align:start position:0%
44
 
02:48:54.070 --> 02:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
and we can the the green is Florida the
 
02:48:55.990 --> 02:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
which was sort of a non- lockdown State
 
02:48:58.230 --> 02:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
the orange or the yellow is California
 
02:49:00.830 --> 02:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
which was a very harsh lockdown state
 
02:49:02.309 --> 02:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
they're sort of similar in the sense
 
02:49:05.230 --> 02:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
they have both a warm nice climate and
 
02:49:08.389 --> 02:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
we can see that uh California did not do
 
02:49:09.950 --> 02:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
well and especially among the younger
 
02:49:11.230 --> 02:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
people it didn't do
 
02:49:15.190 --> 02:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
well um and I think lockdown sort of
 
02:49:16.870 --> 02:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
affect younger people quite a bit I
 
02:49:19.630 --> 02:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
think Florida did very well for the
 
02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
young people for the older people not
 
02:49:23.309 --> 02:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
quite as
 
02:49:25.950 --> 02:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
good representative Belcher thank you if
 
02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
I may and I I I want to make sure I
 
02:49:31.110 --> 02:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
really have this concept perfectly
 
02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
distilled so looking at this from a we
 
02:49:35.269 --> 02:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
understand that there's there's
 
02:49:36.790 --> 02:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
confounding variables in this that do
 
02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
make things very
 
02:49:42.389 --> 02:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
difficult but what we're seeing
 
02:49:45.110 --> 02:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
consistently is not really any
 
02:49:46.910 --> 02:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
particular correlation between those
 
02:49:48.950 --> 02:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
with harsher lockdown measures versus is
 
02:49:51.389 --> 02:49:51.399 align:start position:0%
those with not now correlation of course
 
02:49:55.550 --> 02:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
does not equal causation but if we were
 
02:49:58.349 --> 02:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
to if we were to start out with the
 
02:50:00.349 --> 02:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
assumption that lockdowns do some good
 
02:50:02.630 --> 02:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
we should at least see some correlation
 
02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
right I think so exactly thank you so
 
02:50:09.030 --> 02:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not claiming that uh
 
02:50:11.469 --> 02:50:11.479 align:start position:0%
lockdown generated more
 
02:50:13.830 --> 02:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
Co but there's no evidence that it
 
02:50:15.870 --> 02:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
generated any less
 
02:50:18.349 --> 02:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
Co representative Penza representa
 
02:50:22.269 --> 02:50:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:25.830 --> 02:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
BR so um from the stats that you have
 
02:50:29.150 --> 02:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire at one point in time
 
02:50:31.349 --> 02:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire had it was published in
 
02:50:34.950 --> 02:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
the paper um the the highest percentage
 
02:50:38.110 --> 02:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
of mortality in the country for our
 
02:50:42.910 --> 02:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
elderly um for Co or correct okay so um
 
02:50:45.229 --> 02:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
that's by like if you're you know per
 
02:50:47.750 --> 02:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
capita like so not just in a general
 
02:50:49.510 --> 02:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
number sense because of course you know
 
02:50:52.590 --> 02:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
our state is 1.4 million compared to you
 
02:50:54.990 --> 02:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
know if you've got New York it's Sho so
 
02:50:58.190 --> 02:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to kind of understand
 
02:51:02.429 --> 02:51:02.439 align:start position:0%
um based upon the elderly did you see is
 
02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
that is that age in there do you have
 
02:51:07.910 --> 02:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
that data so the second panel is uh the
 
02:51:10.830 --> 02:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
old people I know I can't see it so New
 
02:51:13.550 --> 02:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is number five the fifth best
 
02:51:16.110 --> 02:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
the win of all people was Rhode Island
 
02:51:19.070 --> 02:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
okay and I'm sorry that this is so uh
 
02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:20.389 align:start position:0%
okay and I'm sorry that this is so uh
so

02:51:20.389 --> 02:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:51:23.070 --> 02:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
small but but one thing is important to
 
02:51:26.550 --> 02:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
realize that the temporal Trends are
 
02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
different to different places so it
 
02:51:30.349 --> 02:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
could so there were a time for example
 
02:51:31.910 --> 02:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
where Michigan was the highest in the
 
02:51:34.510 --> 02:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
country that doesn't mean that they did
 
02:51:37.469 --> 02:51:37.479 align:start position:0%
something bad because necessarily
 
02:51:38.910 --> 02:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
because it was just at that point in
 
02:51:41.469 --> 02:51:41.479 align:start position:0%
time right that's what I'm thinking so I
 
02:51:43.309 --> 02:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
I I jumped over this graph so this is
 
02:51:45.550 --> 02:51:45.560 align:start position:0%
Florida so you can see that seasonal the
 
02:51:48.950 --> 02:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
seasonal mortality in Florida correct um
 
02:51:50.990 --> 02:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
and there are two peaks in Florida there
 
02:51:54.030 --> 02:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
is the summer Peak and the winter
 
02:51:56.550 --> 02:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
Peak but New England doesn't have two
 
02:51:58.510 --> 02:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
peaks has only one Peak winter Peak is
 
02:52:00.229 --> 02:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
low in the summer so the southern parts
 
02:52:02.309 --> 02:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
of the United States have sort of a two
 
02:52:05.550 --> 02:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
peak summer Peak winter Peak and the uh
 
02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
the north has only a winter Peak okay if
 
02:52:09.790 --> 02:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
you go to the summer hemisphere is they
 
02:52:12.110 --> 02:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
have like a peak in their winter which
 
02:52:13.590 --> 02:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
is our
 
02:52:16.309 --> 02:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
summer represent Merchant yeah so
 
02:52:19.389 --> 02:52:19.399 align:start position:0%
actually if you the gray ones are are
 
02:52:23.070 --> 02:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
the uh are the all the other states and
 
02:52:27.550 --> 02:52:27.560 align:start position:0%
if you look on May uh May 2021 sort of
 
02:52:29.309 --> 02:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
in the middle you can see there's one
 
02:52:32.190 --> 02:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
state that stands out that's
 
02:52:35.990 --> 02:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
Michigan you were had in in in uh in
 
02:52:39.030 --> 02:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
late spring of 2021 Michigan was way
 
02:52:40.590 --> 02:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
high higher than everybody
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
else but the thing with uh thing like Co
 
02:52:49.110 --> 02:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
you have to go through it you can't
 
02:52:51.910 --> 02:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
prevent it it's it's going to go through
 
02:52:55.269 --> 02:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
you can postpone it with some measures
 
02:52:56.830 --> 02:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
but you're going to have to live through
 
02:52:59.030 --> 02:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
it it's going to it's just going to go
 
02:53:01.510 --> 02:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
through and you have to just have to as
 
02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
it goes through you have to protect
 
02:53:04.229 --> 02:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
those that are at highest risk but if
 
02:53:06.670 --> 02:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
you if you keep it out completely it's
 
02:53:08.030 --> 02:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
going to come again that's what happened
 
02:53:09.910 --> 02:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
in Australia for example they they able
 
02:53:12.110 --> 02:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
to successfully to suppress it for a
 
02:53:17.990 --> 02:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
while but then it came yeah so yeah RS
 
02:53:19.269 --> 02:53:19.279 align:start position:0%
and Merchant
 
02:53:21.269 --> 02:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
02:53:23.710 --> 02:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
taking the question if you go back to
 
02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
the slide which very curious again this
 
02:53:29.269 --> 02:53:29.279 align:start position:0%
is dealing with the death rates this one
 
02:53:32.190 --> 02:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
or this one please thank you that's
 
02:53:36.030 --> 02:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with mortality the death rate so
 
02:53:37.710 --> 02:53:37.720 align:start position:0%
what I don't see here like the other
 
02:53:39.389 --> 02:53:39.399 align:start position:0%
slide we're looking only at the death
 
02:53:41.950 --> 02:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
rate but we don't have a comparison to
 
02:53:43.910 --> 02:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
the states that had high vaccine rates
 
02:53:45.229 --> 02:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get to is the vaccination
 
02:53:46.710 --> 02:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
rate because if I understood what you
 
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
said in Sweden Sweden had had a
 
02:53:51.070 --> 02:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
relatively High vaccination rate but had
 
02:53:54.429 --> 02:53:54.439 align:start position:0%
a relatively low death rate but in these
 
02:53:55.870 --> 02:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
slides here I don't see the same
 
02:53:57.750 --> 02:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
corresponded or a correlation between
 
02:54:00.309 --> 02:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
the vaccination versus death rate yeah
 
02:54:03.150 --> 02:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I mean there are those slides
 
02:54:06.429 --> 02:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
okay uh I don't
 
02:54:08.830 --> 02:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
uh after this presentation I'm going to
 
02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
dig out a slide from Sweden that shows
 
02:54:13.550 --> 02:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
very interesting with vaccinations but
 
02:54:16.469 --> 02:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
the key thing is also that it's not
 
02:54:19.550 --> 02:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate as a whole as important
 
02:54:21.429 --> 02:54:21.439 align:start position:0%
it's the vaccination among the elderly
 
02:54:23.469 --> 02:54:23.479 align:start position:0%
that's important that's the that's what
 
02:54:26.750 --> 02:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
actually affects the the mortality rates
 
02:54:27.990 --> 02:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
and that's thank you because that's what
 
02:54:29.510 --> 02:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get to is in New Hampshire
 
02:54:32.389 --> 02:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
like I said before we have relatively
 
02:54:35.670 --> 02:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
High population elderly wise our age
 
02:54:37.150 --> 02:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
average age is relatively high in the
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
country and I think we did a fairly good
 
02:54:41.309 --> 02:54:41.319 align:start position:0%
job trying to get to is the elderly
 
02:54:42.630 --> 02:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
getting vaccinated and that's why I'm
 
02:54:44.710 --> 02:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
trying to get the correlation between
 
02:54:46.550 --> 02:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
what the state did as far as that
 
02:54:48.110 --> 02:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
population versus maybe what some other
 
02:54:50.190 --> 02:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
stat didn't do I'm going to go to
 
02:54:52.429 --> 02:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
another slide I didn't include it I
 
02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
should have but uh let me go to another
 
02:54:59.309 --> 02:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
slide Madam chair I'm going to yield my
 
02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
question to representative cre uh crean
 
02:55:04.469 --> 02:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
over here thank you
 
02:55:07.830 --> 02:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
sure and and Dr cof if that's not
 
02:55:09.469 --> 02:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
something you have right off that
 
02:55:11.750 --> 02:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
something maybe you could send to us
 
02:55:13.830 --> 02:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
 
02:55:16.910 --> 02:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
chair I do have it somewhere here so let
 
02:55:19.429 --> 02:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
me ask
 
02:55:31.670 --> 02:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:34.190 --> 02:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
it Madam chair if I could just make a
 
02:55:35.950 --> 02:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
comment well I think that's going to be
 
02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
one of the struggles for us because we
 
02:55:40.190 --> 02:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
have experts in particular areas and
 
02:55:41.630 --> 02:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to put it all
 
02:55:44.309 --> 02:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
together because it's hard to view any
 
02:55:48.429 --> 02:55:48.439 align:start position:0%
individual thing in isolation this whole
 
02:55:51.389 --> 02:55:51.399 align:start position:0%
issue of correlation is not
 
02:55:55.110 --> 02:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
causation I understand uh so this is a
 
02:55:59.110 --> 02:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
slide from Sweden uh and this is from
 
02:56:01.990 --> 02:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
the winter of 2020 21 so this was sort
 
02:56:04.710 --> 02:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
of the first season where we had access
 
02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:06.030 align:start position:0%
of the first season where we had access
to

02:56:06.030 --> 02:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:56:11.550 --> 02:56:11.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines and on the top is uh cases of
 
02:56:15.349 --> 02:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
covid by time so you can see that uh
 
02:56:19.349 --> 02:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
there's two peaks of Co circulation
 
02:56:22.349 --> 02:56:22.359 align:start position:0%
one sort of peaked in around December
 
02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
and then there was a second Peak around
 
02:56:29.790 --> 02:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
April May so this is how the this is how
 
02:56:32.389 --> 02:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
the virus was circulating so this is all
 
02:56:33.670 --> 02:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
cases all
 
02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
ages the first red uh vertical line is
 
02:56:40.710 --> 02:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
the start of the vaccination
 
02:56:45.030 --> 02:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
campaign so during this uh first Peak
 
02:56:47.110 --> 02:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
That season this was the second Peak
 
02:56:49.269 --> 02:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
because there was one Peak in the spring
 
02:56:51.389 --> 02:56:51.399 align:start position:0%
of 2020 then the summer came and went
 
02:56:55.150 --> 02:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
down and then so during that Peak uh the
 
02:56:56.990 --> 02:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination only started at sort of at
 
02:56:58.990 --> 02:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
the end of it and it takes some time for
 
02:57:00.510 --> 02:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
the vaccines to get effect and you have
 
02:57:03.349 --> 02:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
to vaccinate people so there was
 
02:57:05.389 --> 02:57:05.399 align:start position:0%
basically no protection for vaccines
 
02:57:08.190 --> 02:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
doing that first wave and you can see
 
02:57:09.990 --> 02:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
that on the lower grade that's the death
 
02:57:11.870 --> 02:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
covid death you can see that it's a very
 
02:57:13.670 --> 02:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
high peak of covid death also so that
 
02:57:15.790 --> 02:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
sort of goes together with the peaking
 
02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:17.150 align:start position:0%
sort of goes together with the peaking
in

02:57:17.150 --> 02:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:18.710 align:start position:0%
in
circulations

02:57:18.710 --> 02:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
circulations
 
02:57:22.510 --> 02:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
uh at the second red vertical line
 
02:57:27.510 --> 02:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's when most of the elderly had been
 
02:57:30.070 --> 02:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated but a very small percent of
 
02:57:31.710 --> 02:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
the total population so they focus on
 
02:57:33.309 --> 02:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
the old people so most people I think
 
02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
about 70 had been vaccinated but only 7%
 
02:57:38.229 --> 02:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
of the total
 
02:57:41.550 --> 02:57:41.560 align:start position:0%
population so children know uh young
 
02:57:44.150 --> 02:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
adults know middle AG adults know and
 
02:57:46.150 --> 02:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
you see you have an other peak of Co
 
02:57:47.750 --> 02:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
circulation that's just as big as the
 
02:57:49.110 --> 02:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
first one
 
02:57:51.990 --> 02:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
but there's almost no
 
02:57:54.150 --> 02:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
mortality and that's because they
 
02:57:57.750 --> 02:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinated the elderly first and they
 
02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
sort of cut that uh that third Peak
 
02:58:02.910 --> 02:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
immortality was still they were still
 
02:58:07.469 --> 02:58:07.479 align:start position:0%
there in in in uh in
 
02:58:10.030 --> 02:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
infections thank
 
02:58:14.110 --> 02:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
you representative craan thank you uh
 
02:58:15.429 --> 02:58:15.439 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
02:58:17.389 --> 02:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
question I was wondering if you had any
 
02:58:18.630 --> 02:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:58:22.269 --> 02:58:22.279 align:start position:0%
excess mortality data for just the
 
02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
period from basically 2020 to to before
 
02:58:29.550 --> 02:58:29.560 align:start position:0%
the vaccines were rolled out um just
 
02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about you know trying to make
 
02:58:33.510 --> 02:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
any conclusions about whether certain
 
02:58:35.269 --> 02:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
lockdown measures or you know
 
02:58:37.389 --> 02:58:37.399 align:start position:0%
restriction measures were
 
02:58:40.190 --> 02:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
effective so I would say based on all
 
02:58:42.950 --> 02:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
this seems silly and yeah so I would say
 
02:58:44.229 --> 02:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
that the lockdowns measures were
 
02:58:46.309 --> 02:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
effective in terms of pushing things
 
02:58:49.590 --> 02:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
forward but not the point of them right
 
02:58:51.990 --> 02:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
I mean very few people very few places
 
02:58:56.150 --> 02:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
were under any sort of lockdown Beyond
 
02:58:58.190 --> 02:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
you know mid
 
02:59:00.510 --> 02:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
2020 no there were lots of lockdowns in
 
02:59:04.429 --> 02:59:04.439 align:start position:0%
2011 also 20 into how are we Sorry to to
 
02:59:06.550 --> 02:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
keep going but how are we defining
 
02:59:08.110 --> 02:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
lockdowns I mean it seems like school
 
02:59:10.429 --> 02:59:10.439 align:start position:0%
closures for example is is an important
 
02:59:12.550 --> 02:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
part of right so school closures but can
 
02:59:14.150 --> 02:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
we just say school closures then instead
 
02:59:16.469 --> 02:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
of lockdowns most people you know
 
02:59:18.070 --> 02:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
restaurants were open Bars were open
 
02:59:20.510 --> 02:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
Disneyland was open do you have a
 
02:59:22.790 --> 02:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
question representing craan yeah I guess
 
02:59:25.309 --> 02:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
I I was asking you know if we're looking
 
02:59:28.950 --> 02:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
at the efficacy of of school closures
 
02:59:30.269 --> 02:59:30.279 align:start position:0%
and things like that why aren't we
 
02:59:32.670 --> 02:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
looking at mortality just within that
 
02:59:35.070 --> 02:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
time period instead of getting all the
 
02:59:37.349 --> 02:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
confounding with vaccination and things
 
02:59:40.950 --> 02:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
like that okay I think ultimately it's
 
02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
the it's the mortality in the whole time
 
02:59:47.190 --> 02:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
period that matters because the season
 
02:59:48.990 --> 02:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
because of seasonality
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
some places uh had it had the peaks in
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
different times than others there was
 
02:59:57.150 --> 02:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
also difference in when the virus
 
02:59:59.510 --> 02:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
arrived so it arrived very early to New
 
03:00:02.070 --> 03:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
York for example there was a place in
 
03:00:04.750 --> 03:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
Georgia where it arrived very early is
 
03:00:06.150 --> 03:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
Right early in
 
03:00:08.309 --> 03:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
Washington so if you look at certain
 
03:00:10.070 --> 03:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
periods you can always find a period
 
03:00:12.550 --> 03:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
where one place is higher another one is
 
03:00:15.269 --> 03:00:15.279 align:start position:0%
low but that's really not what matters
 
03:00:16.429 --> 03:00:16.439 align:start position:0%
because it's really the whole time
 
03:00:18.910 --> 03:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
period that matters so I think the best
 
03:00:21.990 --> 03:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
metric is actually uh excess mortality
 
03:00:25.630 --> 03:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
in 2020 to 23 that's the most important
 
03:00:28.510 --> 03:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
measure and then What affected that
 
03:00:30.750 --> 03:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
that's a combination of things so
 
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
lockdowns didn't do much uh school
 
03:00:37.429 --> 03:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
closures did nothing vaccination quickly
 
03:00:39.469 --> 03:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
vaccinating all the people was
 
03:00:42.870 --> 03:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
important uh uh protecting all the
 
03:00:46.870 --> 03:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
people in nursing homes by reducing
 
03:00:48.550 --> 03:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
staff rotation
 
03:00:50.469 --> 03:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
doing more testing in nursing homes that
 
03:00:52.790 --> 03:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
was important closing universities made
 
03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:53.550 align:start position:0%
was important closing universities made
no

03:00:53.550 --> 03:00:53.560 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
difference those are sort of a represent
 
03:01:00.229 --> 03:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and I I just
 
03:01:02.750 --> 03:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh clarify because I I heard I
 
03:01:04.349 --> 03:01:04.359 align:start position:0%
heard somebody mention something
 
03:01:06.590 --> 03:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
regarding these slides about uh excess
 
03:01:08.030 --> 03:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
death all cause mortality but I just
 
03:01:09.750 --> 03:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to be specific these slides
 
03:01:11.910 --> 03:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
regarding vaccines that were
 
03:01:13.309 --> 03:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
administered in Sweden we're only
 
03:01:15.910 --> 03:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
looking at covid mortality correct this
 
03:01:20.429 --> 03:01:20.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:24.830 --> 03:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
now there are theories that the adino
 
03:01:27.469 --> 03:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
VAR Vector vaccines the Johnson and
 
03:01:29.110 --> 03:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
Johnson and asena can actually have
 
03:01:31.710 --> 03:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
beneficial effects on other infections
 
03:01:34.429 --> 03:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
other than covid but that's sted for
 
03:01:40.110 --> 03:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:43.750 --> 03:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
guess so let me go back to
 
03:01:46.830 --> 03:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh the other one and it's almost at the
 
03:01:46.840 --> 03:01:57.870 align:start position:0%
uh the other one and it's almost at the
end

03:01:57.870 --> 03:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:01.510 --> 03:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
so I think one important part of Public
 
03:02:04.389 --> 03:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
Health is that public health one of the
 
03:02:07.349 --> 03:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
principles of Public Health at is that
 
03:02:09.190 --> 03:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
we have to care about the public health
 
03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:11.510 align:start position:0%
we have to care about the public health
of

03:02:11.510 --> 03:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:14.070 --> 03:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
everybody all
 
03:02:19.190 --> 03:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
ages and all areas all time periods but
 
03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:20.590 align:start position:0%
ages and all areas all time periods but
also

03:02:20.590 --> 03:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:02:25.070 --> 03:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
all uh all social groups whether it's
 
03:02:26.670 --> 03:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
the upper class the middle class or the
 
03:02:28.429 --> 03:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
working class or the
 
03:02:31.389 --> 03:02:31.399 align:start position:0%
poor so this is a a
 
03:02:36.030 --> 03:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
cartoon uh that uh some person wrote in
 
03:02:38.870 --> 03:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
03:02:44.110 --> 03:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
the in uh in uh doing the pandemic so
 
03:02:46.790 --> 03:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
what we in a way did in the US instead
 
03:02:48.389 --> 03:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
of doing Focus protect protections for
 
03:02:51.670 --> 03:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
the elderly who at high risk who did
 
03:02:54.790 --> 03:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
Focus protection for the well off for
 
03:02:58.349 --> 03:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
the laptop class which includes me and
 
03:02:59.670 --> 03:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sure some of
 
03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
you so the lockdown have protected the
 
03:03:04.510 --> 03:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
laptop class of young lowrisk
 
03:03:06.190 --> 03:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
journalists te scientists teachers
 
03:03:08.070 --> 03:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
politicians and lawyers while throwing
 
03:03:09.630 --> 03:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
children to the working class and
 
03:03:12.590 --> 03:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
highrisk older people under the bus
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
because it was also the lockdowns
 
03:03:16.870 --> 03:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
affected the middle and working class
 
03:03:19.750 --> 03:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
the worst if look at closing schools for
 
03:03:22.469 --> 03:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
example uh Rich families including the
 
03:03:25.429 --> 03:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
governor of of California sent the kids
 
03:03:28.150 --> 03:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
to private schools that were open uh or
 
03:03:30.229 --> 03:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
they had Tutors or they could afford to
 
03:03:31.870 --> 03:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
have one parent stay at home and do
 
03:03:34.950 --> 03:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
homeschooling or they had pot schools
 
03:03:37.429 --> 03:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
while among the working class and the
 
03:03:39.990 --> 03:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
poor kids were sometimes home alone
 
03:03:43.030 --> 03:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
because both of the parents have to work
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
so uh uh or they didn't have access to
 
03:03:48.790 --> 03:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
computers to do the online stuff
 
03:03:51.910 --> 03:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
so we can see this is Boston we can see
 
03:03:51.920 --> 03:03:53.070 align:start position:0%
so we can see this is Boston we can see
that

03:03:53.070 --> 03:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:03:57.229 --> 03:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh poor areas of Boston did worse
 
03:03:59.110 --> 03:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
wealthier areas of Boston did better
 
03:04:00.389 --> 03:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
when it come to
 
03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
covid this is uh
 
03:04:05.670 --> 03:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
Toronto uh this is only the first part
 
03:04:10.710 --> 03:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic in 200 uh 20 but you
 
03:04:14.630 --> 03:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
could see that uh the when in the
 
03:04:15.990 --> 03:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
beginning everybody was affected but
 
03:04:18.630 --> 03:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
then locks came that protected the
 
03:04:20.269 --> 03:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
the the wealthier neighborhoods but not
 
03:04:21.590 --> 03:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
the working-class
 
03:04:24.510 --> 03:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods later on so they got it
 
03:04:27.870 --> 03:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
the first later on the the everybody the
 
03:04:30.269 --> 03:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
the wealthier neighbors got it as well
 
03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
and that's also for example in India
 
03:04:33.870 --> 03:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
they had two ways in the first way the
 
03:04:35.070 --> 03:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
poor got it and the second way the
 
03:04:36.910 --> 03:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
middle class and the rich got
 
03:04:40.269 --> 03:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
it uh Los Angeles we could see mortality
 
03:04:44.950 --> 03:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
rates were much higher uh among uh uh
 
03:04:46.630 --> 03:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
those with more
 
03:04:46.640 --> 03:04:48.349 align:start position:0%
those with more
poverty

03:04:48.349 --> 03:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
poverty
 
03:04:50.910 --> 03:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
so in in in my view the in here in the
 
03:04:53.389 --> 03:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
US I think the the lockdowns were the
 
03:04:55.950 --> 03:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
worst assault on the on the working
 
03:04:57.670 --> 03:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
class and the middle class since the
 
03:05:02.110 --> 03:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:05.590 --> 03:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
War so our pandemic response Focus
 
03:05:07.790 --> 03:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
protection for the privileged not for
 
03:05:09.830 --> 03:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
those at risk so I think that's a
 
03:05:11.550 --> 03:05:11.560 align:start position:0%
failure of Public
 
03:05:11.560 --> 03:05:13.590 align:start position:0%
failure of Public
Health

03:05:13.590 --> 03:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
Health
 
03:05:16.750 --> 03:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh after being exposed while keeping
 
03:05:18.750 --> 03:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
Society float many workers had strong
 
03:05:20.910 --> 03:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
long-lasting natural immunity from
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
having recovered from disease including
 
03:05:24.870 --> 03:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
nurses and others who took care of Co
 
03:05:26.429 --> 03:05:26.439 align:start position:0%
patients in the hospitals they would
 
03:05:28.469 --> 03:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
take care of the co they got infected
 
03:05:30.269 --> 03:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
they stayed home for a few weeks then
 
03:05:31.670 --> 03:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
they go back to work take care of more
 
03:05:33.670 --> 03:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
Co patients then they would
 
03:05:35.590 --> 03:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
discriminated against by vaccine
 
03:05:37.990 --> 03:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
mandates that forced them to get the
 
03:05:40.150 --> 03:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine even though they already had
 
03:05:43.830 --> 03:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
immunity that was Superior to vaccine
 
03:05:46.630 --> 03:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
immunity uh there was no reason to
 
03:05:49.950 --> 03:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
vaccinate uh people who had already had
 
03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh covid and it was in fact unethical
 
03:05:55.550 --> 03:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
because you were
 
03:05:58.429 --> 03:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
using uh a short there was a shortest of
 
03:06:00.070 --> 03:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines so we're using it on people
 
03:06:03.630 --> 03:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
didn't need it while people older people
 
03:06:05.429 --> 03:06:05.439 align:start position:0%
didn't get it in
 
03:06:08.590 --> 03:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
time uh despite minuscule risk from Co
 
03:06:10.150 --> 03:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
children have carried an extraordinary
 
03:06:11.790 --> 03:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
burden during this pandemic because of
 
03:06:14.510 --> 03:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
the school closures and other lockdown
 
03:06:16.710 --> 03:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
measures uh together with some
 
03:06:20.429 --> 03:06:20.439 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh uh we wrote and I think
 
03:06:23.309 --> 03:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
it's about 80 plus pages of questions
 
03:06:25.469 --> 03:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
for covid-19 Commission because we hope
 
03:06:27.950 --> 03:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
that there will be a federal commission
 
03:06:29.830 --> 03:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
but we are thrilled also that there are
 
03:06:31.510 --> 03:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
commissions here in New Hampshire I
 
03:06:33.349 --> 03:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
think most more States should do that so
 
03:06:36.030 --> 03:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate that so we to put
 
03:06:37.710 --> 03:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
together a list of question that we
 
03:06:39.910 --> 03:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
thought should be asked some of those
 
03:06:41.309 --> 03:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
are relevant for New Hampshire others
 
03:06:42.630 --> 03:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
are more on the federal level in terms
 
03:06:45.870 --> 03:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
of what FDA did and ni did and CDC did
 
03:06:49.510 --> 03:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
but uh you you can find this on the web
 
03:06:52.790 --> 03:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh if you take an
 
03:06:55.950 --> 03:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
interest and I'm happy to respond to any
 
03:06:57.590 --> 03:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
questions I really appreciate that you
 
03:07:00.070 --> 03:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
have questions during the presentations
 
03:07:01.510 --> 03:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh I think that's often the best way to
 
03:07:03.790 --> 03:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
interact so thank you so much well well
 
03:07:06.030 --> 03:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor for being here um
 
03:07:08.070 --> 03:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
couple questions for you is one could
 
03:07:11.590 --> 03:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
you uh email me the your presentation I
 
03:07:13.389 --> 03:07:13.399 align:start position:0%
can do that yes and could you send us a
 
03:07:15.550 --> 03:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
link for the norl group with all that
 
03:07:17.750 --> 03:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
those questions that would be wonderful
 
03:07:19.550 --> 03:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
I think uh I'll forward it on to all our
 
03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
members and does anyone else have
 
03:07:25.469 --> 03:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
questions represent falls off thank you
 
03:07:28.710 --> 03:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
for being here uh I have question you
 
03:07:28.720 --> 03:07:29.870 align:start position:0%
for being here uh I have question you
mentioned

03:07:29.870 --> 03:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:07:33.469 --> 03:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
comparing uh flu and Co and uh I just
 
03:07:36.150 --> 03:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
wonder there was some data that flu
 
03:07:40.349 --> 03:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
almost disappeared during the covid uh
 
03:07:43.510 --> 03:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh so what what you what you can make of
 
03:07:47.550 --> 03:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
it some some some sometimes like
 
03:07:47.560 --> 03:07:49.070 align:start position:0%
it some some some sometimes like
definition

03:07:49.070 --> 03:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
definition
 
03:07:53.190 --> 03:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
of Co covid case uh maybe sometimes it
 
03:07:55.950 --> 03:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
was including flu case especially if
 
03:07:59.309 --> 03:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
there was no testing but maybe some
 
03:08:03.110 --> 03:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
measures on travel restrictions or other
 
03:08:06.429 --> 03:08:06.439 align:start position:0%
like helped stop the flu but not the co
 
03:08:09.550 --> 03:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so there could be some
 
03:08:11.469 --> 03:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
misdiagnosis I don't think that's the
 
03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
main reason I think what you allude to
 
03:08:18.550 --> 03:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
instead is that uh
 
03:08:20.910 --> 03:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
well I will say there's two things one
 
03:08:25.469 --> 03:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
is that the lockdowns did affect other
 
03:08:27.870 --> 03:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
viruses so there were less
 
03:08:31.269 --> 03:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
circulations of of uh other viruses and
 
03:08:33.950 --> 03:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
I think including flu but also RSV for
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
example so some of the childhood
 
03:08:38.150 --> 03:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
diseases uh you would think that that's
 
03:08:39.190 --> 03:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
a good
 
03:08:41.870 --> 03:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
thing and to some extent it is but it
 
03:08:44.269 --> 03:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
also is to some extent the bad things
 
03:08:45.870 --> 03:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
because what happened was then you don't
 
03:08:48.790 --> 03:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
have that sort of continuous exposure
 
03:08:51.070 --> 03:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
and then once the lockdown is broke they
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
come again so we had problems with RSV
 
03:08:55.110 --> 03:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
for example in case after then the
 
03:08:56.469 --> 03:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
lockdowns were
 
03:08:56.479 --> 03:08:57.990 align:start position:0%
lockdowns were
over

03:08:57.990 --> 03:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
over
 
03:09:01.389 --> 03:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
and it might seem harsh but the children
 
03:09:03.070 --> 03:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
has to build up their immune system and
 
03:09:05.790 --> 03:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
you they do that at a very young age and
 
03:09:07.710 --> 03:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
it's very adaptable so that's why that's
 
03:09:10.870 --> 03:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
I think one reason why they did not uh
 
03:09:13.349 --> 03:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
they did very well with Co because they
 
03:09:16.910 --> 03:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
have this adaptable system so uh it's
 
03:09:18.710 --> 03:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
actually good that they were exposed to
 
03:09:21.550 --> 03:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
Co at a very young age because Co is no
 
03:09:23.630 --> 03:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
longer pandemic but it's not endemic
 
03:09:27.510 --> 03:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to live with that for for uh
 
03:09:30.309 --> 03:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
for for the rest of our lives there are
 
03:09:32.150 --> 03:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
four other Corona viruses that been
 
03:09:34.870 --> 03:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
circulating for over a century so now we
 
03:09:37.309 --> 03:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
have five I expect the five to behave
 
03:09:40.269 --> 03:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
about the same we will be exposed to co
 
03:09:42.309 --> 03:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
again we will have be home for a few
 
03:09:44.990 --> 03:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
days but it's the first time that's
 
03:09:48.150 --> 03:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
serious so if if you could Pro if you
 
03:09:49.590 --> 03:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
theoretically if you say you can protect
 
03:09:51.830 --> 03:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
this child from
 
03:09:55.110 --> 03:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
covid until they are 70 years old that
 
03:09:58.110 --> 03:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
is a very very bad idea because once
 
03:10:00.070 --> 03:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
they if they exposed to co for the first
 
03:10:01.389 --> 03:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
time when they are 70 they're actually
 
03:10:03.630 --> 03:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
at risk of dying from
 
03:10:07.990 --> 03:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
it so we don't want to postpone that
 
03:10:10.710 --> 03:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
exposure uh well the other reason I
 
03:10:12.429 --> 03:10:12.439 align:start position:0%
think is that there is certain
 
03:10:16.070 --> 03:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
competition between different viruses so
 
03:10:18.269 --> 03:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
if one thing comes in it sometimes tends
 
03:10:22.070 --> 03:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
to reduce the other one and I don't know
 
03:10:23.910 --> 03:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
that is not my area of expertise so I
 
03:10:25.790 --> 03:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly what the mechanism is
 
03:10:28.030 --> 03:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
so I can explain it but they is sort of
 
03:10:31.269 --> 03:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
competition so that one can compete out
 
03:10:31.279 --> 03:10:32.070 align:start position:0%
competition so that one can compete out
another

03:10:32.070 --> 03:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:10:34.269 --> 03:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
one so that's another potential
 
03:10:36.309 --> 03:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
explanation why why flu because they're
 
03:10:37.790 --> 03:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
similar in some respects so that's why
 
03:10:40.190 --> 03:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
flu wouldn't sort of come out and now of
 
03:10:42.950 --> 03:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
course flu is back because Co is down
 
03:10:44.830 --> 03:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
okay represent Benda then represent
 
03:10:47.070 --> 03:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
beler yeah so I just had a follow-up
 
03:10:49.469 --> 03:10:49.479 align:start position:0%
question question to um to Yuri's
 
03:10:52.590 --> 03:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
question so at one point in time and I
 
03:10:53.670 --> 03:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
can't remember because I've been
 
03:10:56.469 --> 03:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
following this it seems like forever um
 
03:10:59.630 --> 03:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
there was a a point in time for example
 
03:11:02.110 --> 03:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
in our country that the CDC wasn't even
 
03:11:04.269 --> 03:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
tracking so there was a period of time
 
03:11:05.630 --> 03:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
where they weren't really tracking any
 
03:11:08.389 --> 03:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
flu cases because all the focus was on
 
03:11:10.990 --> 03:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
covid and so
 
03:11:13.870 --> 03:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
um because of that reason it's you know
 
03:11:15.349 --> 03:11:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's hard to have data and then of
 
03:11:16.910 --> 03:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
course in the fall when kids went back
 
03:11:19.670 --> 03:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
to school and stuff like that um the
 
03:11:22.710 --> 03:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
focus was really still on Co and not on
 
03:11:24.870 --> 03:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
flu type stuff as well everything was
 
03:11:26.670 --> 03:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
kind of covid whether it was or not I
 
03:11:28.990 --> 03:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
don't know it doesn't matter but um I
 
03:11:31.269 --> 03:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
just was wondering if you had if that
 
03:11:33.630 --> 03:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
kind of same thing was was what you were
 
03:11:36.870 --> 03:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
seeing um outside of like the
 
03:11:39.590 --> 03:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
CDC so I don't think that explains that
 
03:11:42.550 --> 03:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have had the I think we truly
 
03:11:45.910 --> 03:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have much flu for a while uh
 
03:11:47.790 --> 03:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
other that was the same phena was seen
 
03:11:49.670 --> 03:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
in other countries also so I think we
 
03:11:54.510 --> 03:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
truly didn't have flu for for a while um
 
03:11:59.710 --> 03:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
now CDC in my view didn't track Co
 
03:12:02.510 --> 03:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
properly uh because one thing you want
 
03:12:05.349 --> 03:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
to so this is not with New Hampshire but
 
03:12:07.229 --> 03:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
one thing you want to do as a CDC is you
 
03:12:09.469 --> 03:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
want to sort of monitor how many has
 
03:12:11.830 --> 03:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
been affected so you do a Ser prevalence
 
03:12:14.309 --> 03:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
studies to find out how many has been
 
03:12:15.670 --> 03:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
affected now you want to know that for
 
03:12:17.790 --> 03:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
different areas and over time to see
 
03:12:21.110 --> 03:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
increases so uh for example Spain did an
 
03:12:24.550 --> 03:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
excellent survey a very early on in 202
 
03:12:27.510 --> 03:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh 20120 to find out what was the
 
03:12:29.190 --> 03:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
infection rate for different ages and
 
03:12:32.190 --> 03:12:32.200 align:start position:0%
different locations Sweden did a survey
 
03:12:35.750 --> 03:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
was not as as expansive as Spain so was
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
as good as Spain but they did occasional
 
03:12:40.429 --> 03:12:40.439 align:start position:0%
surveys CDC didn't do that until I think
 
03:12:42.910 --> 03:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
two or three years into the pandemic so
 
03:12:44.750 --> 03:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
we were sort of stuck with having there
 
03:12:46.670 --> 03:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
was one done in Santa Clara County I
 
03:12:49.229 --> 03:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
think that was the first one uh but
 
03:12:52.229 --> 03:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
that's one County in one state and so
 
03:12:54.030 --> 03:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
that was very valuable information but
 
03:12:55.550 --> 03:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
we should have had that Nationwide there
 
03:12:57.950 --> 03:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
was one in Southern California there was
 
03:13:00.710 --> 03:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
one I think in Idaho very small one so
 
03:13:02.229 --> 03:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
there was all the spotted things that
 
03:13:04.429 --> 03:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
some scientists managed to get some
 
03:13:07.590 --> 03:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
money for but CDC should have actually
 
03:13:11.229 --> 03:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
done continuous Ser prevalence surveys
 
03:13:13.950 --> 03:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
in the population so that's one that's
 
03:13:16.590 --> 03:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
one one where example where testing is
 
03:13:18.510 --> 03:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
actually important important and you
 
03:13:20.830 --> 03:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
want to test a random people so you want
 
03:13:23.190 --> 03:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
to test the combination of older people
 
03:13:24.950 --> 03:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
and middle-aged people and young people
 
03:13:24.960 --> 03:13:25.830 align:start position:0%
and middle-aged people and young people
and

03:13:25.830 --> 03:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:28.950 --> 03:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
children um and then you want to measure
 
03:13:30.630 --> 03:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
it to see how it changes over time and
 
03:13:32.150 --> 03:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
if it's more in some place and less in
 
03:13:34.269 --> 03:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
other places so that was one thing that
 
03:13:36.830 --> 03:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
CDC didn't do that they should have done
 
03:13:39.229 --> 03:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh but that's not the fault of and New
 
03:13:40.670 --> 03:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because that really falls on
 
03:13:40.680 --> 03:13:42.630 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because that really falls on
cdc's

03:13:42.630 --> 03:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
cdc's
 
03:13:45.389 --> 03:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility represent beler thank you
 
03:13:47.469 --> 03:13:47.479 align:start position:0%
madam chair and for my usual this will
 
03:13:49.790 --> 03:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
be a sort of a multi-part kind of
 
03:13:49.800 --> 03:13:51.190 align:start position:0%
be a sort of a multi-part kind of
question

03:13:51.190 --> 03:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:13:53.550 --> 03:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
um obviously now we have all this
 
03:13:55.070 --> 03:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge where we can compare and
 
03:13:57.150 --> 03:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
correlate the different places with
 
03:13:59.429 --> 03:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
different policies regarding lockdowns
 
03:14:00.910 --> 03:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
and when we say lockdowns there there
 
03:14:02.389 --> 03:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
was quite a bit of differentiation I
 
03:14:04.469 --> 03:14:04.479 align:start position:0%
mean it's not and you could call it just
 
03:14:05.830 --> 03:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
schools and some places that's sort of a
 
03:14:07.790 --> 03:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
light lockdown but we went so far in
 
03:14:09.710 --> 03:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
many places including New Hampshire as
 
03:14:13.229 --> 03:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
to shut down beaches nature trails shut
 
03:14:15.269 --> 03:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
down private businesses even telling
 
03:14:16.710 --> 03:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
people they couldn't Gather in their
 
03:14:16.720 --> 03:14:17.710 align:start position:0%
people they couldn't Gather in their
home

03:14:17.710 --> 03:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
home
 
03:14:19.429 --> 03:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh with more than 10 people with friends
 
03:14:24.229 --> 03:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
and family um so I my question is the
 
03:14:25.990 --> 03:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
the first place I saw this happen going
 
03:14:27.389 --> 03:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
all the way back you know January
 
03:14:29.229 --> 03:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
February March
 
03:14:32.070 --> 03:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
2020 I remember seeing videos coming out
 
03:14:34.269 --> 03:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
of uh out of China out of particularly
 
03:14:36.790 --> 03:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
Wuhan things like welding of apartment
 
03:14:39.550 --> 03:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
doors shut um so they they were really
 
03:14:42.630 --> 03:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
quick on this sort of lockdown model um
 
03:14:45.710 --> 03:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
so my question is do we know where these
 
03:14:48.349 --> 03:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
ideas for these really strict lockdown
 
03:14:51.030 --> 03:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
measures where they came from and what
 
03:14:53.070 --> 03:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
channels they came through to make their
 
03:14:55.630 --> 03:14:55.640 align:start position:0%
way from wherever they came from through
 
03:14:57.630 --> 03:14:57.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know CDC and IH down to the
 
03:15:01.229 --> 03:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:01.239 --> 03:15:02.790 align:start position:0%
 
happened

03:15:02.790 --> 03:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
happened
 
03:15:05.790 --> 03:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know I don't have a good
 
03:15:07.229 --> 03:15:07.239 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
03:15:10.990 --> 03:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
question I mean China lock down brutally
 
03:15:14.429 --> 03:15:14.439 align:start position:0%
brutally but they failed those lockdowns
 
03:15:16.710 --> 03:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
failed uh they kept it under Bay for
 
03:15:19.269 --> 03:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
quite some time with really really harsh
 
03:15:21.550 --> 03:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
lockdowns but in the end they had to
 
03:15:24.389 --> 03:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
lift them and they didn't report all the
 
03:15:29.389 --> 03:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
co cases they have but I have a Chinese
 
03:15:32.590 --> 03:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
friend whose friend's father is a
 
03:15:32.600 --> 03:15:33.630 align:start position:0%
friend whose friend's father is a
funeral

03:15:33.630 --> 03:15:33.640 align:start position:0%
funeral
 
03:15:38.710 --> 03:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
director somewhere in China they was
 
03:15:41.309 --> 03:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
just and after the lockdown was lifted
 
03:15:43.750 --> 03:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
it just went up the
 
03:15:47.150 --> 03:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
roof and they at that time they hadn't
 
03:15:49.790 --> 03:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
um yeah so they and they didn't protect
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
the older people when that happened
 
03:15:52.990 --> 03:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
properly so a lot of older people died
 
03:15:54.349 --> 03:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
in China because of that but we don't
 
03:15:55.790 --> 03:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
have the exact
 
03:15:58.070 --> 03:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
numbers there are also other countries
 
03:16:02.429 --> 03:16:02.439 align:start position:0%
that uh that uh didn't report honestly
 
03:16:04.950 --> 03:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
for example Nicaragua they didn't use
 
03:16:07.189 --> 03:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
neither lockdowns nor Focus protection
 
03:16:09.189 --> 03:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
they sort of just let it
 
03:16:11.590 --> 03:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
happened uh which can be understandable
 
03:16:14.030 --> 03:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
in a PO country and I think it's better
 
03:16:17.790 --> 03:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
than lockdowns but uh they were sort of
 
03:16:19.910 --> 03:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
putting a lid on on the statistics so I
 
03:16:21.269 --> 03:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
was trying to figure out what was going
 
03:16:25.110 --> 03:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
on there and then I saw an article about
 
03:16:25.120 --> 03:16:27.389 align:start position:0%
on there and then I saw an article about
uh

03:16:27.389 --> 03:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:30.349 --> 03:16:30.359 align:start position:0%
carpenters and what would Carpenters let
 
03:16:34.110 --> 03:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:37.630 --> 03:16:37.640 align:start position:0%
Co yeah they made coffins and they were
 
03:16:41.269 --> 03:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
very very busy and they were like you
 
03:16:43.070 --> 03:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
can sort of say how many more with the
 
03:16:44.990 --> 03:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
normal and you can sort of figure out
 
03:16:48.750 --> 03:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
okay Co is going through Nicaragua no
 
03:16:50.150 --> 03:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
question about it we don't know the
 
03:16:51.870 --> 03:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
exact numbers because the state doesn't
 
03:16:53.110 --> 03:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
the country doesn't want to give it out
 
03:16:54.630 --> 03:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
but it's certainly
 
03:16:56.870 --> 03:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
there because some people were claiming
 
03:16:59.030 --> 03:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
that naraga was a perfect example
 
03:17:00.309 --> 03:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
because they didn't lock down and they
 
03:17:01.830 --> 03:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
didn't have any covid death but yeah
 
03:17:05.429 --> 03:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
they did have covid death so represent
 
03:17:08.389 --> 03:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam
 
03:17:10.990 --> 03:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
chair early in one of the slides I think
 
03:17:13.309 --> 03:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
there was a reference to mental
 
03:17:18.710 --> 03:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
health and any thoughts on
 
03:17:22.309 --> 03:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
how to deal with the psychology of the
 
03:17:25.630 --> 03:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
of society of a
 
03:17:28.870 --> 03:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic and trying to figure out how to
 
03:17:28.880 --> 03:17:29.950 align:start position:0%
pandemic and trying to figure out how to
help

03:17:29.950 --> 03:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:17:32.630 --> 03:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
Society deal with a pandemic from a
 
03:17:34.469 --> 03:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
mental health point of view because a
 
03:17:37.309 --> 03:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
lot of uncertainty a lot of fear a lot
 
03:17:40.229 --> 03:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
of unknown um people
 
03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
panic trying to find a way to help
 
03:17:44.710 --> 03:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
Society with dealing with the pandemic
 
03:17:45.990 --> 03:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
from those point of view not So Much
 
03:17:47.950 --> 03:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
from the vaccines but more from the
 
03:17:49.910 --> 03:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
psychology of it
 
03:17:53.710 --> 03:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
all uh that's actually a super critical
 
03:17:56.510 --> 03:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
issue and it goes back to some of the
 
03:17:58.510 --> 03:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
basic principles of Public Health that
 
03:18:01.030 --> 03:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
we used to follow and one of those basic
 
03:18:04.229 --> 03:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
principle is that you don't do
 
03:18:06.070 --> 03:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
fearmongering you should never do
 
03:18:07.630 --> 03:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
fearmongering in public health you
 
03:18:09.870 --> 03:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
should be very truthful about what the
 
03:18:14.150 --> 03:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
risks are and they did surveys to both
 
03:18:19.229 --> 03:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
in UK and in the US is asking if you get
 
03:18:21.150 --> 03:18:21.160 align:start position:0%
Co what do you think is the risk of
 
03:18:24.309 --> 03:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
dying and what people answered was about
 
03:18:26.429 --> 03:18:26.439 align:start position:0%
100 fold higher than the
 
03:18:30.150 --> 03:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
truth so you don't do fear Ming and I
 
03:18:32.429 --> 03:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
guess people did it because they wanted
 
03:18:35.670 --> 03:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
people to take measures to sort of to
 
03:18:37.389 --> 03:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
lock down properly and stuff but you
 
03:18:42.550 --> 03:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
don't do uh fearmongering uh
 
03:18:45.990 --> 03:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
second public health is based on trust
 
03:18:48.110 --> 03:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
it has to be based on trust and that's
 
03:18:50.870 --> 03:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
the two-way street on
 
03:18:50.880 --> 03:18:52.389 align:start position:0%
the two-way street on
trust

03:18:52.389 --> 03:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
trust
 
03:18:57.030 --> 03:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh so you are very honest with what you
 
03:18:59.630 --> 03:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
say and you're very open as the public
 
03:19:01.389 --> 03:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
health agency with what you say and that
 
03:19:03.550 --> 03:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
was not the case during this
 
03:19:06.309 --> 03:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh and you also have to trust
 
03:19:07.510 --> 03:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
the public if you're a public health
 
03:19:10.070 --> 03:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
official you have to trust the public so
 
03:19:11.870 --> 03:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
when you try to Institute mandates
 
03:19:13.429 --> 03:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
enforc you're going to lose a lot of
 
03:19:15.750 --> 03:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
that trust and especially if you do like
 
03:19:18.670 --> 03:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
so one example is the mandating vaccines
 
03:19:20.429 --> 03:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
for people already that had Superior
 
03:19:22.790 --> 03:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
immunity from having recovered people
 
03:19:25.110 --> 03:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
know that people know that we know that
 
03:19:26.429 --> 03:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
for two and a half thousand years since
 
03:19:29.150 --> 03:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
430 BC during the Athenian plague so
 
03:19:32.309 --> 03:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
then to put mandates on that sort of
 
03:19:35.550 --> 03:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
well that has sort of that has created
 
03:19:37.150 --> 03:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
huge problems in public health because
 
03:19:40.309 --> 03:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
now people okay you lied about the covid
 
03:19:42.150 --> 03:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine forcing me to get it even though
 
03:19:43.790 --> 03:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
I had already had
 
03:19:45.910 --> 03:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
protection are you also lying about the
 
03:19:47.349 --> 03:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
meil vaccine
 
03:19:50.110 --> 03:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
about the polio vaccines so now there's
 
03:19:52.189 --> 03:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
a plummeting in trust for childhood
 
03:19:54.710 --> 03:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines which is caused by
 
03:19:54.720 --> 03:19:56.750 align:start position:0%
vaccines which is caused by
these

03:19:56.750 --> 03:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:20:01.070 --> 03:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh pushing uh the covid vaccine to
 
03:20:02.469 --> 03:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
groups that didn't need
 
03:20:05.189 --> 03:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
it I mean if you compare Al to the US
 
03:20:07.790 --> 03:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
and and and
 
03:20:10.870 --> 03:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
Europe Europe is not vaccinating kids
 
03:20:12.910 --> 03:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
for Co it's not needed but here it is
 
03:20:14.349 --> 03:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
that's recommended not many kids are
 
03:20:16.150 --> 03:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
getting it but it's official CDC
 
03:20:16.160 --> 03:20:17.429 align:start position:0%
getting it but it's official CDC
recommendation

03:20:17.429 --> 03:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
03:20:20.469 --> 03:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
so that sort of undermines the trust so
 
03:20:25.110 --> 03:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh I give another example you cannot uh
 
03:20:28.189 --> 03:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
uh let's take for mask for example so we
 
03:20:29.550 --> 03:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
know from their previous presentation
 
03:20:31.950 --> 03:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
but also from the two randomized trials
 
03:20:33.389 --> 03:20:33.399 align:start position:0%
from Denmark in
 
03:20:37.269 --> 03:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
Bangladesh that mask has either zero or
 
03:20:39.950 --> 03:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
minuscule effect on reducing
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
transmission but they were the mask was
 
03:20:43.120 --> 03:20:43.830 align:start position:0%
transmission but they were the mask was
sort

03:20:43.830 --> 03:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
sort
 
03:20:46.990 --> 03:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
of given as this is put a mask mased on
 
03:20:48.710 --> 03:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
and you'll protect yourself and
 
03:20:51.110 --> 03:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
others but that wasn't true because the
 
03:20:54.110 --> 03:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
Mask doesn't protect but it's not an
 
03:20:57.349 --> 03:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
innocent error is actually fatal
 
03:20:59.309 --> 03:20:59.319 align:start position:0%
messaging because what happened was you
 
03:21:04.269 --> 03:21:04.279 align:start position:0%
have people 75y old person they say okay
 
03:21:05.830 --> 03:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
I'll put on the mask and I can go to
 
03:21:07.349 --> 03:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
these rest crowded restaurants and have
 
03:21:08.990 --> 03:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
a nice dinner with my friends because
 
03:21:12.110 --> 03:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
the mask will protect me and others well
 
03:21:15.630 --> 03:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't if you're 75 years old or 85
 
03:21:17.750 --> 03:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
years old you are at risk from Co you
 
03:21:19.910 --> 03:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
should not go to a crowded restaurant if
 
03:21:24.830 --> 03:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
you're 25 go good do it but if you're 75
 
03:21:27.990 --> 03:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't so by giving a false sense
 
03:21:30.550 --> 03:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
of security from masks in my view
 
03:21:35.630 --> 03:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:39.150 --> 03:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
people follow up thank
 
03:21:43.030 --> 03:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
you it's interesting you brought up
 
03:21:46.150 --> 03:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
the correlation between trust going both
 
03:21:46.160 --> 03:21:48.269 align:start position:0%
the correlation between trust going both
ways

03:21:48.269 --> 03:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
ways
 
03:21:50.990 --> 03:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
and my concern is
 
03:21:54.229 --> 03:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
that in order to talk about trust going
 
03:21:57.229 --> 03:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
on both sides from from the public
 
03:21:59.510 --> 03:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
health back to the society and Society
 
03:22:01.750 --> 03:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
back to Public Health that's really
 
03:22:04.110 --> 03:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
predicated upon having some sort
 
03:22:06.550 --> 03:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
of sense that science is running what
 
03:22:08.870 --> 03:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do if we will versus it
 
03:22:10.910 --> 03:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
being political and I'm trying to I know
 
03:22:12.309 --> 03:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
this is science base what I'm trying to
 
03:22:14.870 --> 03:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
get to is the fact that we need to
 
03:22:17.269 --> 03:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
somehow get back to looking at what
 
03:22:18.710 --> 03:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
actually happened because I think New
 
03:22:20.950 --> 03:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a good story to tell when
 
03:22:22.590 --> 03:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
you look at our death rate compared to
 
03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
the other parts in other states given
 
03:22:27.389 --> 03:22:27.399 align:start position:0%
the fact we adjusted for the age
 
03:22:29.910 --> 03:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
population having a higher vaccine rate
 
03:22:31.510 --> 03:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
how do we take that information again
 
03:22:34.189 --> 03:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
back to trying to at least the people in
 
03:22:35.630 --> 03:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that I think we did a
 
03:22:38.070 --> 03:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
fairly good job maybe we didn't do it
 
03:22:39.830 --> 03:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
perfectly maybe there some things we
 
03:22:41.630 --> 03:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
could have done differently but if you
 
03:22:43.790 --> 03:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
look at the end result
 
03:22:46.670 --> 03:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
is the sany of life and trying to
 
03:22:49.229 --> 03:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
protect it and you look at that outcome
 
03:22:51.790 --> 03:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
and talking about death itself as being
 
03:22:53.229 --> 03:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
an end
 
03:22:55.670 --> 03:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
point I think what I'm trying to get to
 
03:22:57.150 --> 03:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
is how do we somehow communicate that
 
03:22:58.349 --> 03:22:58.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire didn't really do a
 
03:23:01.110 --> 03:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
horrible job and I want to try to how do
 
03:23:03.910 --> 03:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
we build and rebuild trust in our own
 
03:23:05.349 --> 03:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
Department here in the state of New
 
03:23:06.710 --> 03:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm not talking about
 
03:23:09.030 --> 03:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
nationally but at least in New Hampshire
 
03:23:11.670 --> 03:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
that we fundamentally did a fairly good
 
03:23:14.510 --> 03:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
job yeah I think and access mortality is
 
03:23:17.030 --> 03:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
the most important metric and obviously
 
03:23:19.349 --> 03:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire did very well so I think
 
03:23:20.429 --> 03:23:20.439 align:start position:0%
that's something that New Hampshire
 
03:23:23.030 --> 03:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
should be proud of uh it's not the only
 
03:23:25.469 --> 03:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
measure because you don't want people to
 
03:23:27.990 --> 03:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
be have be sick even if they
 
03:23:31.189 --> 03:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
survive uh a lot of the mental health
 
03:23:33.189 --> 03:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
problems did not not to death some do
 
03:23:35.950 --> 03:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
with OPM overdoses or or so but a lot of
 
03:23:37.429 --> 03:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
the mental health problem does not lead
 
03:23:40.269 --> 03:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
to death for example I have a colleague
 
03:23:43.349 --> 03:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh at Harvard she she works with autism
 
03:23:46.590 --> 03:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh families with autism and they were
 
03:23:47.990 --> 03:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
devastated by these lockdowns because
 
03:23:50.150 --> 03:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
these autism patients didn't get the
 
03:23:53.269 --> 03:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
treatment they they needed so they were
 
03:23:55.030 --> 03:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
it was very tragic but didn't die from
 
03:23:58.870 --> 03:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
it but they sort of deteriorated these
 
03:24:01.670 --> 03:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
these patients so uh and of course
 
03:24:04.550 --> 03:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
education doesn't kill not sending
 
03:24:06.030 --> 03:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
people to school but it has long-term
 
03:24:09.670 --> 03:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
consequences so mortality I think is in
 
03:24:11.830 --> 03:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
my view the most important metric but
 
03:24:13.469 --> 03:24:13.479 align:start position:0%
it's Al there are also other important
 
03:24:16.990 --> 03:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
metrics including education and uh
 
03:24:18.670 --> 03:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
and mental health for
 
03:24:22.990 --> 03:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
example thank um uh thank you again uh
 
03:24:26.830 --> 03:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
Dr kof um I agree with
 
03:24:29.389 --> 03:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
um represent Merchant that we need to
 
03:24:31.750 --> 03:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
focus on the science and everything but
 
03:24:34.070 --> 03:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
we in the trust but we also have to
 
03:24:37.750 --> 03:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
realize the harms that were done
 
03:24:39.630 --> 03:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
especially to the young
 
03:24:42.189 --> 03:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
population um with with the school
 
03:24:43.750 --> 03:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
shutdowns whether you call them
 
03:24:45.630 --> 03:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
shutdowns or lockdowns in the mental
 
03:24:45.640 --> 03:24:47.110 align:start position:0%
shutdowns or lockdowns in the mental
health

03:24:47.110 --> 03:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
health
 
03:24:50.750 --> 03:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh and I know the children with
 
03:24:54.550 --> 03:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities really suffered under these
 
03:24:58.870 --> 03:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
lockdowns um and yet today after
 
03:25:01.670 --> 03:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
listening to this we in New Hampshire
 
03:25:04.150 --> 03:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
still pushing the covid vaccines for the
 
03:25:06.750 --> 03:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
young population but yet we're hearing
 
03:25:11.110 --> 03:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
today from an infectious disease doctor
 
03:25:13.670 --> 03:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
that says that the population that's
 
03:25:16.630 --> 03:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
most at risk is the over 70 population
 
03:25:20.910 --> 03:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
ation um and obviously we know that we
 
03:25:22.590 --> 03:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
did the best we could in our nursing
 
03:25:26.189 --> 03:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
homes um having as we all sitting here
 
03:25:28.630 --> 03:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
deal with our County nursing homes um
 
03:25:30.630 --> 03:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
and know the struggles that they have
 
03:25:33.110 --> 03:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
gone through and are still going through
 
03:25:35.510 --> 03:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
and with some of the protocols that were
 
03:25:37.630 --> 03:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
put in place not necessarily by the
 
03:25:39.309 --> 03:25:39.319 align:start position:0%
state but at the federal level that
 
03:25:42.070 --> 03:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
actually harmed nursing homes especially
 
03:25:45.030 --> 03:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
in my area uh because of certain
 
03:25:47.910 --> 03:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
mandates um
 
03:25:49.870 --> 03:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to be cognizant of
 
03:25:53.070 --> 03:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
that also I think both of you are making
 
03:25:54.910 --> 03:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
super excellent points because when it
 
03:25:56.550 --> 03:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
comes to trust there's two things that
 
03:25:58.110 --> 03:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
are important one is to say if something
 
03:26:00.469 --> 03:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
goes well you have to tell about it but
 
03:26:02.110 --> 03:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
also if something goes bad you have to
 
03:26:03.750 --> 03:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
be honest about it and I want to give
 
03:26:06.550 --> 03:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
you the example from K from Sweden uh
 
03:26:08.030 --> 03:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
because swed the public health authority
 
03:26:10.269 --> 03:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
in Sweden has very high trust level in
 
03:26:10.279 --> 03:26:11.229 align:start position:0%
in Sweden has very high trust level in
the

03:26:11.229 --> 03:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:26:14.750 --> 03:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
population uh uh and I know that's both
 
03:26:16.710 --> 03:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
from surveys I'm talking to people
 
03:26:19.710 --> 03:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
personally but in the spring of
 
03:26:21.750 --> 03:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
2020 there were a lot of death in
 
03:26:23.670 --> 03:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
Stockholm area in the nursing
 
03:26:26.269 --> 03:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
homes so it was a complete failure in
 
03:26:29.150 --> 03:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes in the Stockholm area
 
03:26:31.309 --> 03:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
but the head State technologist Anders
 
03:26:33.870 --> 03:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
Tel he went out very honest and say yeah
 
03:26:35.189 --> 03:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
we messed
 
03:26:37.510 --> 03:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
up and the fact that he actually
 
03:26:39.790 --> 03:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that that was a
 
03:26:41.910 --> 03:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
mistake that builds
 
03:26:45.150 --> 03:26:45.160 align:start position:0%
trust okay uh he realized that it was it
 
03:26:47.710 --> 03:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
was a mistake he realized says it he he
 
03:26:47.720 --> 03:26:48.870 align:start position:0%
was a mistake he realized says it he he
acknowledges

03:26:48.870 --> 03:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledges
 
03:26:52.150 --> 03:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
it that so acknowledging mistakes builds
 
03:26:54.750 --> 03:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
trust for the future telling the
 
03:26:56.750 --> 03:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
successes also builds trust for the
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
future so I think it's sort of you have
 
03:27:00.150 --> 03:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
to do both of those
 
03:27:02.389 --> 03:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
things so you make a good team the two
 
03:27:02.399 --> 03:27:03.910 align:start position:0%
things so you make a good team the two
of

03:27:03.910 --> 03:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:27:07.150 --> 03:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
you um represent beler then
 
03:27:08.590 --> 03:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
representative po off thank you madam
 
03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
chair I I want to talk about the same
 
03:27:13.110 --> 03:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
thing that we're discussing and get a
 
03:27:16.550 --> 03:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
little bit more in depth because we do
 
03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
want to take the a genuinely good thing
 
03:27:22.590 --> 03:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
that we have which is one of the lowest
 
03:27:25.229 --> 03:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
um rates of mortality among among the
 
03:27:27.550 --> 03:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
elderly population which is excellent
 
03:27:29.030 --> 03:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then we also need to balloon that
 
03:27:31.910 --> 03:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
out and put it in the the entire broad
 
03:27:34.349 --> 03:27:34.359 align:start position:0%
context of everything that occurred and
 
03:27:36.630 --> 03:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
what we've just learned I think uh based
 
03:27:39.309 --> 03:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
on the presentation is that the lockdown
 
03:27:41.269 --> 03:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
without looking at any other measures
 
03:27:44.309 --> 03:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
seems to have done more harm than good
 
03:27:46.229 --> 03:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
but then can we also take for instance
 
03:27:48.070 --> 03:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
let's say um we can take the average
 
03:27:49.830 --> 03:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
mortality rate among that older
 
03:27:52.070 --> 03:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
population in the United States and we
 
03:27:53.710 --> 03:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
can actually say according to this
 
03:27:56.510 --> 03:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
average rate versus the rate that we
 
03:27:58.630 --> 03:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
actually see which is far better in New
 
03:28:02.030 --> 03:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how many lives did we save
 
03:28:05.110 --> 03:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
cumulatively with all the measures we
 
03:28:07.710 --> 03:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
took can we actually say that that
 
03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
number of lives that were
 
03:28:12.670 --> 03:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
saved um is
 
03:28:15.670 --> 03:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
more than the number of lives that are
 
03:28:19.030 --> 03:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
have been and are going to be lost based
 
03:28:21.510 --> 03:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
on things like increased rates of cancer
 
03:28:23.870 --> 03:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
from the diagnoses that were missed the
 
03:28:26.269 --> 03:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
deaths of Despair and everything else so
 
03:28:28.030 --> 03:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
do what is your opinion on that do you
 
03:28:31.590 --> 03:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
think we actually have a net gain in
 
03:28:36.269 --> 03:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:40.389 --> 03:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
tell I think those uh are very very
 
03:28:42.750 --> 03:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
difficult questions to answer and there
 
03:28:44.670 --> 03:28:44.680 align:start position:0%
are some scientists who doing some
 
03:28:48.070 --> 03:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
modeling exercises trying to sort of
 
03:28:50.269 --> 03:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
estimate those things I think that's
 
03:28:50.279 --> 03:28:51.349 align:start position:0%
estimate those things I think that's
pretty

03:28:51.349 --> 03:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
03:28:51.359 --> 03:28:53.349 align:start position:0%
pretty
futile

03:28:53.349 --> 03:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
futile
 
03:28:56.150 --> 03:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
um we can sort of see we can I think
 
03:28:58.670 --> 03:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
it's possible for example to estimate
 
03:29:02.510 --> 03:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
how many excess cancer cases were
 
03:29:05.189 --> 03:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
there because of the lockdowns during
 
03:29:05.199 --> 03:29:06.110 align:start position:0%
there because of the lockdowns during
the

03:29:06.110 --> 03:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:29:08.950 --> 03:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh we can to date we can only
 
03:29:10.510 --> 03:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
estimate that for a short period because
 
03:29:12.150 --> 03:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
we don't know how much that will be in
 
03:29:13.750 --> 03:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
the future but eventually we'll be able
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
to do it for a longer time period we can
 
03:29:18.790 --> 03:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
estimate how many excess o maybe o
 
03:29:20.670 --> 03:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
opiate overdoses there were or how many
 
03:29:22.790 --> 03:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
excess cardiovascular but to put it all
 
03:29:25.990 --> 03:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
together is actually very very difficult
 
03:29:28.229 --> 03:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
what one can do is we can say well if
 
03:29:30.349 --> 03:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had the same rate as New
 
03:29:33.229 --> 03:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
York how many more people would have
 
03:29:35.550 --> 03:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
died that you can
 
03:29:37.990 --> 03:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
do uh
 
03:29:40.870 --> 03:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
but then there as has been pointed out
 
03:29:43.469 --> 03:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
there are so many differences so what
 
03:29:45.510 --> 03:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
what what what was the reasons for that
 
03:29:48.189 --> 03:29:48.199 align:start position:0%
how much was vaccinations how much were
 
03:29:51.150 --> 03:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
were school closures well zero but how
 
03:29:53.469 --> 03:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
much were thought I mean New York sent
 
03:29:56.030 --> 03:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
sick nursing home patients into Nur sick
 
03:29:58.189 --> 03:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
Co patient into nursing
 
03:30:01.550 --> 03:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
homes that was obviously disaster I
 
03:30:04.110 --> 03:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
assume that New Hampshire didn't do
 
03:30:07.590 --> 03:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
that uh if if New Hampshire did it was a
 
03:30:10.429 --> 03:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
big mistake but I assume it didn't and
 
03:30:13.269 --> 03:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
maybe New Hampshire has a more smaller
 
03:30:16.150 --> 03:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
nursing home population smaller nursing
 
03:30:18.150 --> 03:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
home population so for example that's
 
03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
one thing that makes a difference if you
 
03:30:23.070 --> 03:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
have big cities with large nursing homes
 
03:30:25.110 --> 03:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
if if it gets in there can affect a lot
 
03:30:28.070 --> 03:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
of people if you have more rural areas
 
03:30:30.269 --> 03:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
with smaller nursing homes so maybe a
 
03:30:32.790 --> 03:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
doen if it goes in in one it only
 
03:30:34.389 --> 03:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
affects those doen and the other ones
 
03:30:35.990 --> 03:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
are protected because it doesn't get
 
03:30:38.750 --> 03:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
there uh so size of some nursing homes
 
03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
and staff rotation and all those things
 
03:30:44.790 --> 03:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
affect things also and most of the most
 
03:30:47.189 --> 03:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
I think of the difference in the these
 
03:30:51.910 --> 03:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
covid rates are because of what you did
 
03:30:53.550 --> 03:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
with the older people because they are
 
03:30:55.790 --> 03:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
the ones who either died or
 
03:30:58.309 --> 03:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
survived when it comes to excess
 
03:31:00.510 --> 03:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
mortality it also includes younger
 
03:31:03.590 --> 03:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
people and it's actually interesting
 
03:31:06.590 --> 03:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
to so what did this was to to look at
 
03:31:08.750 --> 03:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
access mortality by age
 
03:31:11.990 --> 03:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
group uh because excess mortality if you
 
03:31:14.269 --> 03:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
have excess mortality in the younger
 
03:31:18.469 --> 03:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
people below uh we can look at that
 
03:31:20.750 --> 03:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
here this is that slide that's so hard
 
03:31:23.389 --> 03:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
to so the one furthest to the right is
 
03:31:25.670 --> 03:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
15 to 44 there were Fair few covid
 
03:31:28.670 --> 03:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
mortality there so if you if you compare
 
03:31:32.110 --> 03:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
that that's basically things a lot
 
03:31:35.670 --> 03:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
things to do with the lockdowns and uh
 
03:31:37.870 --> 03:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
um but lockdowns also affect different
 
03:31:39.790 --> 03:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
areas if you have a small like I live in
 
03:31:42.670 --> 03:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
a rural area there wasn't many people
 
03:31:44.150 --> 03:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
were out walking and we were going to
 
03:31:45.469 --> 03:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
the playgrounds no matter what we just
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
ignored those
 
03:31:49.389 --> 03:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
things uh but in the cities they were
 
03:31:51.309 --> 03:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
sort of closed out
 
03:31:54.429 --> 03:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
so so that's also a part of things so I
 
03:31:56.790 --> 03:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
think that was healthy for my my town
 
03:31:59.389 --> 03:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
that that uh we could go to the
 
03:32:01.710 --> 03:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
playground with the kids but in some
 
03:32:04.510 --> 03:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:08.990 --> 03:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't represent P off so uh thank you
 
03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
I want to expand what chair was saying
 
03:32:16.910 --> 03:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
about kids and uh steel policy is trying
 
03:32:21.550 --> 03:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
uh to uh protect the group that probably
 
03:32:24.070 --> 03:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
does not need protection and in the
 
03:32:27.990 --> 03:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
beginning you showed Wuhan mortality
 
03:32:32.030 --> 03:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
data by age and then some us data by age
 
03:32:37.070 --> 03:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
so basically could you qualify that data
 
03:32:40.910 --> 03:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
in relation of risk for kids and also
 
03:32:45.349 --> 03:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
like uh put some time stamp so when when
 
03:32:48.389 --> 03:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
so it looks like from the very very very
 
03:32:53.229 --> 03:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
beginning in 2020 you it says April 2020
 
03:32:57.269 --> 03:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
you knew that uh kids are not especially
 
03:33:00.349 --> 03:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
dying from covid but when did we learn
 
03:33:04.990 --> 03:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
also like that they're not damaged much
 
03:33:08.590 --> 03:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
by by this illness uh because some
 
03:33:11.950 --> 03:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
illnesses like poo it might not kill you
 
03:33:14.750 --> 03:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
but still you don't want the
 
03:33:17.870 --> 03:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
consequences and um
 
03:33:21.389 --> 03:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
so uh would it be
 
03:33:25.349 --> 03:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
your assessment that we don't need to
 
03:33:29.830 --> 03:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
protect uh kids and young adults at all
 
03:33:33.070 --> 03:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
of this disease or do we still need some
 
03:33:35.670 --> 03:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
protection for them so could you qualify
 
03:33:35.680 --> 03:33:38.349 align:start position:0%
protection for them so could you qualify
that

03:33:38.349 --> 03:33:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:41.150 --> 03:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
data uh I don't think we need to protect
 
03:33:43.910 --> 03:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
children from covid there might be some
 
03:33:46.790 --> 03:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
exceptions with um
 
03:33:48.910 --> 03:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
um with who are immune immune
 
03:33:52.269 --> 03:33:52.279 align:start position:0%
compromised for whatever reasons but
 
03:33:55.110 --> 03:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
other than that no and I think uh they
 
03:33:57.670 --> 03:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
need to be exposed so that they have
 
03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
then their immunity for the rest of
 
03:34:01.429 --> 03:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
their lives because Co is going to be
 
03:34:06.030 --> 03:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
with them for the next 60 or 80 or 100
 
03:34:09.389 --> 03:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
years however long they live so uh no I
 
03:34:11.070 --> 03:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to protect children
 
03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
from uh and and I mean we know
 
03:34:17.389 --> 03:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
that there were never any reports of
 
03:34:20.710 --> 03:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
serious consequences sort of uh uh
 
03:34:22.710 --> 03:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
long-term consequences from
 
03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
covid among children there are as with
 
03:34:28.870 --> 03:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
any viruses you can have long-term
 
03:34:31.389 --> 03:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
consequences after having covid same
 
03:34:31.399 --> 03:34:32.269 align:start position:0%
consequences after having covid same
with

03:34:32.269 --> 03:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:34:34.950 --> 03:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
influenza but uh it operates about the
 
03:34:37.590 --> 03:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
same as influenza in that
 
03:34:41.150 --> 03:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
respect follow up uh can you give me
 
03:34:44.229 --> 03:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
some time stamp when the science data
 
03:34:47.309 --> 03:34:47.319 align:start position:0%
was uh back in up this statement was
 
03:34:49.990 --> 03:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
this one says June previous one said
 
03:34:53.229 --> 03:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
April so when did we learn that kids
 
03:34:56.830 --> 03:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
don't actually need that protection so
 
03:34:58.750 --> 03:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
this is June when we actually knew the
 
03:34:58.760 --> 03:34:59.830 align:start position:0%
this is June when we actually knew the
absolute

03:34:59.830 --> 03:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
absolute
 
03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
risk this was uh I published in April
 
03:35:04.590 --> 03:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
but this was available I think actually
 
03:35:07.150 --> 03:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
the calculations in end of February
 
03:35:09.870 --> 03:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
probably so the relative risk that we
 
03:35:12.269 --> 03:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
knew this age gradient was known before
 
03:35:14.630 --> 03:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
there was a single covid death in the
 
03:35:19.469 --> 03:35:19.479 align:start position:0%
US yes from the but it wasn't very well
 
03:35:21.790 --> 03:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh it was known or anybody who was
 
03:35:23.150 --> 03:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
interested in it but it wasn't very
 
03:35:23.160 --> 03:35:24.590 align:start position:0%
interested in it but it wasn't very
commonly

03:35:24.590 --> 03:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
commonly
 
03:35:26.830 --> 03:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
known thank
 
03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
you uh I'm just going to do one final
 
03:35:31.910 --> 03:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
question um because we're going to break
 
03:35:35.750 --> 03:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
for lunch um but my question and and you
 
03:35:37.510 --> 03:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
talked about natural immunity a little
 
03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
bit so is if an a child or a young adult
 
03:35:46.110 --> 03:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
got covid is that more beneficial uh for
 
03:35:47.670 --> 03:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
building up their immunity so that when
 
03:35:49.469 --> 03:35:49.479 align:start position:0%
they're older and this is and say
 
03:35:51.830 --> 03:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
something else happens that this would
 
03:35:54.389 --> 03:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
help them their immune
 
03:35:58.110 --> 03:35:58.120 align:start position:0%
system so I don't know if
 
03:36:00.950 --> 03:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
having if the immunity get as having
 
03:36:02.790 --> 03:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
being exposed a child is better than the
 
03:36:04.229 --> 03:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
immunity you get as an adult I don't
 
03:36:06.590 --> 03:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
know if that's the case or not what I do
 
03:36:08.910 --> 03:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
know is that the risks from the from
 
03:36:10.710 --> 03:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
having it the first time is much lower
 
03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
as a child than even so the risk is
 
03:36:16.150 --> 03:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
lower if you are 10 years than if you
 
03:36:20.349 --> 03:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
are 50 but it's lower than 50 than 60 I
 
03:36:22.710 --> 03:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
think the the risk of mortality doubles
 
03:36:25.469 --> 03:36:25.479 align:start position:0%
around every of every seven years of age
 
03:36:28.269 --> 03:36:28.279 align:start position:0%
so it's a very rapid thing now I would
 
03:36:30.670 --> 03:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
say also that this is for
 
03:36:33.229 --> 03:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
Co we will have another pandemic it
 
03:36:37.550 --> 03:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
could be different so the the 1918 flu
 
03:36:40.950 --> 03:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic it was different the children
 
03:36:42.429 --> 03:36:42.439 align:start position:0%
were actually and young people were
 
03:36:44.910 --> 03:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
actually hardly hard hit and it seemed
 
03:36:48.030 --> 03:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
like old the people had some immunity
 
03:36:49.550 --> 03:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
maybe because something that they were
 
03:36:52.550 --> 03:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
exposed to 50 years
 
03:36:56.590 --> 03:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
ago so uh so it could go it could go
 
03:36:56.600 --> 03:36:57.590 align:start position:0%
ago so uh so it could go it could go
either

03:36:57.590 --> 03:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:36:57.600 --> 03:37:00.710 align:start position:0%
either
way

03:37:00.710 --> 03:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:04.590 --> 03:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
uh oh uh representative likeus last
 
03:37:07.750 --> 03:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted to sort of
 
03:37:09.469 --> 03:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
summarize a
 
03:37:12.590 --> 03:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
takeaway which would be in any future
 
03:37:15.110 --> 03:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic we have to figure out who's
 
03:37:17.070 --> 03:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
going to be the the most at risk and
 
03:37:19.750 --> 03:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's where we focus our protection is
 
03:37:23.269 --> 03:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
that General takeaway and not try to
 
03:37:23.279 --> 03:37:24.710 align:start position:0%
that General takeaway and not try to
protect

03:37:24.710 --> 03:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
protect
 
03:37:27.670 --> 03:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
everybody if if if if it's very
 
03:37:29.950 --> 03:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
different between one group and another
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
yes that is the take home because we can
 
03:37:34.229 --> 03:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
never lock down Society completely
 
03:37:35.910 --> 03:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
either because we need food and
 
03:37:39.150 --> 03:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
electricity and sewage and garbage
 
03:37:41.870 --> 03:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
collection and all those things uh so
 
03:37:43.910 --> 03:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
that is the T Tao measures the other
 
03:37:46.790 --> 03:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
dimension is that for thing like
 
03:37:50.670 --> 03:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
influenza whether it was 1918 or or or
 
03:37:54.510 --> 03:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
or or now or it's covid those are things
 
03:37:57.910 --> 03:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
that you can't suppress it's fule to do
 
03:37:59.389 --> 03:37:59.399 align:start position:0%
it there were attempts to suppress it
 
03:38:01.309 --> 03:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
like the zero
 
03:38:04.469 --> 03:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
covid uh philosophy that's has no
 
03:38:07.189 --> 03:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
scientific basis you can suppress
 
03:38:10.309 --> 03:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
it um Ebola is
 
03:38:12.630 --> 03:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
different uh we have some Ebola cases in
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
the US we don't want Ebola to spread
 
03:38:19.830 --> 03:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
but uh that's different it's very if
 
03:38:22.590 --> 03:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
somebody's guess Eola we can pick it up
 
03:38:26.830 --> 03:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
very quickly it won't sort of spread uh
 
03:38:29.910 --> 03:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
underground in secret it's very sort of
 
03:38:32.910 --> 03:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
visible but so if we have somebody with
 
03:38:36.389 --> 03:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
ebola we need to isolate them so Public
 
03:38:39.710 --> 03:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
Health has the power to isolate people
 
03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
who POS a threat because they have an
 
03:38:44.429 --> 03:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
infection and that's an
 
03:38:47.870 --> 03:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
important uh tool in the public health
 
03:38:51.670 --> 03:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
toolbox if somebody gets Ebola here in
 
03:38:54.590 --> 03:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
Concord New Hampshire we should isolate
 
03:38:57.469 --> 03:38:57.479 align:start position:0%
them in the hospital and everybody
 
03:38:59.870 --> 03:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
taking care of them should have all this
 
03:39:03.309 --> 03:39:03.319 align:start position:0%
and not just the a mask a surgical mask
 
03:39:05.630 --> 03:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
but they have to have all the all the
 
03:39:05.640 --> 03:39:06.630 align:start position:0%
but they have to have all the all the
whole

03:39:06.630 --> 03:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
whole
 
03:39:10.030 --> 03:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
thing uh so there are times when we need
 
03:39:14.030 --> 03:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
to isolate people who are sick uh so if
 
03:39:17.110 --> 03:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
the next pandemic or potential pandemic
 
03:39:20.189 --> 03:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
is Ebola or something similar then we
 
03:39:23.550 --> 03:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
have to sort of uh uh suppress that I
 
03:39:27.790 --> 03:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
mean also uh uh during the last few
 
03:39:31.670 --> 03:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
years we had the the aox or monkey pox
 
03:39:34.389 --> 03:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
epidemic here in the US and that was
 
03:39:37.389 --> 03:39:37.399 align:start position:0%
also very specific uh population that
 
03:39:40.750 --> 03:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
was at highest risk uh homosexual men so
 
03:39:42.429 --> 03:39:42.439 align:start position:0%
then we have to focus the protection of
 
03:39:44.110 --> 03:39:44.120 align:start position:0%
that and there was some discussion in
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
public health and I have a colleague in
 
03:39:47.830 --> 03:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
New York City Health Department who was
 
03:39:49.110 --> 03:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
sort of involved in this and he was
 
03:39:50.910 --> 03:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
urging well we have to protect the
 
03:39:54.309 --> 03:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
homosexual men but somehow some matters
 
03:39:57.030 --> 03:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
like we have to be equal with everybody
 
03:39:58.910 --> 03:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
but that does a disservice to those who
 
03:40:02.710 --> 03:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
are higher risk so um uh eventually I
 
03:40:05.070 --> 03:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
think it came to that but for a while it
 
03:40:06.590 --> 03:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
was sort of more
 
03:40:09.750 --> 03:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
General and uh so but that's an example
 
03:40:12.670 --> 03:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
again we find the population at highest
 
03:40:15.550 --> 03:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
risk and we protect them because if if
 
03:40:17.870 --> 03:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
we care about them then we protect them
 
03:40:19.910 --> 03:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
if we care about the older people we
 
03:40:22.189 --> 03:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
protect them during Co if if we care
 
03:40:25.670 --> 03:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
about homosexuals people then we then we
 
03:40:28.710 --> 03:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
protect them during the the ambox uh
 
03:40:31.870 --> 03:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
outbreak and so on whatever whatever it
 
03:40:34.630 --> 03:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
is um if it's children we have to
 
03:40:36.150 --> 03:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
protect them against
 
03:40:39.870 --> 03:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
polio so represent represent Merchant go
 
03:40:41.349 --> 03:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
ahead it's more of a comment than a
 
03:40:44.229 --> 03:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
question sure I I concur with what the
 
03:40:46.670 --> 03:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
um doctor is saying
 
03:40:48.790 --> 03:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
but I also look at I'm a strong believer
 
03:40:50.950 --> 03:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
in what I call evidence-based medicine
 
03:40:52.830 --> 03:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that's very important but at the
 
03:40:54.550 --> 03:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
same time in order to collect the
 
03:40:55.790 --> 03:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
evidence you have to go through a
 
03:40:57.670 --> 03:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
certain studies and trials and so forth
 
03:41:00.309 --> 03:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
A lot of times it's after the fact so
 
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
therefore I want to say thank you for
 
03:41:04.710 --> 03:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
being here but when we're going into a
 
03:41:07.710 --> 03:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic we don't have a lot of facts at
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
the onset we
 
03:41:13.510 --> 03:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
have hypothesis but we don't have truly
 
03:41:16.590 --> 03:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
evidence to say which way we should go
 
03:41:18.349 --> 03:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
once we get into the pandemic we collect
 
03:41:20.349 --> 03:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
the facts and data then we have some
 
03:41:22.630 --> 03:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
evidence to start making decisions but I
 
03:41:24.110 --> 03:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
want to be sure of the committee that
 
03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
until we get into that evidence base we
 
03:41:29.590 --> 03:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
don't have that evidence to drive us so
 
03:41:32.309 --> 03:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes with public health we have to
 
03:41:35.229 --> 03:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
make some decisions based upon not clear
 
03:41:38.070 --> 03:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
facts so want to be clear factually that
 
03:41:39.670 --> 03:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing something and not expect
 
03:41:41.550 --> 03:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
people in public health to have all the
 
03:41:43.950 --> 03:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
answers when it starts just it's more of
 
03:41:45.550 --> 03:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
a comment than a and and in
 
03:41:47.870 --> 03:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative I I I concur with you on
 
03:41:50.670 --> 03:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
that however I think that some of the
 
03:41:50.680 --> 03:41:52.269 align:start position:0%
that however I think that some of the
facts

03:41:52.269 --> 03:41:52.279 align:start position:0%
facts
 
03:41:55.229 --> 03:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
um were were
 
03:41:59.229 --> 03:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
known more ahead quicker than what we
 
03:42:01.790 --> 03:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
they were relay to the public and if Dr
 
03:42:03.670 --> 03:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
Koff would like to comment he is more
 
03:42:05.630 --> 03:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
than willing yeah actually that's the
 
03:42:08.750 --> 03:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
third thing in terms of Trust for Public
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
Health is to say when we don't know we
 
03:42:12.910 --> 03:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
say we don't know and I have never done
 
03:42:14.790 --> 03:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
sort of media things before for this
 
03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
pandemic so I was sort of thrown in it
 
03:42:18.670 --> 03:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
without wanting to but I did a number of
 
03:42:21.309 --> 03:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
interviews um after the Great Prank
 
03:42:23.429 --> 03:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
declaration and sometimes they will ask
 
03:42:25.349 --> 03:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
me a question and I says well I don't
 
03:42:27.630 --> 03:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that that's not my a
 
03:42:30.630 --> 03:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
of expertise and first I felt bad about
 
03:42:32.309 --> 03:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
it but then I actually realized no
 
03:42:34.750 --> 03:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
that's actually good because if I say
 
03:42:36.550 --> 03:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
that they actually trust me more on
 
03:42:38.710 --> 03:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
those things that we do know something
 
03:42:41.950 --> 03:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
so there are things we you're right we
 
03:42:44.110 --> 03:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
gradually knew things uh with the
 
03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh so we knew about the age
 
03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
gradients on relative risk very soon but
 
03:42:52.149 --> 03:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
the absolute risk came uh probably about
 
03:42:54.070 --> 03:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
half a year later and it was impossible
 
03:42:58.349 --> 03:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
to know that earlier so as public health
 
03:42:59.790 --> 03:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
we have to acknowledge what we don't
 
03:43:03.269 --> 03:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
know but also as public health we have
 
03:43:06.309 --> 03:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
to actively get some of that information
 
03:43:07.990 --> 03:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
and some of it was done but some of it
 
03:43:09.750 --> 03:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
was not done properly so I said for
 
03:43:11.149 --> 03:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
example that Spain lead the zero
 
03:43:12.750 --> 03:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
prevalence service very early that was
 
03:43:14.550 --> 03:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
very good every country should have done
 
03:43:16.630 --> 03:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
that very soon and
 
03:43:18.750 --> 03:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
continuously so
 
03:43:21.990 --> 03:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh but yeah uh I mean as the
 
03:43:24.189 --> 03:43:24.199 align:start position:0%
scientist is sort of fascinating to get
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
this new disease and learning more and
 
03:43:28.070 --> 03:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
more about it at the same time it's sort
 
03:43:29.670 --> 03:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
of terrifying because you realize that
 
03:43:33.070 --> 03:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
people are dying from it so um yeah but
 
03:43:34.229 --> 03:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
we have to acknowledge when we don't
 
03:43:34.239 --> 03:43:37.189 align:start position:0%
we have to acknowledge when we don't
know

03:43:37.189 --> 03:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:40.189 --> 03:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
something thank you very much Dr Kula
 
03:43:42.750 --> 03:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
for being here I I greatly appreciate it
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
you've been a wealth of information uh
 
03:43:48.309 --> 03:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
for us um we actually have suon coming
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
in at 1 but I will see if I can postpone
 
03:43:53.830 --> 03:43:53.840 align:start position:0%

04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
welcome commissioner edelblute and ask
 
04:11:40.830 --> 04:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.349 --> 04:11:44.359 align:start position:0%
mic not a problem so for the record my
 
04:11:46.030 --> 04:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
name is Frank GBL I'm the commissioner
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
of education for the Department of
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
Education um and you'll see that we have
 
04:11:53.590 --> 04:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
quite a hefty um packet of documentation
 
04:11:55.109 --> 04:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
here and I'm happy to leave this with
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
you but um what I have before me is I
 
04:12:01.070 --> 04:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
and I uh is a lot of information I'm not
 
04:12:02.950 --> 04:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
actually going to be reading all of it
 
04:12:06.510 --> 04:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
but I basically compiled um all of the
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
press releases and all of the op-eds
 
04:12:10.910 --> 04:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
that were written from the beginning of
 
04:12:12.510 --> 04:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
Co kind of leading all the way through
 
04:12:13.870 --> 04:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
just so that we can kind of Walk Through
 
04:12:16.469 --> 04:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
The Narrative of how this thing um you
 
04:12:18.149 --> 04:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
know evolved and how it
 
04:12:21.229 --> 04:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
unfolded um you know and again I just
 
04:12:22.710 --> 04:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
want to provide as much information as I
 
04:12:25.429 --> 04:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
can to you so that you'll have that um
 
04:12:27.990 --> 04:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
the one uh yeah so we'll just start
 
04:12:30.469 --> 04:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
there um and actually I'm
 
04:12:30.479 --> 04:12:32.630 align:start position:0%
there um and actually I'm
gonna

04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
04:12:34.750 --> 04:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
yes yeah this is all Department stuff
 
04:12:36.469 --> 04:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
all Department yes everything that
 
04:12:39.109 --> 04:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
associated with our agency so these are
 
04:12:40.590 --> 04:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
all press releases that we released as
 
04:12:42.670 --> 04:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
an agency and op-eds mostly that I wrote
 
04:12:45.550 --> 04:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
as an as a commissioner um I'm actually
 
04:12:46.630 --> 04:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
just going to start with a little bit of
 
04:12:48.510 --> 04:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
a timeline before the beginning of this
 
04:12:51.510 --> 04:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
but so because this the the co stuff hit
 
04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
our radar fairly early um relative to um
 
04:12:58.670 --> 04:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
kind of the general public so on January
 
04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
29th um before there was really any
 
04:13:04.590 --> 04:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
public conversation about covid-19 I
 
04:13:05.830 --> 04:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
don't even know that it was referred to
 
04:13:09.149 --> 04:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
as covid-19 at that time um there was
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
what is referred to as a health alert um
 
04:13:12.910 --> 04:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
that the which you guys are familiar
 
04:13:15.990 --> 04:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
with that HHS puts out um and we
 
04:13:18.149 --> 04:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
provided so on January 29th we provided
 
04:13:19.750 --> 04:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
the First Health alert relative to a
 
04:13:23.469 --> 04:13:23.479 align:start position:0%
respiratory viral disease uh to uh from
 
04:13:25.229 --> 04:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
HHS put it out we provided that to our
 
04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
school leaders um we followed up on
 
04:13:30.590 --> 04:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
February 3D with a webinar for school
 
04:13:33.349 --> 04:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
leaders um and public school offic
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
public health officials um you know in
 
04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to just describe to them
 
04:13:41.389 --> 04:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
you know what was going on um and then
 
04:13:43.550 --> 04:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
we provided you know from that point
 
04:13:45.550 --> 04:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
forward we were providing either weekly
 
04:13:49.189 --> 04:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
or multi- times a week uh updates to our
 
04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
schools just to kind of communicate to
 
04:13:53.070 --> 04:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
them and let them know what was going on
 
04:13:55.630 --> 04:13:55.640 align:start position:0%
um the the breadth of conversation that
 
04:13:58.630 --> 04:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
we um got ourselves involved in um was
 
04:14:02.030 --> 04:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
quite broad uh and so on March 10th as
 
04:14:03.870 --> 04:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
an example we issued a press release
 
04:14:06.189 --> 04:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with upcoming school trips uh
 
04:14:08.910 --> 04:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
because as you know many schools take uh
 
04:14:10.750 --> 04:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
field trips especially eighth graders
 
04:14:13.429 --> 04:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
take off for New York City or Washington
 
04:14:17.109 --> 04:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
DC and so uh we were providing
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
information and guidance relative to
 
04:14:21.109 --> 04:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
school trips starting as early as March
 
04:14:25.389 --> 04:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
10th um on March 12th uh we had a press
 
04:14:27.630 --> 04:14:27.640 align:start position:0%
release that announced um that the
 
04:14:31.070 --> 04:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
department had uh was seeking waivers
 
04:14:32.469 --> 04:14:32.479 align:start position:0%
for from the US Department of
 
04:14:34.910 --> 04:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
Agriculture relative to our food
 
04:14:37.469 --> 04:14:37.479 align:start position:0%
programming um and part of that related
 
04:14:40.309 --> 04:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
to uh how we were going to be providing
 
04:14:43.070 --> 04:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh food uh many of the USDA programs are
 
04:14:44.710 --> 04:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
pretty prescriptive in terms of how you
 
04:14:46.510 --> 04:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
can provide the food program most of it
 
04:14:48.189 --> 04:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
requireed that a student be present to
 
04:14:49.590 --> 04:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
be able to receive the food so we were
 
04:14:51.910 --> 04:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
seeking waivers uh that allowed a
 
04:14:53.189 --> 04:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
variety of different things and again
 
04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
I'll leave this whole package with you
 
04:14:58.030 --> 04:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
but um essentially uh would allow us to
 
04:14:59.510 --> 04:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
send food home with schools like I don't
 
04:15:00.630 --> 04:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
know if you know this but like today
 
04:15:02.990 --> 04:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
under your USDA regulations right if a
 
04:15:05.109 --> 04:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
kid takes an apple and puts it on their
 
04:15:06.990 --> 04:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
tray and then they try to leave the
 
04:15:08.550 --> 04:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
cafeteria they're not allowed to take
 
04:15:10.189 --> 04:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
the Apple out of the cafeteria and save
 
04:15:11.510 --> 04:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
it for a snack for later on they pretty
 
04:15:13.510 --> 04:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
much have to consume the food in the
 
04:15:14.750 --> 04:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
single setting so there's a lot of
 
04:15:16.429 --> 04:15:16.439 align:start position:0%
prescriptive rules so we were seeking
 
04:15:18.830 --> 04:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
waivers to those on March 13th so you
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
can see it was going pretty fast and
 
04:15:23.149 --> 04:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
furious at this point um I had a press
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
release commissioner updat schools on
 
04:15:29.070 --> 04:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
covid-19 response um and the way that it
 
04:15:30.790 --> 04:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
was characterized this is a letter that
 
04:15:33.550 --> 04:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
we sent out to school leaders um from a
 
04:15:35.630 --> 04:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
worst case um said that the public
 
04:15:37.750 --> 04:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
health orders for the closure of your of
 
04:15:39.429 --> 04:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
your facility right so at that point in
 
04:15:41.510 --> 04:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
time it was possible that public health
 
04:15:42.990 --> 04:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
might go to a particular school or
 
04:15:44.790 --> 04:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
School setting and order the closure of
 
04:15:47.269 --> 04:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
a of a facility they have the authority
 
04:15:50.349 --> 04:15:50.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that uh to a best case
 
04:15:52.630 --> 04:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
um you know for disruption assuming
 
04:15:54.590 --> 04:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
disruption and this was a concern that
 
04:15:56.710 --> 04:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
was happening at this time is that
 
04:15:58.710 --> 04:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
parents were beginning to refuse to send
 
04:16:00.189 --> 04:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
their students to school right so the
 
04:16:02.469 --> 04:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
parents were saying like too scary over
 
04:16:03.469 --> 04:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
there we're not going to allow our
 
04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
children to participate in school um and
 
04:16:09.269 --> 04:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
so on March 12th the State Board of
 
04:16:12.349 --> 04:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
Education had passed an emergency rule
 
04:16:14.550 --> 04:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh that allowed Stu allowed schools to
 
04:16:16.510 --> 04:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
conduct remote instruction if they saw
 
04:16:18.790 --> 04:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
fit so on March 12th that rule was um
 
04:16:20.670 --> 04:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
passed and on March 13th we communicated
 
04:16:23.389 --> 04:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
that information um in a relatively
 
04:16:26.910 --> 04:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
lengthy um you know uh letter to schools
 
04:16:28.229 --> 04:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of more information in
 
04:16:29.189 --> 04:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
there but I'm just trying to move
 
04:16:32.109 --> 04:16:32.119 align:start position:0%
through the um the the calendar uh on
 
04:16:34.630 --> 04:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
March 18th um we released so I'm going
 
04:16:36.030 --> 04:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
to think is that that would be like a
 
04:16:37.309 --> 04:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
Tuesday I don't have a calendar in front
 
04:16:39.429 --> 04:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
of me is that a Tuesday anybody March 18
 
04:16:43.269 --> 04:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
2020 because I seem to recall um I I
 
04:16:46.229 --> 04:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:51.149 --> 04:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:53.229 --> 04:16:53.239 align:start position:0%
18th was it the
 
04:17:00.790 --> 04:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:03.910 --> 04:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
Sunday 18th was a Wednesday so the 17th
 
04:17:06.429 --> 04:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
was a Tuesday so the 16th was a Monday
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
which is what I thought so on the 15th
 
04:17:10.710 --> 04:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
right okay so this was on that Wednesday
 
04:17:13.550 --> 04:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
um and so this was on Sunday day the
 
04:17:16.109 --> 04:17:16.119 align:start position:0%
15th is when we had you know first
 
04:17:19.389 --> 04:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
communicated out to the um schools about
 
04:17:22.269 --> 04:17:22.279 align:start position:0%
what we were going to be doing um I mean
 
04:17:24.429 --> 04:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
I can recall being at the uh Emergency
 
04:17:27.030 --> 04:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
Response Center that weekend and we sent
 
04:17:28.469 --> 04:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
out we collected data from
 
04:17:30.269 --> 04:17:30.279 align:start position:0%
superintendant across the state saying
 
04:17:31.750 --> 04:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
hey if we have to Pivot to remote what's
 
04:17:33.429 --> 04:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
this going to look like we created one
 
04:17:35.269 --> 04:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
of the first heat Maps relative to that
 
04:17:36.750 --> 04:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
and I think we presented that in a press
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
re press conference and we updated that
 
04:17:41.149 --> 04:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
a few weeks later so on this but by the
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
18th um and again I'm just just trying
 
04:17:45.870 --> 04:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
to uh give a sense as to what's going on
 
04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know we published something called
 
04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
healthy habits for well-being a resource
 
04:17:51.870 --> 04:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
for students parents and Educators for
 
04:17:53.910 --> 04:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
how to stay strong in the current
 
04:17:56.710 --> 04:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
anxious environment um and that was
 
04:18:01.149 --> 04:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
accompanied by an oped by me um which is
 
04:18:03.070 --> 04:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
which was really protecting Wellness as
 
04:18:06.109 --> 04:18:06.119 align:start position:0%
well as health um recognizing and I and
 
04:18:08.710 --> 04:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
and my point of really flagging this for
 
04:18:10.229 --> 04:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
you is that we knew that there were
 
04:18:12.269 --> 04:18:12.279 align:start position:0%
mental health issues associated with
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
public with something whatever action is
 
04:18:16.429 --> 04:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
going to be taken early on like so if
 
04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
somebody sort of imagines that that
 
04:18:19.870 --> 04:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
sneaks up on you but it was like how to
 
04:18:22.910 --> 04:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
take care of you you know checking in
 
04:18:24.710 --> 04:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
engaging with other people learning how
 
04:18:26.910 --> 04:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
to rela like relax go for a walk work in
 
04:18:31.349 --> 04:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
your garden whatever um on on March 19th
 
04:18:34.590 --> 04:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
um there was uh in the news answering
 
04:18:36.429 --> 04:18:36.439 align:start position:0%
your questions about covid-19 so this
 
04:18:39.269 --> 04:18:39.279 align:start position:0%
was a oped that I put out uh answering
 
04:18:41.389 --> 04:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
some of the most common questions we've
 
04:18:42.950 --> 04:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
received as the Department of Education
 
04:18:46.630 --> 04:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
relative to this um in terms of how uh
 
04:18:48.670 --> 04:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
you know instructional days will count
 
04:18:50.149 --> 04:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
what are we going to be doing New
 
04:18:51.710 --> 04:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was in a unique position
 
04:18:53.389 --> 04:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
compared to many of other states uh
 
04:18:55.710 --> 04:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic many other states
 
04:19:00.149 --> 04:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
had a um a significant uh issue because
 
04:19:02.229 --> 04:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
they in their state law require that
 
04:19:05.349 --> 04:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
students attend school for 180 days a
 
04:19:07.389 --> 04:19:07.399 align:start position:0%
year New Hampshire does not have that
 
04:19:09.630 --> 04:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
law New Hampshire law states that
 
04:19:11.070 --> 04:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
schools are required to provide
 
04:19:13.309 --> 04:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
instruction to students for 18 80 days a
 
04:19:14.870 --> 04:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
year students are supposed to be
 
04:19:16.910 --> 04:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
advancing on Mastery right if a kid
 
04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
knows the material we're not supposed to
 
04:19:20.469 --> 04:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
like be locking them up um and so we
 
04:19:22.469 --> 04:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
were just clarifying that that you know
 
04:19:24.510 --> 04:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
different questions about special
 
04:19:24.520 --> 04:19:25.950 align:start position:0%
different questions about special
education

04:19:25.950 --> 04:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:19:28.990 --> 04:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
students um you know teachers coming in
 
04:19:31.229 --> 04:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
will part-time and contract School staff
 
04:19:33.670 --> 04:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
be paid you know how will schools know
 
04:19:35.750 --> 04:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
that audio and video uh conferencing
 
04:19:38.910 --> 04:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
apps comply with uh privacy regulations
 
04:19:40.469 --> 04:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
how are working parents supposed to care
 
04:19:42.790 --> 04:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
for school a children if they can't miss
 
04:19:45.389 --> 04:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
work uh can families receive School
 
04:19:47.550 --> 04:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
breakfasts and lunches how long does
 
04:19:49.510 --> 04:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
covid-19 survive on paper and other
 
04:19:52.149 --> 04:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
materials how are lowincome families and
 
04:19:53.670 --> 04:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
families in areas without Broadband
 
04:19:56.790 --> 04:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
going to access instruction so trying to
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
um address a lot of the concerns that
 
04:20:01.269 --> 04:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
was on so just imagine that was on that
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
Thursday of the first week right that
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
we're pushing that information out so um
 
04:20:08.550 --> 04:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
so the next thing on April 1st a little
 
04:20:10.950 --> 04:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
bit later I wrote an oped it's called um
 
04:20:13.630 --> 04:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
CTE students and graduates are ready to
 
04:20:15.870 --> 04:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
serve and equipped to succeed right so
 
04:20:18.429 --> 04:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
keep in mind we're still in our first uh
 
04:20:23.309 --> 04:20:23.319 align:start position:0%
twoe um you know uh flatten the curve
 
04:20:27.149 --> 04:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
period And I um I put out an oped and uh
 
04:20:28.429 --> 04:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
I took a little bit of flack on this one
 
04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
but it said like and you're welcome to
 
04:20:32.030 --> 04:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
read it later but so the Career and
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
Technical education programs in the
 
04:20:36.109 --> 04:20:36.119 align:start position:0%
state prepare students across the state
 
04:20:39.670 --> 04:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
with skills to this very moment and what
 
04:20:42.109 --> 04:20:42.119 align:start position:0%
the conversations I was having well and
 
04:20:44.149 --> 04:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
I'll just some another line in here is
 
04:20:45.550 --> 04:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
like you know throughout history our
 
04:20:47.590 --> 04:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
young our young people have stepped up
 
04:20:50.990 --> 04:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
in times of Crisis and I really U was I
 
04:20:54.070 --> 04:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
felt like we were um you know and you'll
 
04:20:58.349 --> 04:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
see the the the messaging here was that
 
04:21:00.389 --> 04:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
these are young kids who are resilient
 
04:21:02.189 --> 04:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
strong young kids I mean and think about
 
04:21:04.469 --> 04:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
like World War I World War II these were
 
04:21:06.590 --> 04:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
Salient moments in the lives of many of
 
04:21:08.870 --> 04:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
these kids there's a national crisis and
 
04:21:11.149 --> 04:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
the young people step in to provide
 
04:21:14.469 --> 04:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
support and defense um and so you know
 
04:21:16.349 --> 04:21:16.359 align:start position:0%
we I talked about our health science
 
04:21:18.429 --> 04:21:18.439 align:start position:0%
students should be able to engage and be
 
04:21:20.309 --> 04:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
able to do stuff our emergency medical
 
04:21:22.469 --> 04:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
technicians and fire rescue these are
 
04:21:24.389 --> 04:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
people who are able to respond our
 
04:21:25.950 --> 04:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
construction trades at the time I don't
 
04:21:26.950 --> 04:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
know if you remember we were building
 
04:21:29.830 --> 04:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
hospital beds in in open places uh you
 
04:21:31.590 --> 04:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
know automotive and diesel mechanics
 
04:21:33.269 --> 04:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
keeping the supply chain working
 
04:21:36.870 --> 04:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
culinary arts kids preparing meals um
 
04:21:38.309 --> 04:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
and kind of what I what I thought was
 
04:21:39.429 --> 04:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
the money line I don't know if it worked
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
or not but um you know through this
 
04:21:43.550 --> 04:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
programming these students and graduates
 
04:21:45.389 --> 04:21:45.399 align:start position:0%
have demonstrated that they are ready to
 
04:21:48.309 --> 04:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
serve and equipped to succeed right so
 
04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
just trying to uh not uh create an
 
04:21:54.990 --> 04:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
environment of fear but create an
 
04:21:57.630 --> 04:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
environment of of uh you know would it's
 
04:21:59.429 --> 04:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
not the first national crisis that you
 
04:22:01.229 --> 04:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
know um had been faced and again you got
 
04:22:02.790 --> 04:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
to put yourself back in that context so
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
that um maybe these uh students are are
 
04:22:08.469 --> 04:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
the future right it's and give them an
 
04:22:11.790 --> 04:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity here um on April 6 I secured
 
04:22:14.429 --> 04:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
a waiver uh for School meals that we're
 
04:22:15.990 --> 04:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
going to allow them to serve meals
 
04:22:17.389 --> 04:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
through the April
 
04:22:20.469 --> 04:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
vacation um and then on April 16th
 
04:22:22.630 --> 04:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
another letter to Educators this is the
 
04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
letter that uh came because we went from
 
04:22:29.790 --> 04:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
our second um two week uh flatten to the
 
04:22:31.349 --> 04:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
flatten the curve to it's going to last
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
till the end of the year um and so uh
 
04:22:38.510 --> 04:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
you know um at the time uh you know the
 
04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
focus was on really um that this is kind
 
04:22:43.309 --> 04:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
of a it turns out not as sprinting
 
04:22:44.429 --> 04:22:44.439 align:start position:0%
through this right because when we first
 
04:22:46.309 --> 04:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
did the first two weeks then the second
 
04:22:47.550 --> 04:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
two weeks everybody's like okay we can
 
04:22:49.389 --> 04:22:49.399 align:start position:0%
hold our breath for that long right and
 
04:22:51.109 --> 04:22:51.119 align:start position:0%
then really the pivot was about that
 
04:22:52.670 --> 04:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
this it turns out is a marathon not a
 
04:22:54.189 --> 04:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
Sprint in terms of what potentially is
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
going to happen if it's going to last
 
04:22:57.189 --> 04:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
through the rest of the year and just
 
04:23:00.149 --> 04:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
emphasizing that uh you know we're going
 
04:23:01.670 --> 04:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
to have to continue through this but
 
04:23:04.189 --> 04:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
that school is in session like don't
 
04:23:05.790 --> 04:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
we're not like this is not a go home and
 
04:23:08.429 --> 04:23:08.439 align:start position:0%
not do anything and truthfully and we
 
04:23:10.189 --> 04:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
did receive um some praise nationally
 
04:23:12.990 --> 04:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
about this kind of a philosophy but
 
04:23:14.830 --> 04:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know we pivoted over to remote
 
04:23:17.229 --> 04:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
instruction like the philosophy that we
 
04:23:18.550 --> 04:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
have as an agency is that kids are
 
04:23:20.030 --> 04:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
learning all the time right so these
 
04:23:21.630 --> 04:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
kids if we just sent these kids home
 
04:23:23.109 --> 04:23:23.119 align:start position:0%
they were going to be learning things
 
04:23:24.149 --> 04:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
but it might be stuff that we don't
 
04:23:26.070 --> 04:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
actually want them to be working on um
 
04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
and remote instruction at least afforded
 
04:23:29.189 --> 04:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
us the opportunity to be able to weigh
 
04:23:30.630 --> 04:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
in on what it is that they were going to
 
04:23:32.070 --> 04:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
be learning if they're not with us and
 
04:23:34.670 --> 04:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
so recognizing that stud you don't get
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
to like sending the kids home didn't
 
04:23:38.950 --> 04:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
shut off student learning sending the
 
04:23:41.109 --> 04:23:41.119 align:start position:0%
kids home might have shut off our input
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
into what they were going to be learning
 
04:23:44.030 --> 04:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
um but it certainly wouldn't have shut
 
04:23:47.229 --> 04:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
off learning um on May 1st um so this is
 
04:23:50.830 --> 04:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
another two weeks later so uh um at a
 
04:23:52.990 --> 04:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
release about applying lessons of remote
 
04:23:54.910 --> 04:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
instruction when we go back to school so
 
04:23:56.750 --> 04:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
we already talking about Okay so we've
 
04:23:58.750 --> 04:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
been in remote instruction at this point
 
04:24:02.469 --> 04:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
in time for about five weeks um and uh
 
04:24:04.670 --> 04:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
just describing some of those
 
04:24:06.630 --> 04:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
experiences and I I told a story about a
 
04:24:09.189 --> 04:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
couple of students about Leslie uh these
 
04:24:11.670 --> 04:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
are they madeup names who had a really
 
04:24:13.349 --> 04:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
hard time with right she misses her
 
04:24:15.590 --> 04:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
friends in her extracurricular programs
 
04:24:17.189 --> 04:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
the instruction is okay but I miss my
 
04:24:18.870 --> 04:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
friends I miss my sports and this was a
 
04:24:20.030 --> 04:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
young it's a true story about a young
 
04:24:21.550 --> 04:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
lady who was very into the sports and
 
04:24:23.070 --> 04:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
she's like oh my gosh I can't do my
 
04:24:25.429 --> 04:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
sports right and then another one is a
 
04:24:28.030 --> 04:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
you know a young lady named Melanie who
 
04:24:31.149 --> 04:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
felt she was now engaging her material
 
04:24:32.990 --> 04:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
more than ever um was the feedback that
 
04:24:34.510 --> 04:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
we got from both her her parents as well
 
04:24:38.109 --> 04:24:38.119 align:start position:0%
as the schools um she uh you know
 
04:24:39.870 --> 04:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
basically could do stuff at her own pace
 
04:24:41.510 --> 04:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
right and engage it on her own terms and
 
04:24:43.469 --> 04:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
so she happened to somebody who had a
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
job at a pizza parlor her job was
 
04:24:47.590 --> 04:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
continuing um and so she could engage
 
04:24:51.109 --> 04:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
her curriculum in a more flexible way um
 
04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
and so um you know with the Academic
 
04:24:56.429 --> 04:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
Year almost over we are the idear here
 
04:24:59.109 --> 04:24:59.119 align:start position:0%
is we're already planning for the fall
 
04:25:00.990 --> 04:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
so with this Academic Year almost over
 
04:25:03.389 --> 04:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
we're already planting fall and a new
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
meaning of back to school we need to
 
04:25:07.550 --> 04:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
learn what this per learn what this
 
04:25:09.149 --> 04:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
period of remote instruction has to
 
04:25:11.389 --> 04:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
teach us well it is appropriate that we
 
04:25:13.349 --> 04:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
consider learning Gap gaps for students
 
04:25:15.550 --> 04:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
that may have manifest as a result of
 
04:25:17.830 --> 04:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
covid-19 uh the persistent and
 
04:25:20.429 --> 04:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
inequitable learning gaps existed before
 
04:25:22.790 --> 04:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and so I guess my point here is
 
04:25:24.670 --> 04:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
like again early like everybody goes oh
 
04:25:26.550 --> 04:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
my gosh there's learning gaps like you
 
04:25:27.910 --> 04:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
know we were talking about learning gaps
 
04:25:30.830 --> 04:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
on May 1 of the first year saying like
 
04:25:32.830 --> 04:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
this is learning gaps are not new
 
04:25:34.189 --> 04:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
they're existing they're being P you
 
04:25:36.590 --> 04:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
know they're being examplified by uh
 
04:25:39.109 --> 04:25:39.119 align:start position:0%
covid you know um you know and we talk
 
04:25:40.750 --> 04:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
about the mental health issues again pre
 
04:25:42.469 --> 04:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
pandemic teens Su you know so pre-
 
04:25:44.790 --> 04:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic we had learning gaps you know
 
04:25:46.630 --> 04:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
pre pandemic we had teen suicide
 
04:25:48.149 --> 04:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
substance misuse and a host of other
 
04:25:49.830 --> 04:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
mental health issues were on the rise at
 
04:25:52.590 --> 04:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
reach and reaching alarming issues um
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
Paul lean LeBlanc for the president of
 
04:25:57.910 --> 04:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh SN had a quote there he says American
 
04:25:59.670 --> 04:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
higher education cannot respond to the
 
04:26:02.030 --> 04:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
crisis with a calcified industrial
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
production model of learning um and this
 
04:26:07.309 --> 04:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
same approach applies to our K12 system
 
04:26:10.710 --> 04:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
um on May 11th uh we had uh announced
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
our we called it the school transition
 
04:26:16.469 --> 04:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
reopening and redesign task force start
 
04:26:17.950 --> 04:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
um it was a group that we pulled
 
04:26:19.630 --> 04:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
together to figure out okay so how we
 
04:26:20.950 --> 04:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
going to get these kids back into school
 
04:26:22.590 --> 04:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
what is that going to look like uh the
 
04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
title of the release is back to school
 
04:26:28.269 --> 04:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
um on May 27th parents uh we had a
 
04:26:31.189 --> 04:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
survey that we released um you know open
 
04:26:33.429 --> 04:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
to everybody uh that survey ultimately
 
04:26:36.429 --> 04:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
collected over 56,000 responses from
 
04:26:38.189 --> 04:26:38.199 align:start position:0%
across the state I think to this dat it
 
04:26:40.910 --> 04:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
might be the uh a survey that has more
 
04:26:42.870 --> 04:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
responsive than any survey survey in the
 
04:26:46.149 --> 04:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
history of New Hampshire um on June 4th
 
04:26:47.950 --> 04:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
we received our first allocation and we
 
04:26:51.070 --> 04:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
distributed $ 33.4 million in cares
 
04:26:54.670 --> 04:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
funds acts um to schools to be able to
 
04:26:56.590 --> 04:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
uh work on mitigation and education
 
04:26:59.269 --> 04:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
issues um on June 12th I got another
 
04:27:00.990 --> 04:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
extension associated with the meal
 
04:27:04.309 --> 04:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
waiver on June 19th uh the state issued
 
04:27:06.349 --> 04:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
guidance for in school summer programs
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
right because we have a lot of esy
 
04:27:09.750 --> 04:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
students uh extended school year
 
04:27:12.670 --> 04:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
students and um so we worked very hard
 
04:27:15.950 --> 04:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
on that guidance for students with uh in
 
04:27:17.550 --> 04:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
particular most of the summer much of
 
04:27:18.910 --> 04:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
the summer program is centered around
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
students with special education needs um
 
04:27:23.710 --> 04:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of difficulty so
 
04:27:26.750 --> 04:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
some of these are students who have um
 
04:27:28.149 --> 04:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
needs like you know they've got
 
04:27:29.870 --> 04:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
particular types of autism they're not
 
04:27:31.469 --> 04:27:31.479 align:start position:0%
capable of wearing a mask they're not
 
04:27:33.389 --> 04:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
capable of you know uh certain
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
mitigation protocols simply not going to
 
04:27:38.910 --> 04:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
happen um you know they they have um you
 
04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
know issues relative to bodily fluids
 
04:27:42.429 --> 04:27:42.439 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that so a lot of of
 
04:27:44.750 --> 04:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
technical questions about how to manage
 
04:27:47.429 --> 04:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
students with high need medical issues
 
04:27:48.750 --> 04:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
um that would be entering into some of
 
04:27:51.750 --> 04:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
that summer programming um and so we we
 
04:27:54.229 --> 04:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time doing on that um on
 
04:27:56.229 --> 04:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
June 19th because a lot of kids were
 
04:27:57.990 --> 04:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
disrupted I wrote an opet about don't
 
04:28:00.790 --> 04:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
let covid-19 derail your college plans
 
04:28:02.389 --> 04:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
about and kind of just laying out
 
04:28:04.389 --> 04:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
Pathways for students like you don't
 
04:28:06.070 --> 04:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
have to put your life on hold here right
 
04:28:09.070 --> 04:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
like we get to keep moving forward um is
 
04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
I think you know I share that one with
 
04:28:11.910 --> 04:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
you on that in that context and again
 
04:28:13.229 --> 04:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
there's lots of details you can go
 
04:28:15.389 --> 04:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
through and you can read them um on July
 
04:28:19.109 --> 04:28:19.119 align:start position:0%
1 uh you know iing uh we um talked about
 
04:28:20.950 --> 04:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
equipping teachers to help students
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
returning from remote instruction right
 
04:28:24.670 --> 04:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
so now they're going to be back so on
 
04:28:28.510 --> 04:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
July 1 we're already here we we released
 
04:28:30.070 --> 04:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
some training programs we worked with an
 
04:28:31.830 --> 04:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
organization called cast who has a
 
04:28:33.189 --> 04:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
program called Universal Design for
 
04:28:37.189 --> 04:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
Learning uh to basically recognize so
 
04:28:39.030 --> 04:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
Universal Design for Learning recognizes
 
04:28:40.469 --> 04:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
and when kids come into your learning
 
04:28:41.630 --> 04:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
environment they're at all different
 
04:28:44.189 --> 04:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
levels and so given the fact that we had
 
04:28:46.590 --> 04:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
just spent from you know March 16th
 
04:28:48.030 --> 04:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
until the end of the school year at that
 
04:28:49.429 --> 04:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
we imagined that there would be a lot of
 
04:28:51.630 --> 04:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
variability or an amplified variability
 
04:28:54.109 --> 04:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
among those students uh so we provided
 
04:28:55.990 --> 04:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
free training training programs to
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
teachers to say like okay so what are
 
04:28:59.590 --> 04:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
the strategies I'm going to use for
 
04:29:00.990 --> 04:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
instruction when these kids come back to
 
04:29:02.469 --> 04:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
us and I got a room full of kids that
 
04:29:04.269 --> 04:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
now the standard deviation of learning
 
04:29:07.469 --> 04:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
is is far greater um on July 10th
 
04:29:09.229 --> 04:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
setting realistic expectations for
 
04:29:12.590 --> 04:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
school reopening um and so again we had
 
04:29:14.950 --> 04:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
collected uh you know um throughout the
 
04:29:17.109 --> 04:29:17.119 align:start position:0%
summer we had our start thing we
 
04:29:20.830 --> 04:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
collected 56,000 responses and the tone
 
04:29:23.630 --> 04:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
here so again the the the title might
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
bury the lead really where it
 
04:29:28.790 --> 04:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
says uh setting realistic expectations
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
for school
 
04:29:32.269 --> 04:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
reopening um and I'll just read a couple
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
of paragraphs from this oped it said
 
04:29:36.710 --> 04:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
when we return to school we will need to
 
04:29:38.630 --> 04:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
be realistic about our expectations for
 
04:29:41.469 --> 04:29:41.479 align:start position:0%
a couple of reasons first it is unlikely
 
04:29:43.590 --> 04:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
that children even some of the older
 
04:29:45.630 --> 04:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
ones will follow our wellth thought out
 
04:29:48.149 --> 04:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
plans exactly as imagined they are
 
04:29:50.910 --> 04:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
children that is not a flaw um we also
 
04:29:53.469 --> 04:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
need to recognize the negative effect on
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
those same children of an overly
 
04:29:57.510 --> 04:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
constrained environment children are
 
04:29:59.389 --> 04:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
designed to be curious Learners and
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
explorers stifling that Curiosity also
 
04:30:04.109 --> 04:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
has Health consequences to our children
 
04:30:05.950 --> 04:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
and I do not want us to lose sight of
 
04:30:08.670 --> 04:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
that right so recognizing you know just
 
04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
because you think you've mitigated the
 
04:30:13.269 --> 04:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh the the spiral disease doesn't mean
 
04:30:16.189 --> 04:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
that you've not created an alternative
 
04:30:20.189 --> 04:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
um otogenic type of a of a problem um
 
04:30:23.429 --> 04:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
and so then on July 15 uh another news
 
04:30:25.630 --> 04:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
release about we've come a long way it
 
04:30:28.510 --> 04:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
was an oped actually and I talk about
 
04:30:30.630 --> 04:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
you know how we started on January 29th
 
04:30:32.229 --> 04:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
which I talked about on February 3rd and
 
04:30:33.429 --> 04:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
all the kind of
 
04:30:35.670 --> 04:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
communications um but I basically am you
 
04:30:37.429 --> 04:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
know St today we're in a very different
 
04:30:38.950 --> 04:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
place from where we were you know on
 
04:30:41.229 --> 04:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
March 15th uh the governor issued the
 
04:30:42.910 --> 04:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
first emergency order temporary remote
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
instruction uh for public districts
 
04:30:46.149 --> 04:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
today we're in a very different place we
 
04:30:47.630 --> 04:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
have vastly more knowledge and
 
04:30:50.389 --> 04:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
information about this disease um all of
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
this knowledge among other inputs has
 
04:30:54.429 --> 04:30:54.439 align:start position:0%
gone into our plan to safely reopen
 
04:30:56.670 --> 04:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
schools in September we can now safely
 
04:30:58.149 --> 04:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
conduct in-person instruction and
 
04:30:59.830 --> 04:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
provide accommodations for students and
 
04:31:01.469 --> 04:31:01.479 align:start position:0%
staff with underlying health risk and
 
04:31:01.479 --> 04:31:02.510 align:start position:0%
staff with underlying health risk and
create

04:31:02.510 --> 04:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
create
 
04:31:05.269 --> 04:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities um but each City and
 
04:31:06.910 --> 04:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
each City and town in New Hampshire can
 
04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
craft a safe and effective return to
 
04:31:10.229 --> 04:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
school we are not the first to travel
 
04:31:11.710 --> 04:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
down this road even at that time I don't
 
04:31:13.750 --> 04:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
know if if you all know it but um 20
 
04:31:15.550 --> 04:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
countries have already opened
 
04:31:17.109 --> 04:31:17.119 align:start position:0%
educational institutions by that you
 
04:31:18.309 --> 04:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
know if you looked around the globe and
 
04:31:19.469 --> 04:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
you could see what was kind of going on
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
there so we knew where that was going um
 
04:31:26.910 --> 04:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
so on August 14th um doe publishes five
 
04:31:29.389 --> 04:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
steps to covid card it's basically five
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
steps to expect if your student or staff
 
04:31:33.030 --> 04:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
member test positive for covid just
 
04:31:35.070 --> 04:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
explaining to people you know how this
 
04:31:37.309 --> 04:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
process would work again you can read
 
04:31:39.229 --> 04:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
through this students with IEPs need
 
04:31:41.349 --> 04:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
full support so this was an interesting
 
04:31:43.389 --> 04:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
oped I wrote with a a woman named
 
04:31:44.990 --> 04:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
Stephanie Patrick who some of you may
 
04:31:46.510 --> 04:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
know she works for the disab rights
 
04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
Center um and we were having difficulty
 
04:31:53.070 --> 04:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know students with disabilities
 
04:31:54.510 --> 04:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
were still having trouble getting a hold
 
04:31:56.830 --> 04:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
of uh you know some of the services that
 
04:31:58.830 --> 04:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
they they needed and and many of these
 
04:32:01.389 --> 04:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
students some of our most vulnerable in
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
the state made little or no progress and
 
04:32:06.670 --> 04:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
in some cases regressed during the
 
04:32:08.590 --> 04:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
initial remote instruction and support
 
04:32:10.229 --> 04:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
period this spring and that cannot
 
04:32:12.910 --> 04:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
continue is what I've written you know
 
04:32:14.510 --> 04:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
reading another paragraph while some
 
04:32:16.149 --> 04:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
schools may have adopted a hybrid or
 
04:32:17.550 --> 04:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
remote instructional model for the Fall
 
04:32:19.149 --> 04:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
start many of the students with IEPs
 
04:32:21.429 --> 04:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
require imperson supports and services
 
04:32:23.630 --> 04:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
that simply cannot be provided remotely
 
04:32:26.189 --> 04:32:26.199 align:start position:0%
remotely there are no prohibitions on
 
04:32:28.469 --> 04:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
our districts by Pro to providing these
 
04:32:30.630 --> 04:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
in-person Services again you know going
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
back into the you know late June we
 
04:32:35.590 --> 04:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
provided guidance for how to do that um
 
04:32:37.990 --> 04:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
a coalition of educational associations
 
04:32:40.429 --> 04:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
went so far as to suggest the best time
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
to consider compensatory education
 
04:32:44.750 --> 04:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
supports and services is after the
 
04:32:47.189 --> 04:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic subsides we could not disagree
 
04:32:48.389 --> 04:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
more and you have to understand like
 
04:32:49.990 --> 04:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
when Stephanie and I disag agree on
 
04:32:50.910 --> 04:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
something this is kind of like
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
Monumental it's a good thing right um
 
04:32:55.109 --> 04:32:55.119 align:start position:0%
you know these responses are neither
 
04:32:57.070 --> 04:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate nor legal when planning for
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
the educational programming of students
 
04:33:00.349 --> 04:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
with disabilities so just weighing in on
 
04:33:02.030 --> 04:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
the importance of making sure that that
 
04:33:04.789 --> 04:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
happens on September 1st uh the New
 
04:33:07.551 --> 04:33:07.561 align:start position:0%
Hampshire schools um will soon receive
 
04:33:09.910 --> 04:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
we received an allocation of
 
04:33:13.189 --> 04:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
230,000 cloth face masks as part of a
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
nationwide program uh that distributed
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
over 125 million uh cloth masks to
 
04:33:20.189 --> 04:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
American public and private schools
 
04:33:21.629 --> 04:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
across the state so that was on
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
September 1st um that we received those
 
04:33:27.070 --> 04:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
and and distributed those back out um
 
04:33:30.230 --> 04:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
those were from the CDC so it was the
 
04:33:31.551 --> 04:33:31.561 align:start position:0%
the US Department of Health and Human
 
04:33:35.070 --> 04:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
Services allocated the 230,000 Mass to
 
04:33:36.750 --> 04:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we worked with the New
 
04:33:39.230 --> 04:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire guard to get those distributed
 
04:33:41.390 --> 04:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
um on September 10th we allocated
 
04:33:43.949 --> 04:33:43.959 align:start position:0%
additional $7 million to VX uh which is
 
04:33:46.590 --> 04:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
a virtual Learning Academy so uh you
 
04:33:47.990 --> 04:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
know because what we found is that many
 
04:33:50.510 --> 04:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
of the students uh were not interested
 
04:33:52.670 --> 04:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
in coming back uh at that time but we
 
04:33:53.709 --> 04:33:53.719 align:start position:0%
need to make sure they keep getting
 
04:33:56.189 --> 04:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
educated and so there was a a a quite a
 
04:33:58.590 --> 04:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
large surge that was going on relative
 
04:34:00.910 --> 04:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
to VX um as well many of the schools
 
04:34:02.510 --> 04:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
that did open up and had families that
 
04:34:05.429 --> 04:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
did not want to return to school um
 
04:34:07.230 --> 04:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
those families uh the schools would be
 
04:34:10.269 --> 04:34:10.279 align:start position:0%
able to point them towards um VX on
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
September 30th staying connected with
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
remote Learners um we provided an
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
infographic to assist New Hampshire
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
Educators to keep tabs on their students
 
04:34:18.510 --> 04:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
that were learning from home because we
 
04:34:19.869 --> 04:34:19.879 align:start position:0%
still had some students didn't want to
 
04:34:22.429 --> 04:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
come in they were learning from home um
 
04:34:24.590 --> 04:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
because we saw a sharp drop off of
 
04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
contact by student support functions and
 
04:34:28.590 --> 04:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to help support them to stay
 
04:34:30.029 --> 04:34:30.039 align:start position:0%
connected with those students even
 
04:34:31.150 --> 04:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
though they're learning
 
04:34:36.029 --> 04:34:36.039 align:start position:0%
remotely um on January 7th we got $156
 
04:34:38.990 --> 04:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
million um on January
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
14th um this is we rolled out a program
 
04:34:44.470 --> 04:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
our first in nation we worked with salon
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
and we rolled out a tutoring program
 
04:34:48.510 --> 04:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
with school house. world uh first
 
04:34:51.470 --> 04:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
program in the country on that one um
 
04:34:53.949 --> 04:34:53.959 align:start position:0%
then we got the 156 million first they
 
04:34:55.109 --> 04:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
told us we would get then they sent it
 
04:34:58.670 --> 04:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
to us we passed it out on February 17th
 
04:35:00.910 --> 04:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh new federal guidance related to the
 
04:35:03.670 --> 04:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
operation of New Hampshire schools um
 
04:35:06.670 --> 04:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
cdc's new educational phase mitigation
 
04:35:08.830 --> 04:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
guidance and suggested testing strategy
 
04:35:11.709 --> 04:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
would Place unnecessary barriers to
 
04:35:13.029 --> 04:35:13.039 align:start position:0%
inperson learning so this was a
 
04:35:15.349 --> 04:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
statement from Dr Chan and myself uh
 
04:35:18.150 --> 04:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
pushing back on um you know some of the
 
04:35:21.230 --> 04:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
CDC um probably one of the first uh you
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
know beginning to see some some daylight
 
04:35:25.269 --> 04:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
in there pushing back on some of that
 
04:35:29.750 --> 04:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
CDC stuff uh then on don't see a date
 
04:35:32.269 --> 04:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
here but I think it was in March we
 
04:35:35.510 --> 04:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
received another $350 million uh of Co
 
04:35:36.869 --> 04:35:36.879 align:start position:0%
relief funds so that brought the total
 
04:35:39.390 --> 04:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
so we were about $650 million of
 
04:35:40.789 --> 04:35:40.799 align:start position:0%
additional funds that went into the
 
04:35:44.750 --> 04:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
system um on April 12th uh we B I wrote
 
04:35:46.789 --> 04:35:46.799 align:start position:0%
an opportunity and I wrote an oped
 
04:35:50.349 --> 04:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
called an opportunity for change um and
 
04:35:54.269 --> 04:35:54.279 align:start position:0%
I the the the um the last sentence in
 
04:35:56.830 --> 04:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
the oped again money line says uh the P
 
04:35:58.269 --> 04:35:58.279 align:start position:0%
this pandemic has given us all a bunch
 
04:36:00.310 --> 04:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
of lemons is anyone interested in making
 
04:36:03.150 --> 04:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
lemonade um because I am a little bit
 
04:36:05.789 --> 04:36:05.799 align:start position:0%
optimistic um on April 15th New Hamshire
 
04:36:07.070 --> 04:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education announces
 
04:36:08.789 --> 04:36:08.799 align:start position:0%
support for districts to provide
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
additional services to students with
 
04:36:13.629 --> 04:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
disabilities uh so we actually provided
 
04:36:15.869 --> 04:36:15.879 align:start position:0%
uh $1.8 million of funding for any
 
04:36:17.510 --> 04:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
compensatory services that students with
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%
disabilities might need and made that
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
available to everybody um on June 9th uh
 
04:36:25.510 --> 04:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Education
 
04:36:27.189 --> 04:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
division of public health issues joint
 
04:36:30.629 --> 04:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
statement regarding masks in schools um
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
and says uh you know with the levels of
 
04:36:35.551 --> 04:36:35.561 align:start position:0%
covid-19 in our communities decreasing
 
04:36:36.830 --> 04:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
around the state New Hampshire division
 
04:36:38.590 --> 04:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
of Public Health recommended last week
 
04:36:40.510 --> 04:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
that schools can safely remove masks and
 
04:36:42.029 --> 04:36:42.039 align:start position:0%
outdoor settings regarding L of a
 
04:36:46.310 --> 04:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
person's vaccination status yep that was
 
04:36:48.869 --> 04:36:48.879 align:start position:0%
June 9th 2021 and I'll leave this whole
 
04:36:50.269 --> 04:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
packet for
 
04:36:52.150 --> 04:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
you yeah go
 
04:36:55.670 --> 04:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
ahead oops sorry now I'm forgetting so
 
04:36:58.709 --> 04:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
in September when um in September when
 
04:37:01.429 --> 04:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
the September 10th or whatever in 2020
 
04:37:03.070 --> 04:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
when the schools went back that was kind
 
04:37:05.349 --> 04:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
of where you said 230,000 masks were
 
04:37:08.310 --> 04:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
distributed um at that point how many
 
04:37:10.789 --> 04:37:10.799 align:start position:0%
schools were open do you know that data
 
04:37:12.150 --> 04:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
I can probably go back back and collect
 
04:37:14.150 --> 04:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
it I don't have that now with me because
 
04:37:15.629 --> 04:37:15.639 align:start position:0%
there was still a a whole bunch of
 
04:37:17.390 --> 04:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
schools that were not open there were
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
schools that were not open there were
 
04:37:20.109 --> 04:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
schools that were in hybrid as well and
 
04:37:21.150 --> 04:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
then there were schools that were fully
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
open correct okay yeah exactly
 
04:37:28.109 --> 04:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
um okay and so just emphasizing there
 
04:37:29.551 --> 04:37:29.561 align:start position:0%
should be flexibility in school Mass
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
policies so that if the situations
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
arrive we need to take care of that um
 
04:37:35.750 --> 04:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
on June 16th we released uh two million
 
04:37:37.230 --> 04:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
dollars for what is referred to the yes
 
04:37:39.670 --> 04:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
every student program um this was
 
04:37:42.990 --> 04:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
basically provided you know scholarship
 
04:37:45.750 --> 04:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
up to um a thousand dollars for students
 
04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
to just go out and hire tutors to be
 
04:37:49.910 --> 04:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
able to support them um if they were
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
behind in school um and then on June
 
04:37:55.230 --> 04:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
22nd um we released I didn't I'm
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
surprised we didn't have a release on
 
04:37:57.949 --> 04:37:57.959 align:start position:0%
this but we had announced our recovering
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
curiosity program so we provided grants
 
04:38:01.990 --> 04:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
we're in our fourth year now uh every
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
kid goes to camp um I'll take a I will
 
04:38:06.590 --> 04:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
pause for a moment or take a side detour
 
04:38:07.590 --> 04:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
and just talk about that program because
 
04:38:09.230 --> 04:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
it was one of my favorite but it I think
 
04:38:10.590 --> 04:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
it we tries to reflect what we were
 
04:38:13.310 --> 04:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish in New Hampshire um
 
04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
so every kid goes to camp rekindling
 
04:38:16.869 --> 04:38:16.879 align:start position:0%
curiosity was a program that came out of
 
04:38:19.709 --> 04:38:19.719 align:start position:0%
conversations I had with a lot of um you
 
04:38:21.470 --> 04:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
know National calls with school leaders
 
04:38:22.551 --> 04:38:22.561 align:start position:0%
and everybody was talking about the
 
04:38:24.109 --> 04:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
learning loss and saying like oh my gosh
 
04:38:27.189 --> 04:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
and um and and I'm not diminishing the
 
04:38:29.070 --> 04:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
learning loss uh but they were making
 
04:38:30.551 --> 04:38:30.561 align:start position:0%
recommendations of how we had to have
 
04:38:32.269 --> 04:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
extended school days we wanted to do
 
04:38:33.551 --> 04:38:33.561 align:start position:0%
summer school and we had to have
 
04:38:35.590 --> 04:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
Saturday school and I was just thinking
 
04:38:36.869 --> 04:38:36.879 align:start position:0%
to myself and I'd sit on these calls I'm
 
04:38:38.750 --> 04:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
like there's no no kid in New Hampshire
 
04:38:40.269 --> 04:38:40.279 align:start position:0%
who wants to who who would agree with
 
04:38:41.830 --> 04:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
the what these people are saying right
 
04:38:43.510 --> 04:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
what we really needed to do is to just
 
04:38:44.910 --> 04:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
allow these kids get back to a sense of
 
04:38:46.910 --> 04:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
normaly and I that what I used to
 
04:38:48.789 --> 04:38:48.799 align:start position:0%
describe it as I said I hope I want kids
 
04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
this summer to be able to all of them to
 
04:38:53.551 --> 04:38:53.561 align:start position:0%
go to Camp to go outside climb a tree
 
04:38:55.269 --> 04:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
skin their knee get grass between their
 
04:38:57.189 --> 04:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
toes right they needed to just be kids
 
04:39:00.189 --> 04:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
again we as a society had already um
 
04:39:02.230 --> 04:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
done a lot of stuff but part of that
 
04:39:03.990 --> 04:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
Partnership of providing scholarships to
 
04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
go to camps is we had a partnership with
 
04:39:06.990 --> 04:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
the community Behavior Health
 
04:39:09.869 --> 04:39:09.879 align:start position:0%
Association um and so we were training
 
04:39:11.949 --> 04:39:11.959 align:start position:0%
all of the camp counselors in camps to
 
04:39:14.470 --> 04:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
be able to uh recognize they weren't
 
04:39:16.230 --> 04:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
counselors but they would B basically
 
04:39:18.109 --> 04:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
say like a kid who's here hey I think
 
04:39:20.230 --> 04:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
this kid may have some struggles and so
 
04:39:22.349 --> 04:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
they would then refer them to the
 
04:39:24.510 --> 04:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
community Behavioral Health Association
 
04:39:26.949 --> 04:39:26.959 align:start position:0%
um they were providing Staffing on site
 
04:39:28.990 --> 04:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
most of the camp was like one day a week
 
04:39:30.750 --> 04:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
um and then if a kid needed additional
 
04:39:32.189 --> 04:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
Services they would work with the family
 
04:39:35.070 --> 04:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
to connect them up to full services so
 
04:39:38.190 --> 04:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
um so I I was sort of felt like and I I
 
04:39:39.270 --> 04:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
still like this program a lot I feel
 
04:39:40.470 --> 04:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
like you can have beths of Both Worlds
 
04:39:41.868 --> 04:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
right we can have kids running around
 
04:39:43.150 --> 04:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
but we can also kind of figure out the
 
04:39:44.510 --> 04:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
kids that might need extra supports and
 
04:39:46.670 --> 04:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
try and support them and you can read
 
04:39:48.510 --> 04:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
more about that um and then on September
 
04:39:51.350 --> 04:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
13th I wrote in oped um it says how
 
04:39:54.750 --> 04:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
about health as a CO exit strategy um
 
04:40:00.750 --> 04:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
just um focusing on the fact that uh um
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
and again you can read through it I'll
 
04:40:03.948 --> 04:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
read a paragraph This study provides
 
04:40:05.430 --> 04:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
compelling results that support the
 
04:40:07.150 --> 04:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
importance of a focus on lifestyle
 
04:40:09.670 --> 04:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
choices for healthy outcomes uh those
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
choices we know have a positive effect
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
on covid-19 resilience uh we also know
 
04:40:15.430 --> 04:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
that they have had a positive effect on
 
04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
resilience in many of the diseases as
 
04:40:19.350 --> 04:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
well as the severe covid-19 outcomes
 
04:40:21.430 --> 04:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
just trying to you know we had talked a
 
04:40:23.070 --> 04:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
lot about mitigation strategies all
 
04:40:24.270 --> 04:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
along but how about resilience
 
04:40:26.948 --> 04:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
strategies of healthiness is uh and a
 
04:40:29.430 --> 04:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
lot of the statistics here bear out that
 
04:40:30.990 --> 04:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
the individuals who had the worst
 
04:40:32.990 --> 04:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
outcomes from covid were individuals who
 
04:40:36.670 --> 04:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
had um you know preexisting conditions
 
04:40:39.150 --> 04:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
comorbidities and stuff like that um
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
October 7th um
 
04:40:45.670 --> 04:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
you know we this is a a press release um
 
04:40:47.708 --> 04:40:47.718 align:start position:0%
about covid response so we have learned
 
04:40:49.788 --> 04:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
throughout the past that most students
 
04:40:51.910 --> 04:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
are happy and learn best in during
 
04:40:53.550 --> 04:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
inperson instruction which provides them
 
04:40:54.628 --> 04:40:54.638 align:start position:0%
with the greatest opportunity for
 
04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
Success remote learning should be a last
 
04:40:59.190 --> 04:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
resort and should only be in place for a
 
04:41:00.990 --> 04:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
short amount of time if found to be
 
04:41:02.708 --> 04:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary for safety reasons
 
04:41:04.910 --> 04:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
and that was in response to a school
 
04:41:08.150 --> 04:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
that was um going to to I think Kelly's
 
04:41:11.628 --> 04:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
point was going to remote um I just I
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
have a couple of other this is a couple
 
04:41:15.230 --> 04:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
of social media things so the union
 
04:41:17.948 --> 04:41:17.958 align:start position:0%
leader reported uh a quote from me that
 
04:41:19.470 --> 04:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
says institutions of higher education
 
04:41:21.350 --> 04:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
should not be imposing vaccine mandates
 
04:41:22.750 --> 04:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
but instead should be focusing their
 
04:41:24.270 --> 04:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
efforts on supporting students and staff
 
04:41:26.430 --> 04:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
improving academic achievements and also
 
04:41:28.230 --> 04:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
allowing employees to decide what works
 
04:41:31.230 --> 04:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
best for their families um that made a
 
04:41:35.310 --> 04:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
few people unhappy um take four uh this
 
04:41:36.948 --> 04:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
pressured overreach requiring the
 
04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
implementation of a vaccine mandate for
 
04:41:40.190 --> 04:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
University employees was unnecessary and
 
04:41:41.708 --> 04:41:41.718 align:start position:0%
unproductive to our efforts to keep our
 
04:41:44.990 --> 04:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
community safe um resulting in some
 
04:41:45.000 --> 04:41:46.590 align:start position:0%
community safe um resulting in some
unhappy

04:41:46.590 --> 04:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
unhappy
 
04:41:49.550 --> 04:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
responses um and then this is somebody
 
04:41:53.110 --> 04:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
commenting on that on uh November 11th
 
04:41:54.670 --> 04:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
as if he hasn't already done enough
 
04:41:56.788 --> 04:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
damage to our Public School System NH
 
04:41:59.350 --> 04:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner has suggested I just like
 
04:42:00.750 --> 04:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
the hindsight aspect of this has
 
04:42:03.350 --> 04:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
suggested recruiting unvaxxed teachers
 
04:42:05.430 --> 04:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
um from New York who are protesting V
 
04:42:07.470 --> 04:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
mandates just what our state state needs
 
04:42:09.310 --> 04:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
right now um it's really time for
 
04:42:10.788 --> 04:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
parents to organize and so this was in
 
04:42:13.350 --> 04:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
response to um New York had imposed a
 
04:42:16.030 --> 04:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate on school teachers and
 
04:42:17.990 --> 04:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
many of them quit their jobs as a result
 
04:42:20.230 --> 04:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
of that and so I had made the suggestion
 
04:42:21.628 --> 04:42:21.638 align:start position:0%
that maybe we could find some good
 
04:42:22.750 --> 04:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
teachers because we were needing
 
04:42:24.430 --> 04:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
teachers and that maybe if we recruited
 
04:42:26.350 --> 04:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
some from that those individuals that
 
04:42:29.430 --> 04:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
might be good um might be a good idea to
 
04:42:31.750 --> 04:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
look at that um and then there was a
 
04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
press release on December 14th New
 
04:42:36.350 --> 04:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire assessment results um
 
04:42:37.830 --> 04:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
participation two things happened in
 
04:42:40.470 --> 04:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
assessment participation rates declined
 
04:42:43.030 --> 04:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
um Statewide 38% of students SED
 
04:42:46.030 --> 04:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
proficient uh or above math compared to
 
04:42:50.910 --> 04:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
48% uh in ela we were at 52% versus 56%
 
04:42:53.708 --> 04:42:53.718 align:start position:0%
and in science we're at 37% versus
 
04:42:57.230 --> 04:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
39% um and so just amplifying and
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the fact that we recognize
 
04:43:00.910 --> 04:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
we did have some learning gaps that were
 
04:43:03.350 --> 04:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
manifest in there um although I think
 
04:43:06.270 --> 04:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
that we even want the pre uh covid
 
04:43:10.270 --> 04:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
results to be a focus um and then uh
 
04:43:13.708 --> 04:43:13.718 align:start position:0%
just another social media post um from
 
04:43:16.708 --> 04:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
the Nea uh questioning you still oppose
 
04:43:19.070 --> 04:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
masks or vaccines and masks right now
 
04:43:21.830 --> 04:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
I've never said that um but I I oppose
 
04:43:24.590 --> 04:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates um but I but that's how
 
04:43:27.470 --> 04:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's interpreted so um providing
 
04:43:29.110 --> 04:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
educator then I did a press release on
 
04:43:30.590 --> 04:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
January 28th providing Educators with
 
04:43:33.310 --> 04:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
tools uh to build uh
 
04:43:35.990 --> 04:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
resilience um so back in that classroom
 
04:43:37.670 --> 04:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
just trying to equip our Educators so
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
that they can be as effective as they
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
can with a program like Reg regulated
 
04:43:44.190 --> 04:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
classroom um had a full-on campaign
 
04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
about leaning into literacy to make sure
 
04:43:48.190 --> 04:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
again literacy is the foundation for the
 
04:43:49.788 --> 04:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
instruction so any of our kids who had
 
04:43:51.150 --> 04:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
any kinds of gaps in that literacy to
 
04:43:53.910 --> 04:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're closing those gaps
 
04:43:56.590 --> 04:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
um and then there's one I'm going to
 
04:43:59.788 --> 04:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
back up to but uh so August 17th New
 
04:44:01.390 --> 04:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire expands access to free online
 
04:44:03.470 --> 04:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
tutoring we had our tutor.com in fact
 
04:44:04.788 --> 04:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
let me back up to another one I'm just
 
04:44:06.628 --> 04:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
going to lay out for
 
04:44:09.550 --> 04:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
you kind of a some of the Investments I
 
04:44:12.910 --> 04:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
think it's in this
 
04:44:16.270 --> 04:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
no I don't see it there um it's in here
 
04:44:17.948 --> 04:44:17.958 align:start position:0%
somewhere you'll be able to find
 
04:44:21.190 --> 04:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
it uh when our when our children Prosper
 
04:44:24.550 --> 04:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
we all Prosper was a September 26 2022
 
04:44:25.670 --> 04:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
coming out the other side of the
 
04:44:27.390 --> 04:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic we gain a bit of perspective on
 
04:44:28.990 --> 04:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
what took place and we can look back
 
04:44:30.270 --> 04:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
which is obviously what you're doing
 
04:44:33.230 --> 04:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
there is much we did um well and there's
 
04:44:35.270 --> 04:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
stuff that we can learn um but I want to
 
04:44:37.470 --> 04:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
just kind of outline kind of the some of
 
04:44:38.948 --> 04:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
the Investments that the department made
 
04:44:41.590 --> 04:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
throughout this process um so very early
 
04:44:44.110 --> 04:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
on we purchased a Statewide license for
 
04:44:46.190 --> 04:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
everybody to Canvas learning management
 
04:44:49.030 --> 04:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
system um part of this stems from the
 
04:44:52.590 --> 04:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
fact that what we saw was uh you know a
 
04:44:54.628 --> 04:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
a wide variety of instructional
 
04:44:56.590 --> 04:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities from you know some of our
 
04:44:58.550 --> 04:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
districts were right on it they had
 
04:45:00.430 --> 04:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
online learning resources their teachers
 
04:45:02.350 --> 04:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
jumped in and were going we had some
 
04:45:05.310 --> 04:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
districts that were uh you know sending
 
04:45:07.830 --> 04:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
out manila envelope packets and uh you
 
04:45:09.110 --> 04:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
know so not that good so we got a
 
04:45:10.990 --> 04:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
learning management system so that
 
04:45:12.470 --> 04:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
everybody could have access we then did
 
04:45:14.230 --> 04:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
a contract with Discovery Education
 
04:45:15.470 --> 04:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
which basically filled it with
 
04:45:17.670 --> 04:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
highquality instructional materials so
 
04:45:19.150 --> 04:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
every one of our kids could have access
 
04:45:21.070 --> 04:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
to a learning online learning management
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
system uh Discovery Education and this
 
04:45:26.230 --> 04:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
is you know this was back in the in May
 
04:45:30.310 --> 04:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
of 2020 or 2020 um we then uh did a
 
04:45:32.030 --> 04:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
contract with Gran State College to
 
04:45:33.948 --> 04:45:33.958 align:start position:0%
basically train all of our teachers over
 
04:45:36.270 --> 04:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
the summer on that uh how to use those
 
04:45:39.628 --> 04:45:39.638 align:start position:0%
tools and how to uh execute that well uh
 
04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
we did our leaning into literacy program
 
04:45:43.310 --> 04:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
we did we had three separate tutoring
 
04:45:44.868 --> 04:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
programs we did School house. world we
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
did yes every student we have tutor.com
 
04:45:49.750 --> 04:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh which is providing even today 247
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
tutoring uh we talked about a rekindling
 
04:45:53.910 --> 04:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
curiosity program the regulated
 
04:45:55.708 --> 04:45:55.718 align:start position:0%
classroom and one trusted adult to help
 
04:45:57.590 --> 04:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
our Educators when those kids are back
 
04:45:59.708 --> 04:45:59.718 align:start position:0%
in there to be able to uh you know
 
04:46:01.510 --> 04:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
engage those kids who maybe some of them
 
04:46:04.470 --> 04:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
forgot how School Works um we did a
 
04:46:05.550 --> 04:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
contract with we talked about the
 
04:46:07.110 --> 04:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
community Behavioral Health Association
 
04:46:08.670 --> 04:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
and then the last one is graduation
 
04:46:11.590 --> 04:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
Alliance uh which was a one-on-one um
 
04:46:14.350 --> 04:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
mentoring program for students uh so
 
04:46:16.030 --> 04:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
schools could just sign kids up and they
 
04:46:18.190 --> 04:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
would basically get I used refer to it
 
04:46:20.350 --> 04:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
and I hope this doesn't sound bad but
 
04:46:22.550 --> 04:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
they would get an extra grandparent uh
 
04:46:24.750 --> 04:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
who would you know call them text them
 
04:46:26.070 --> 04:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
in the morning hey did you go to school
 
04:46:27.910 --> 04:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
today did you do your homework uh so
 
04:46:29.030 --> 04:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's just basically a one-on-one
 
04:46:30.628 --> 04:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
mentoring program to make sure that kids
 
04:46:33.430 --> 04:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
had supports to so that they could be
 
04:46:36.868 --> 04:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
successful um you know in uh you know
 
04:46:36.878 --> 04:46:38.270 align:start position:0%
successful um you know in uh you know
just

04:46:38.270 --> 04:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:46:42.070 --> 04:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
um reflecting back um um you know
 
04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
there's obviously always things that you
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
might change you might do a little bit
 
04:46:46.788 --> 04:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
differently but in hindsight it's always
 
04:46:48.910 --> 04:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
tough to to deal with but I just thought
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh showing up and and walking you
 
04:46:52.270 --> 04:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
through kind of the pathway that we took
 
04:46:53.948 --> 04:46:53.958 align:start position:0%
might be helpful uh thank you
 
04:46:56.270 --> 04:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner for all that I do have a
 
04:46:58.830 --> 04:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
couple of questions okay um then I'll
 
04:47:04.430 --> 04:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
defer um my questions are about how
 
04:47:06.990 --> 04:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
one how did the guidance come to the
 
04:47:08.830 --> 04:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Education was it through
 
04:47:11.708 --> 04:47:11.718 align:start position:0%
Dr Chan was it through CD C was it
 
04:47:11.718 --> 04:47:12.628 align:start position:0%
Dr Chan was it through CD C was it
through

04:47:12.628 --> 04:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:47:16.190 --> 04:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS um and I want to talk about
 
04:47:18.390 --> 04:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
masking social
 
04:47:22.190 --> 04:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
distancing um and I do want to applaud
 
04:47:24.190 --> 04:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking a positive approach
 
04:47:26.590 --> 04:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
instead of a fear-mongering approach um
 
04:47:28.230 --> 04:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
when when dealing with the education
 
04:47:30.750 --> 04:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
because we know uh that fear can
 
04:47:33.150 --> 04:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
actually exasperate mental health uh so
 
04:47:36.190 --> 04:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
I do want to applaud you for that um so
 
04:47:38.390 --> 04:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
those are just a couple of the questions
 
04:47:41.868 --> 04:47:41.878 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know if you can again I mean
 
04:47:43.948 --> 04:47:43.958 align:start position:0%
Dr Chan should probably weigh in on this
 
04:47:46.670 --> 04:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
as well but um like so Dr Chan was
 
04:47:47.948 --> 04:47:47.958 align:start position:0%
responsible for public health and would
 
04:47:51.390 --> 04:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
set the public health policy um and then
 
04:47:52.990 --> 04:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
we were responsible for then
 
04:47:54.590 --> 04:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
communicating that and working with our
 
04:47:57.030 --> 04:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
schools to implement that policy um in
 
04:47:57.040 --> 04:47:58.510 align:start position:0%
schools to implement that policy um in
the

04:47:58.510 --> 04:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:00.590 --> 04:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
districts okay thank you does anyone
 
04:48:02.310 --> 04:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
else does anyone have any questions
 
04:48:05.030 --> 04:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
represent beler thank you madam chair
 
04:48:06.390 --> 04:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you commissioner for being
 
04:48:09.548 --> 04:48:09.558 align:start position:0%
here um so my question is it's a little
 
04:48:11.310 --> 04:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
bit little complicated let me set the
 
04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
stage so I think one of the things that
 
04:48:15.190 --> 04:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
I hear most about that people are not
 
04:48:17.110 --> 04:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
terribly happy with that happened during
 
04:48:20.390 --> 04:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
Co time is is how long schools had
 
04:48:22.628 --> 04:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
remained closed and the learning loss
 
04:48:24.510 --> 04:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
and other issues that occurred with
 
04:48:26.350 --> 04:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
students and I think part of our
 
04:48:27.910 --> 04:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility here in this committee is
 
04:48:30.310 --> 04:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
really trying to untangle this knot a
 
04:48:31.470 --> 04:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
little bit because this is really
 
04:48:32.948 --> 04:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
complicated it's not for the most part
 
04:48:34.310 --> 04:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's not as though you have a single
 
04:48:37.350 --> 04:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
person making all these decisions so
 
04:48:38.708 --> 04:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out where
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
different things were coming from and I
 
04:48:43.230 --> 04:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
can look right here at even all the way
 
04:48:46.868 --> 04:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
back in June or July of 2020 an NPR
 
04:48:49.830 --> 04:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
article you got the president in active
 
04:48:52.350 --> 04:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh conflict openly with the CDC guidance
 
04:48:55.070 --> 04:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's being put out on schools um it's
 
04:48:57.830 --> 04:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
a very complicated situation so my
 
04:49:01.548 --> 04:49:01.558 align:start position:0%
question with all of that is uh can you
 
04:49:03.310 --> 04:49:03.320 align:start position:0%
give us an idea
 
04:49:06.788 --> 04:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
of where some of this guidance may have
 
04:49:09.708 --> 04:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
been coming from for as far
 
04:49:12.390 --> 04:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
as because again it not all the
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
decisions were made by you or by the
 
04:49:15.868 --> 04:49:15.878 align:start position:0%
governor a lot of this was even handled
 
04:49:20.270 --> 04:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
locally so where were some of these um
 
04:49:22.590 --> 04:49:22.600 align:start position:0%
guidances coming down from and when it
 
04:49:25.270 --> 04:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
comes to especially the federal level
 
04:49:28.868 --> 04:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
and the CDC or any other relevant entity
 
04:49:32.030 --> 04:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
what carrots and sticks may have been
 
04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
brought to bear to see their guidance
 
04:49:36.510 --> 04:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
put into place at the state
 
04:49:39.230 --> 04:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
level yeah um so it's a complicated
 
04:49:40.830 --> 04:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
question so I'll try to do my best to
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
answer that question um so my uh
 
04:49:48.110 --> 04:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
understanding and my belief is that um
 
04:49:50.150 --> 04:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
you so Public Health was responsible for
 
04:49:51.350 --> 04:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
public health guidance and they were
 
04:49:55.350 --> 04:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
issuing the public health guidance um I
 
04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
believe that much of that guidance was
 
04:49:59.390 --> 04:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
taken from CDC and other words like we
 
04:50:02.270 --> 04:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
were pretty much following CDC guidance
 
04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if my memory is correct but
 
04:50:07.548 --> 04:50:07.558 align:start position:0%
I believe the maybe one of the first
 
04:50:11.070 --> 04:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
deviations from the CDC guidance took
 
04:50:13.910 --> 04:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
place in our reopening school guidance
 
04:50:16.350 --> 04:50:16.360 align:start position:0%
that we issued in July of 2020 um
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
because you'll recall at that time and
 
04:50:20.390 --> 04:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
again this stuff all seems kind of like
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh a little dystopian in hindsight right
 
04:50:24.350 --> 04:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
but they were saying like oh if you're
 
04:50:26.670 --> 04:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
six feet of social
 
04:50:30.470 --> 04:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
distancing um is what the CDC was
 
04:50:34.510 --> 04:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
recommending but I believe that Dr Chan
 
04:50:36.030 --> 04:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know if it was I I
 
04:50:37.230 --> 04:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
believe there was like an American
 
04:50:39.390 --> 04:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
Academy of Pediatrics article that said
 
04:50:41.390 --> 04:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
three feet is a good number right right
 
04:50:43.230 --> 04:50:43.240 align:start position:0%
and so I believe our school reopening
 
04:50:46.510 --> 04:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
guidance said 3 feet is a good number um
 
04:50:48.350 --> 04:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
and I so I would say like that was a I
 
04:50:51.030 --> 04:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
think maybe the first that I was that I
 
04:50:53.070 --> 04:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
knew about maybe we like deviated a
 
04:50:54.190 --> 04:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
little bit and we said like no we're
 
04:50:56.150 --> 04:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
going to tail of this to New Hampshire
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
and we put our own spin on there um but
 
04:51:00.868 --> 04:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
again that was guidance to the schools
 
04:51:04.430 --> 04:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
many of our schools at the school level
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
um had board votes and adopted we're
 
04:51:08.948 --> 04:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
going to follow the CDC guidance right
 
04:51:10.868 --> 04:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
and so you know apparent might call me
 
04:51:11.948 --> 04:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
up and says like well your school
 
04:51:14.948 --> 04:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
reopening guidance suggests 3 feet and
 
04:51:17.310 --> 04:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
but the school had adopted the CDC
 
04:51:19.750 --> 04:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
guidance so they're they basically had
 
04:51:22.430 --> 04:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
married themselves to that kind of a of
 
04:51:25.548 --> 04:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
a of a line and so does that kind of and
 
04:51:28.350 --> 04:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
so I think essentially you know like Dr
 
04:51:30.030 --> 04:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
Chan was the one who was setting that
 
04:51:31.548 --> 04:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
policy in terms of what we would do and
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
then we would work and then we would
 
04:51:34.230 --> 04:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
work in terms of carrots and sticks or
 
04:51:36.390 --> 04:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
we're not carrots and sticks um there
 
04:51:38.470 --> 04:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
were you know if I received concerns
 
04:51:39.708 --> 04:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
from parents I was reaching out to
 
04:51:41.070 --> 04:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
school leaders and saying like hey I'm
 
04:51:42.390 --> 04:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
hearing from your community they're
 
04:51:43.948 --> 04:51:43.958 align:start position:0%
concerned about this they're concerned
 
04:51:47.430 --> 04:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
that I you know um I mean there was a
 
04:51:49.510 --> 04:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
lot of different uh circumstances where
 
04:51:51.270 --> 04:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
that would might manifest itself I mean
 
04:51:53.150 --> 04:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
I had had you know a student I'm
 
04:51:54.910 --> 04:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
recalling an incident a student an
 
04:51:57.270 --> 04:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
autistic student who was incapable of
 
04:52:00.270 --> 04:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
wearing um you know he's in a CTE
 
04:52:02.190 --> 04:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
program and a welding program right and
 
04:52:03.270 --> 04:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
they were like well he has to wear a
 
04:52:05.310 --> 04:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
mask and I'm like well he can't wear a
 
04:52:08.150 --> 04:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
mask because of his uh you know the the
 
04:52:10.548 --> 04:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
type of autism that he he deals with and
 
04:52:12.070 --> 04:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
we had even before the pandemic had
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
already accommodated the non- masking we
 
04:52:15.310 --> 04:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
would have this kid welding without a
 
04:52:17.190 --> 04:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
full welding mask we let him use welding
 
04:52:18.590 --> 04:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
goggles because he could tolerate the
 
04:52:19.750 --> 04:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
welding goggles but he couldn't take the
 
04:52:22.628 --> 04:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
whole mask but when we relative to the
 
04:52:24.430 --> 04:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
covid we were suggesting that the mask
 
04:52:26.830 --> 04:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
was going to be required um even though
 
04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
we knew we would be able to isolate the
 
04:52:30.628 --> 04:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
child the student from other students
 
04:52:32.590 --> 04:52:32.600 align:start position:0%
you know at least the six feet distance
 
04:52:34.470 --> 04:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that so so I think you
 
04:52:35.948 --> 04:52:35.958 align:start position:0%
know there's just lots of fistic types
 
04:52:39.270 --> 04:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
of conversations and and um uh and
 
04:52:40.750 --> 04:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
information that you tried to you just
 
04:52:43.150 --> 04:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
tried to problem solve all day long
 
04:52:44.788 --> 04:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
represent Merchant did I answer all of
 
04:52:46.110 --> 04:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
your question it was a pretty complex
 
04:52:48.190 --> 04:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
question it was I just wanted to dig a
 
04:52:49.548 --> 04:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
tiny bit deeper because when I when I
 
04:52:50.990 --> 04:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
was talking carrots and sticks what I'm
 
04:52:52.868 --> 04:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
what I'm really interested mostly in is
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
is there was there anything coming down
 
04:52:57.868 --> 04:52:57.878 align:start position:0%
from the federal level suggesting that
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
if you follow or if you don't follow our
 
04:53:01.910 --> 04:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
CDC guidance we might come after your
 
04:53:04.150 --> 04:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
funding or or you get extra funding if
 
04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
you do this or that was was there
 
04:53:07.110 --> 04:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
anything like that going on I'm not
 
04:53:09.070 --> 04:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
aware of that happening at the education
 
04:53:10.990 --> 04:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
for the education funding there was
 
04:53:12.750 --> 04:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
there were plenty of strings but I don't
 
04:53:15.190 --> 04:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
recall those being some of them
 
04:53:17.030 --> 04:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
represent Merchant thank you I think
 
04:53:19.070 --> 04:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
actually representative Ed Abel had her
 
04:53:21.948 --> 04:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
hand up first Z Perler
 
04:53:24.430 --> 04:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
please thank you for being here I have
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
to say this is all giving me a little
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
bit of PTSD if you were recounting
 
04:53:30.350 --> 04:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
everything I can connect you with the
 
04:53:31.750 --> 04:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
community Behavioral Health Association
 
04:53:35.430 --> 04:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
I didn't even have a child in school
 
04:53:38.470 --> 04:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not a can I just respond to
 
04:53:40.190 --> 04:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
that for a moment again you know I mean
 
04:53:41.670 --> 04:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
this is the point like I mean we're this
 
04:53:45.030 --> 04:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
is not the first national emergency that
 
04:53:46.628 --> 04:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
that as a country we've been through and
 
04:53:51.110 --> 04:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
this is my point and um you know so I I
 
04:53:53.830 --> 04:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
hope that I don't know if it's the case
 
04:53:56.110 --> 04:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
but I hope that students would be able
 
04:54:00.750 --> 04:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
to look to adults and says like I was
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
empowered I was encouraged I was
 
04:54:06.670 --> 04:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
inspired by the response not one of of
 
04:54:09.390 --> 04:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
uh of instilling anxiety or fear in our
 
04:54:11.590 --> 04:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
students right so and I don't know what
 
04:54:13.590 --> 04:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
I didn't live through World War I or
 
04:54:15.190 --> 04:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
World War II so I don't know how that
 
04:54:16.628 --> 04:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
all played out and maybe there was a lot
 
04:54:19.230 --> 04:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
of anxiety Then but the same yeah you
 
04:54:21.230 --> 04:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
know but in the end it gives you
 
04:54:23.708 --> 04:54:23.718 align:start position:0%
strength and you rise above and all that
 
04:54:28.868 --> 04:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just trying to to remember um
 
04:54:31.990 --> 04:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
and as this relates to schools there was
 
04:54:34.910 --> 04:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
a lockdown period a required lockdown
 
04:54:37.830 --> 04:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
period that was a the emergency
 
04:54:39.708 --> 04:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
declaration by the governor was that
 
04:54:41.830 --> 04:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
about because I have a couple of
 
04:54:44.350 --> 04:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
questions was that about three months or
 
04:54:46.910 --> 04:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
six I can't the way that worked so the
 
04:54:48.830 --> 04:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
first one occurred in executive order
 
04:54:51.350 --> 04:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
number one it happened on March 15th um
 
04:54:54.150 --> 04:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
and it was for a two-e period um then
 
04:54:56.270 --> 04:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
that was continued for another twoe
 
04:55:00.430 --> 04:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
period and then on April 16th uh it was
 
04:55:02.110 --> 04:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
announced that that would continue
 
04:55:03.910 --> 04:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
through the end of the school year so
 
04:55:05.230 --> 04:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
it's not a fixed period it depending on
 
04:55:06.628 --> 04:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
when your school year ended but through
 
04:55:08.990 --> 04:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
the end of that school year um it did
 
04:55:10.910 --> 04:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
not extend into the summer programming
 
04:55:12.150 --> 04:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
which is why we were putting out
 
04:55:14.270 --> 04:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
guidance in June saying like hey your
 
04:55:15.628 --> 04:55:15.638 align:start position:0%
summer programming here's what this is
 
04:55:17.430 --> 04:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
going to look like and much of the
 
04:55:19.270 --> 04:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
summer programming is designed for
 
04:55:21.910 --> 04:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
special education students esy and so
 
04:55:23.670 --> 04:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
that's why we were so adamant about
 
04:55:25.788 --> 04:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
trying to get those kids you know with
 
04:55:28.670 --> 04:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities into the school over the
 
04:55:31.708 --> 04:55:31.718 align:start position:0%
summer thank you so just as a followup
 
04:55:34.190 --> 04:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
so what what I was trying to figure out
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
is after the required lockdown
 
04:55:41.628 --> 04:55:41.638 align:start position:0%
period whe whether a school wanted to
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
have lockdown whether they wanted to
 
04:55:46.430 --> 04:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
have masking whether they wanted to have
 
04:55:49.230 --> 04:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
a CO a covid vaccine mandate was that
 
04:55:53.948 --> 04:55:53.958 align:start position:0%
all a local locally based decision with
 
04:55:57.708 --> 04:55:57.718 align:start position:0%
guidance from public health correct well
 
04:55:58.788 --> 04:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
and guidance from the Department of
 
04:56:02.470 --> 04:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
Education as well so um and so I don't
 
04:56:04.708 --> 04:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
uh I prefer to use the term remote
 
04:56:06.270 --> 04:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
instruction as opposed to lockdown
 
04:56:07.868 --> 04:56:07.878 align:start position:0%
because quite frankly you didn't lock
 
04:56:09.070 --> 04:56:09.080 align:start position:0%
these kids I mean you could send them
 
04:56:10.350 --> 04:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
home you could try to lock them up
 
04:56:11.190 --> 04:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
they're not they're still doing
 
04:56:14.310 --> 04:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
something right so um and so essentially
 
04:56:15.868 --> 04:56:15.878 align:start position:0%
what happened is we provided guidance we
 
04:56:17.230 --> 04:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
had our start committee we provided
 
04:56:20.190 --> 04:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
guidance for how schools could safely
 
04:56:23.350 --> 04:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
reopen um and you know so and then
 
04:56:25.070 --> 04:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
school districts took that guidance and
 
04:56:26.948 --> 04:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
made a determination locally as to how
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
they were going to operate the
 
04:56:30.030 --> 04:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
department through the State Board of
 
04:56:32.510 --> 04:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
Education we did have a rule that you
 
04:56:33.788 --> 04:56:33.798 align:start position:0%
know that remember that rule that we put
 
04:56:36.270 --> 04:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
in place on March 12th of 2020 that
 
04:56:38.310 --> 04:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
enabled them to do that because prior to
 
04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
this they would not have been able to do
 
04:56:41.390 --> 04:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
that that right so we enabled them
 
04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
through that remote instruction rule to
 
04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
be a and then to be able to do that and
 
04:56:47.548 --> 04:56:47.558 align:start position:0%
then we provided them guidance for how
 
04:56:49.788 --> 04:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
they could uh if they were doing that or
 
04:56:51.230 --> 04:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
if they were doing inperson instruction
 
04:56:53.270 --> 04:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
how they could safely do that as
 
04:56:56.030 --> 04:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
well so so just as a followup as we're
 
04:56:58.190 --> 04:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
unwinding the knot and figuring out what
 
04:57:01.750 --> 04:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
the knots are yeah yeah I know
 
04:57:05.390 --> 04:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
really uh as far as the state response
 
04:57:08.470 --> 04:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
versus local school response there were
 
04:57:12.310 --> 04:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
many decisions that were made locally
 
04:57:16.590 --> 04:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
that were simply based on state guidance
 
04:57:18.310 --> 04:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
04:57:20.708 --> 04:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
requirements as far as the response to
 
04:57:22.670 --> 04:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
co I'm not sure I understand the
 
04:57:24.030 --> 04:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
question but I mean there were many
 
04:57:25.868 --> 04:57:25.878 align:start position:0%
decisions that were made locally they
 
04:57:27.470 --> 04:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
may have followed the school guidance or
 
04:57:29.430 --> 04:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
they may have decided to uh represent
 
04:57:30.750 --> 04:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
bel's question they may have decided to
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
follow the CDC guidance instead of that
 
04:57:34.788 --> 04:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
guidance right I mean that's what what
 
04:57:37.670 --> 04:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to say is that our charge is
 
04:57:39.590 --> 04:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
to look at the state response and I'm
 
04:57:41.708 --> 04:57:41.718 align:start position:0%
just trying to separate out what the
 
04:57:44.310 --> 04:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
state was requiring versus what
 
04:57:46.230 --> 04:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
decisions were being made at a local
 
04:57:49.470 --> 04:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
level with guidance that they chose
 
04:57:52.190 --> 04:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
whether it was yours or the cdc's or
 
04:57:54.470 --> 04:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
ours or the or um Public Health as well
 
04:57:56.310 --> 04:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
right right yeah right so all of the
 
04:57:57.948 --> 04:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
guidance documents that the department
 
04:58:00.788 --> 04:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
put out were vetted through the the
 
04:58:02.350 --> 04:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health right like
 
04:58:04.868 --> 04:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
so we weren't issuing guidance to
 
04:58:07.350 --> 04:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
schools that was not vetted and approved
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
by public
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
health represent Merchant and then
 
04:58:14.470 --> 04:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
represent cran thank you madam chair and
 
04:58:16.350 --> 04:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner for being
 
04:58:19.150 --> 04:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
here one of the things we heard earlier
 
04:58:24.750 --> 04:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
was the variance in how this pandemic
 
04:58:27.590 --> 04:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
impacted different parts of our society
 
04:58:31.510 --> 04:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.190 --> 04:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
factors in saying that given the fact
 
04:58:38.948 --> 04:58:38.958 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire we have
 
04:58:41.150 --> 04:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
communities with various
 
04:58:44.670 --> 04:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
resources and for remote learning to be
 
04:58:46.230 --> 04:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
effective one of the things that think
 
04:58:49.868 --> 04:58:49.878 align:start position:0%
is critical to it is technology
 
04:58:52.548 --> 04:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
resources so what kind of guidance did
 
04:58:55.788 --> 04:58:55.798 align:start position:0%
the department provide to those
 
04:58:57.628 --> 04:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
communities that didn't have the
 
04:59:00.190 --> 04:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
technology resources because if they
 
04:59:02.310 --> 04:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
don't have those
 
04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
resources what's the option for them
 
04:59:07.310 --> 04:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
yeah um so what we did is we worked very
 
04:59:10.430 --> 04:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
hard to close that resource Gap um
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
including um you know working in the
 
04:59:15.310 --> 04:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
supply chain to expedite uh like I can
 
04:59:17.910 --> 04:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
remember making phone calls I think to
 
04:59:20.110 --> 04:59:20.120 align:start position:0%
China trying to expedite stuff to get
 
04:59:22.070 --> 04:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know Chromebook orders delivered on
 
04:59:24.788 --> 04:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
time um you know who was a really good
 
04:59:26.910 --> 04:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
partner in this process was the uh the
 
04:59:29.470 --> 04:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
carriers throughout the process um right
 
04:59:32.190 --> 04:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
so if I had a student who was in remote
 
04:59:34.230 --> 04:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
instruction and was having difficulty
 
04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
with internet access um we would
 
04:59:39.708 --> 04:59:39.718 align:start position:0%
actually uh like I could I I have a
 
04:59:41.350 --> 04:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
specific instance right at a kid on a
 
04:59:43.270 --> 04:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
dead end Road like a dirt road end of
 
04:59:46.750 --> 04:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
the line and was and the the service was
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
not good um you know I I think it was
 
04:59:52.628 --> 04:59:52.638 align:start position:0%
Consolidated actually went out and
 
04:59:55.390 --> 04:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
replaced the switch to upgrade that
 
04:59:57.548 --> 04:59:57.558 align:start position:0%
household so that we would be able to
 
05:00:00.150 --> 05:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
get access to that household so um we
 
05:00:02.030 --> 05:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
just problem we we were doing problem
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
shooting throughout the process to be
 
05:00:08.110 --> 05:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
able to uh solve access um and resource
 
05:00:10.390 --> 05:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
problems for students um Chester I
 
05:00:11.670 --> 05:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
thought had a very creative thing they
 
05:00:13.390 --> 05:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
literally put like hotpots on some of
 
05:00:14.788 --> 05:00:14.798 align:start position:0%
their buses and drove their buses and
 
05:00:16.030 --> 05:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
parked them in apartment building
 
05:00:17.948 --> 05:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
parking lots uh so that the students
 
05:00:19.990 --> 05:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
would be able to gain access that way so
 
05:00:21.548 --> 05:00:21.558 align:start position:0%
it was really a function of just trying
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to solve those
 
05:00:28.070 --> 05:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
problems we had um you know uh churches
 
05:00:30.590 --> 05:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh that opened up and opened their doors
 
05:00:32.350 --> 05:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
and said hey students can come here and
 
05:00:34.310 --> 05:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
they can learn because we got Wi-Fi and
 
05:00:36.350 --> 05:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
so if you're don't have access you can
 
05:00:38.830 --> 05:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
come here um we had many schools who
 
05:00:40.910 --> 05:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
opened their buildings two students to
 
05:00:42.150 --> 05:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
be able to come in right so maybe they
 
05:00:43.390 --> 05:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
were doing remote but they would have
 
05:00:44.670 --> 05:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
they could allow kids to come in and
 
05:00:47.270 --> 05:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
gain access to uh you know the Wi-Fi
 
05:00:49.390 --> 05:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
there if that was an issue so um we
 
05:00:51.628 --> 05:00:51.638 align:start position:0%
tried to not have any of the Hales and
 
05:00:53.590 --> 05:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
the Have Nots but to try and make sure
 
05:00:56.230 --> 05:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
that all of the students had those
 
05:00:59.430 --> 05:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
resources um and were engaged with those
 
05:01:03.150 --> 05:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
resources followup thank you thank you
 
05:01:04.510 --> 05:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
for that as
 
05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
well do we have any um comparative data
 
05:01:12.190 --> 05:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
so try trying to look at data try to
 
05:01:15.390 --> 05:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
make this um sound as much as possible
 
05:01:18.070 --> 05:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
based upon the data do we have any
 
05:01:20.910 --> 05:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
comparison between communities that had
 
05:01:23.110 --> 05:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of the resources the ones
 
05:01:25.948 --> 05:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
that had to rely upon other entities
 
05:01:27.230 --> 05:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
including the Department of Health and
 
05:01:29.310 --> 05:01:29.320 align:start position:0%
the state and so forth to try to close
 
05:01:32.948 --> 05:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
that Gap so is there any kind of data we
 
05:01:34.350 --> 05:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
have available to us and looking at
 
05:01:35.750 --> 05:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
maybe test scores and so forth and
 
05:01:38.830 --> 05:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
saying because of the fact these
 
05:01:41.708 --> 05:01:41.718 align:start position:0%
communities struggled with trying to get
 
05:01:43.750 --> 05:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
the technology either be economically or
 
05:01:45.190 --> 05:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
the bandwidth wasn't available to them
 
05:01:46.310 --> 05:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
and so forth compared to those
 
05:01:47.910 --> 05:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
communities that probably were blessed
 
05:01:49.830 --> 05:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
with more resources and therefore didn't
 
05:01:52.230 --> 05:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
have to go through that closing of the
 
05:01:53.868 --> 05:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
Gap right so we have a lot of data in
 
05:01:56.110 --> 05:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
terms of student performance uh what we
 
05:01:58.190 --> 05:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
don't have is where those gaps were
 
05:02:00.430 --> 05:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
closed and how those gaps were closed um
 
05:02:03.230 --> 05:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
so it would be difficult to uh connect
 
05:02:05.390 --> 05:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
the two of those dots um quite frankly
 
05:02:08.270 --> 05:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
at this time right you know uh because
 
05:02:10.030 --> 05:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
and it it would have it would be a
 
05:02:13.628 --> 05:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
uneven thing uh in terms of you know
 
05:02:15.868 --> 05:02:15.878 align:start position:0%
this one I got theirs their Chromebooks
 
05:02:17.590 --> 05:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday these ones I was able to get
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
theirs on Thursday I don't know if you
 
05:02:20.350 --> 05:02:20.360 align:start position:0%
could actually make the case that that
 
05:02:21.430 --> 05:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
there's some kind of a correlation in
 
05:02:23.868 --> 05:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
terms of variability in terms of uh
 
05:02:25.628 --> 05:02:25.638 align:start position:0%
implementation really I think what
 
05:02:27.470 --> 05:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to find is it it would it
 
05:02:29.190 --> 05:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
drove all the way down kind of more at
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
the educator level in terms of how
 
05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
effective the educator was in during
 
05:02:37.390 --> 05:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
that spring period of time in terms of
 
05:02:38.788 --> 05:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
engaging and doing the remote
 
05:02:38.798 --> 05:02:40.750 align:start position:0%
engaging and doing the remote
instruction

05:02:40.750 --> 05:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
05:02:42.628 --> 05:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
and so and that that degree of
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness varied uh we provided a a
 
05:02:47.948 --> 05:02:47.958 align:start position:0%
ton of training resources uh you know
 
05:02:49.270 --> 05:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
working with gr State College in
 
05:02:52.190 --> 05:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
particular uh to help them if they if
 
05:02:54.708 --> 05:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
they needed that skill hone to make that
 
05:02:56.670 --> 05:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
resource available to
 
05:03:00.230 --> 05:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
them followup thank you one more
 
05:03:03.270 --> 05:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
question in regards to students and I
 
05:03:06.430 --> 05:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
think you spoke to it before about
 
05:03:08.350 --> 05:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
summer camp and getting out grass
 
05:03:09.510 --> 05:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
between your toes and skinning your
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
knees and all the good stuff and a lot
 
05:03:12.948 --> 05:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
of that's based upon why people go to
 
05:03:15.670 --> 05:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
summer camp is a social part of it and
 
05:03:17.390 --> 05:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
we're social animals we have a tendency
 
05:03:19.788 --> 05:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
to want to be with people and when
 
05:03:21.948 --> 05:03:21.958 align:start position:0%
you're sort of at home by yourself
 
05:03:23.470 --> 05:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
you're not really socializing with your
 
05:03:26.350 --> 05:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
peers is there any data out there in
 
05:03:29.310 --> 05:03:29.320 align:start position:0%
which we can show that because there was
 
05:03:31.430 --> 05:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
the issue of lack of
 
05:03:34.510 --> 05:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
socialization um that it had an impact I
 
05:03:36.390 --> 05:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
mean I'm trying to look at both sides of
 
05:03:38.510 --> 05:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
this equation and saying that yes
 
05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
there's a education component to it but
 
05:03:43.750 --> 05:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
getting somebody in a classroom is not
 
05:03:46.030 --> 05:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
just about the teacher it's also being
 
05:03:48.788 --> 05:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
with your peers socializing with all of
 
05:03:51.150 --> 05:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
the folks and so forth and I can go back
 
05:03:54.150 --> 05:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
when I was in school I look forward to
 
05:03:56.708 --> 05:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
catching up with my student body as much
 
05:03:58.910 --> 05:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
as probably more so than going to listen
 
05:04:01.350 --> 05:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
to my teacher yeah and and I think
 
05:04:02.670 --> 05:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
you'll see some information in this
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
packet about that I wrote I've written
 
05:04:07.510 --> 05:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
about that but I I and again this is why
 
05:04:09.830 --> 05:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
like before I'm trying to I was trying
 
05:04:15.948 --> 05:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:20.070 --> 05:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
Wellness yeah so on March 18th right so
 
05:04:22.070 --> 05:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
on March 16th we pivoted to remote on
 
05:04:24.390 --> 05:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
March 18th we put out healthy habits for
 
05:04:27.150 --> 05:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
well-being right like so that's not and
 
05:04:29.470 --> 05:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
and again part of the I mean we did that
 
05:04:30.750 --> 05:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
but one of the reason I want to flag it
 
05:04:33.270 --> 05:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
is because that wasn't a surprise right
 
05:04:34.830 --> 05:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
like would you articulate that there's a
 
05:04:36.708 --> 05:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
social component to this when you say
 
05:04:41.190 --> 05:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
those things um like that was well known
 
05:04:43.868 --> 05:04:43.878 align:start position:0%
um that this was a this this should be
 
05:04:45.670 --> 05:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
important to us to make sure that we're
 
05:04:48.470 --> 05:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
taking care of the uh that the wellness
 
05:04:49.788 --> 05:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly that and you'll see
 
05:04:52.230 --> 05:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
that resource was for students but for
 
05:04:54.708 --> 05:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
parents for and for my Educators as well
 
05:04:57.070 --> 05:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
right like I wanted everybody uh to be
 
05:04:59.948 --> 05:04:59.958 align:start position:0%
taken care of um and and to pay
 
05:05:01.788 --> 05:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
attention and they're they're were're
 
05:05:03.430 --> 05:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
and and they're flagged in this in this
 
05:05:06.070 --> 05:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
resourc there's you know sometimes
 
05:05:08.948 --> 05:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
obvious and very simple uh disciplines
 
05:05:10.548 --> 05:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
that you can use
 
05:05:12.390 --> 05:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
to keep that mental health strong and to
 
05:05:14.150 --> 05:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
be resilient right it doesn't it's not a
 
05:05:18.150 --> 05:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
complicated thing thank you represent
 
05:05:20.548 --> 05:05:20.558 align:start position:0%
craan um so my question actually
 
05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
connects back to the previous answer um
 
05:05:25.310 --> 05:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
so as somebody who did live through this
 
05:05:28.230 --> 05:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
period with three kids in school um I'm
 
05:05:30.708 --> 05:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
getting a different kind of ptsg um and
 
05:05:32.390 --> 05:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
I was wondering um so you mentioned all
 
05:05:35.430 --> 05:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
the different resources that that were
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
made available for teachers and learning
 
05:05:39.990 --> 05:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
how to um you know provide Prov their
 
05:05:42.110 --> 05:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
remote instruction um I definitely did
 
05:05:45.350 --> 05:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
see a huge variation um even within my
 
05:05:47.270 --> 05:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
my kids own teachers um so I would
 
05:05:48.750 --> 05:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
really love to hear a little bit more
 
05:05:51.310 --> 05:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
about that kind of um guidance that you
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
presented you know at the beginning when
 
05:05:56.910 --> 05:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
um schools were sort of all figuring out
 
05:05:58.670 --> 05:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
their own thing and we realized this was
 
05:06:00.910 --> 05:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
going to be an ongoing thing um a little
 
05:06:02.750 --> 05:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
bit more about that summer program
 
05:06:04.270 --> 05:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
because I don't remember that and then
 
05:06:07.590 --> 05:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
um also what you continued to provide um
 
05:06:10.510 --> 05:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
into this school year as I think as
 
05:06:12.470 --> 05:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
teachers began to
 
05:06:15.070 --> 05:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
actually apply that and see you know see
 
05:06:16.670 --> 05:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
how it was going in the real world
 
05:06:19.510 --> 05:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
situation and then uh with hybrid too
 
05:06:21.190 --> 05:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
once that switch over happened I would
 
05:06:22.390 --> 05:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
love to hear more about that thank you
 
05:06:24.110 --> 05:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
yeah great so happy to talk to you about
 
05:06:26.430 --> 05:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
that um and and I think you're
 
05:06:27.548 --> 05:06:27.558 align:start position:0%
emphasizing what I was trying to
 
05:06:29.628 --> 05:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
communicate here like if you wanted to
 
05:06:31.190 --> 05:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
try and find the correlation it was
 
05:06:33.310 --> 05:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
really educator by educator specific
 
05:06:35.590 --> 05:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
right um I'm not proud of this but I do
 
05:06:37.030 --> 05:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
know that I had Educators who seemed
 
05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
like they loaded assignments on Google
 
05:06:40.150 --> 05:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
Classroom on Monday
 
05:06:41.590 --> 05:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
and they checked them on Friday
 
05:06:43.110 --> 05:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes right and that was the extent
 
05:06:45.470 --> 05:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
of their remote instruction um and that
 
05:06:46.708 --> 05:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
was some of the feedback again this
 
05:06:48.350 --> 05:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
would be like a worst case scenario but
 
05:06:50.430 --> 05:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
I I can tell you I took incoming calls
 
05:06:52.350 --> 05:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
from families describing that as a
 
05:06:55.190 --> 05:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
circumstance all the way to Educators
 
05:06:57.230 --> 05:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
you know Educators who turn their living
 
05:07:00.110 --> 05:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
rooms into entertainment platforms for
 
05:07:02.110 --> 05:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
them to engage the kids and find ways to
 
05:07:04.430 --> 05:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
do it so it really was I think to your
 
05:07:07.830 --> 05:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
point it was very educator um dependent
 
05:07:09.470 --> 05:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of that experience in terms
 
05:07:12.270 --> 05:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
terms of the remote instruction um so
 
05:07:13.830 --> 05:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
again the resources that we brought to
 
05:07:15.990 --> 05:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
them were a learning management system
 
05:07:18.150 --> 05:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
right a canvas Learning Management
 
05:07:21.030 --> 05:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
platform um a we filled that with
 
05:07:22.510 --> 05:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
Discovery Education and I don't know if
 
05:07:24.270 --> 05:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
your children or your school district
 
05:07:26.390 --> 05:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
use Discovery or not I can't tell you
 
05:07:29.150 --> 05:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
today a 100% of the schools in the state
 
05:07:31.788 --> 05:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire are using
 
05:07:33.750 --> 05:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
Discovery you know whether they all got
 
05:07:35.430 --> 05:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
on board on day one or not I don't you
 
05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
know like I I think it took some ramp up
 
05:07:40.750 --> 05:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
time um you know then in addition to
 
05:07:43.510 --> 05:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
that we basically um you know provided
 
05:07:45.470 --> 05:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
them full training like okay how do you
 
05:07:47.270 --> 05:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
use canvas how would you use Discovery
 
05:07:49.510 --> 05:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
if you're doing or we we had a you know
 
05:07:51.150 --> 05:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
Granite State College set up an entire
 
05:07:52.868 --> 05:07:52.878 align:start position:0%
training program they actually to able
 
05:07:54.708 --> 05:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
to receive it had 12 different modules
 
05:07:56.190 --> 05:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
that accumulated over time and they
 
05:07:57.948 --> 05:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
could earn college I think I don't
 
05:07:58.990 --> 05:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
remember exactly how many college
 
05:07:59.990 --> 05:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
credits but they could earn college
 
05:08:01.350 --> 05:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
credits towards a master's degree by
 
05:08:03.030 --> 05:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
participating in these programs if they
 
05:08:04.910 --> 05:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to learn those uh those kinds of
 
05:08:07.628 --> 05:08:07.638 align:start position:0%
things so um and then throughout this
 
05:08:09.830 --> 05:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
program time as well like we set an
 
05:08:13.628 --> 05:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
entire um new website uh separate from
 
05:08:15.030 --> 05:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
the department's website just about
 
05:08:16.830 --> 05:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
covid response and it dealt there were
 
05:08:18.548 --> 05:08:18.558 align:start position:0%
different sections of the website but
 
05:08:20.910 --> 05:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
one of those sections had was simply
 
05:08:24.430 --> 05:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
around uh pedagogy and how to do an
 
05:08:27.948 --> 05:08:27.958 align:start position:0%
effective instruction um and and we had
 
05:08:30.270 --> 05:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
you know Educators sharing on that
 
05:08:32.310 --> 05:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
platform how they're doing it and what's
 
05:08:35.350 --> 05:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
working and what's not working um so I
 
05:08:37.190 --> 05:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
mean I I don't think I could do justice
 
05:08:40.590 --> 05:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
to the amount of of touches and
 
05:08:43.070 --> 05:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
resources um probably at least three
 
05:08:44.310 --> 05:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
time well I know at least three times a
 
05:08:46.750 --> 05:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
week through the spring uh we were doing
 
05:08:48.868 --> 05:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
Statewide calls uh you know and
 
05:08:51.390 --> 05:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
trainings um we were then in addition to
 
05:08:53.270 --> 05:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
those three times a week state by calls
 
05:08:55.830 --> 05:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
then that would spin off additional uh
 
05:08:57.230 --> 05:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
lessons like okay what are you
 
05:08:59.110 --> 05:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
struggling with and we would get on and
 
05:09:00.990 --> 05:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
we would do Zoom meetings with them and
 
05:09:02.548 --> 05:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
trying to explain to them how to resolve
 
05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
certain problems or not um you know so
 
05:09:09.590 --> 05:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
just trying to give them the tools um
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
and then the skills because again it was
 
05:09:13.670 --> 05:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
a new paradigm for many of our Educators
 
05:09:15.390 --> 05:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh to be able to be successful because
 
05:09:16.990 --> 05:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
that was the goal to just make them as
 
05:09:20.310 --> 05:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
possible yes um do you have any data on
 
05:09:25.548 --> 05:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
just kind of like the uptake of of all
 
05:09:29.708 --> 05:09:29.718 align:start position:0%
the different programs and um yeah any
 
05:09:31.788 --> 05:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
correlations with efficacy or or
 
05:09:33.830 --> 05:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
anything like that I'm just looking for
 
05:09:35.590 --> 05:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
data yes so we could go back I mean so
 
05:09:37.070 --> 05:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
we could tell you how many people
 
05:09:38.590 --> 05:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
started using Discovery how many people
 
05:09:39.910 --> 05:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
are on canvas
 
05:09:41.628 --> 05:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
and uh we could figure out I can you
 
05:09:43.510 --> 05:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
know I can provide data to you and just
 
05:09:44.948 --> 05:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
show you here's the engagements that we
 
05:09:46.470 --> 05:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
have on these various platforms happy to
 
05:09:46.480 --> 05:09:48.150 align:start position:0%
have on these various platforms happy to
do

05:09:48.150 --> 05:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:09:50.350 --> 05:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
05:09:52.868 --> 05:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
POA thank you for being here can I just
 
05:09:54.510 --> 05:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
and I just want to but I want to caution
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not somebody use
 
05:09:58.030 --> 05:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
Discovery or not is not going to be
 
05:09:59.350 --> 05:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
indicative of the learning because if a
 
05:10:00.910 --> 05:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
district already had their own resources
 
05:10:02.270 --> 05:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
and they're doing a good job and that
 
05:10:05.150 --> 05:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
teacher got everything they needing um
 
05:10:06.590 --> 05:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
then they wouldn't have engaged it so it
 
05:10:08.990 --> 05:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be as important um so just keep
 
05:10:11.628 --> 05:10:11.638 align:start position:0%
that in in mind like if you had a low
 
05:10:13.670 --> 05:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
uptake that's not necessarily indicative
 
05:10:16.350 --> 05:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
of lack of efficacy um and again because
 
05:10:18.910 --> 05:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
today I know that 100% of my schools are
 
05:10:22.030 --> 05:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
using uh you know um Discovery there's
 
05:10:24.070 --> 05:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
been like over 1.2 million engagements
 
05:10:26.350 --> 05:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
on the Discovery platform um across the
 
05:10:30.430 --> 05:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
state so um you know so if they didn't
 
05:10:32.390 --> 05:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
grab it then they maybe subsequently
 
05:10:35.230 --> 05:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
realized that it was um a valuable
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
resource but the the strategy was not
 
05:10:39.350 --> 05:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
because we didn't have the ability to
 
05:10:41.390 --> 05:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
drive them into a resource and force
 
05:10:43.070 --> 05:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
them like we need to say like okay
 
05:10:44.788 --> 05:10:44.798 align:start position:0%
everybody has if I had my way I would
 
05:10:45.750 --> 05:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
have put my hand down and say
 
05:10:47.628 --> 05:10:47.638 align:start position:0%
everybody's got to use canvas you know
 
05:10:48.948 --> 05:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
everybody's got to use these curriculum
 
05:10:50.390 --> 05:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
resources every one of your teachers has
 
05:10:51.948 --> 05:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
to go through the udl training everybody
 
05:10:53.390 --> 05:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
has to go through this but that's not
 
05:10:54.670 --> 05:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
what it is what we did is we tried to
 
05:10:56.670 --> 05:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
close gaps by making stuff available and
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
then Educators could engage or not
 
05:11:01.150 --> 05:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
engage as they see fit okay thanks
 
05:11:02.390 --> 05:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's helpful because yeah I'm hearing
 
05:11:03.788 --> 05:11:03.798 align:start position:0%
all this I'm like I don't know that I
 
05:11:06.430 --> 05:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
saw all of these that was all out there
 
05:11:08.350 --> 05:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
you know like so but again and and we
 
05:11:10.708 --> 05:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
communicated 100 ways a Sunday uh to be
 
05:11:12.390 --> 05:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
able to make sure that everybody had
 
05:11:14.310 --> 05:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
access to these things so we both
 
05:11:16.430 --> 05:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
granted access and we tried to drive it
 
05:11:18.350 --> 05:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
actually sorry can I ask one and and
 
05:11:19.430 --> 05:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
just to be clear like all those were
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
available to families too right but the
 
05:11:23.948 --> 05:11:23.958 align:start position:0%
difficulty is as you know by law like I
 
05:11:26.230 --> 05:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
don't have families I can't contact
 
05:11:28.590 --> 05:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
families right like I can I can pass
 
05:11:29.910 --> 05:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
information to school leaders and then
 
05:11:31.270 --> 05:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
School leaders are the ones who are
 
05:11:32.868 --> 05:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
driving that message on to their
 
05:11:35.030 --> 05:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
families so if I'm dropping it off at
 
05:11:36.628 --> 05:11:36.638 align:start position:0%
the school and the school says like no
 
05:11:38.470 --> 05:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
we don't need that and then maybe they
 
05:11:40.430 --> 05:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
didn't share it with you then their
 
05:11:42.110 --> 05:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
school leader believed that their
 
05:11:43.910 --> 05:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
solution was going to be more efficac
 
05:11:45.150 --> 05:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
than the resources we were providing
 
05:11:47.590 --> 05:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
them I'm going to defer to represent po
 
05:11:49.350 --> 05:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
off and if there's time because I know
 
05:11:49.360 --> 05:11:51.190 align:start position:0%
off and if there's time because I know
the

05:11:51.190 --> 05:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:11:53.788 --> 05:11:53.798 align:start position:0%
Comm yes so
 
05:11:58.430 --> 05:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
please so the sign shows that kids are
 
05:12:02.628 --> 05:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
less affected by covid than uh uh Elders
 
05:12:02.638 --> 05:12:04.230 align:start position:0%
less affected by covid than uh uh Elders
uh

05:12:04.230 --> 05:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:12:07.510 --> 05:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
so what's understanding in Department
 
05:12:10.390 --> 05:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
regarding to that low risk and how it
 
05:12:13.830 --> 05:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
was communicated uh to the department
 
05:12:18.910 --> 05:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
over time that maybe this group is not
 
05:12:20.910 --> 05:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
the one that needs to be protected
 
05:12:24.070 --> 05:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
because there's almost no risk for kids
 
05:12:27.150 --> 05:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
for example no otherwise healthy kids
 
05:12:31.430 --> 05:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
died from Co in New Hampshire yeah um so
 
05:12:33.788 --> 05:12:33.798 align:start position:0%
again I I think I pointed to uh you know
 
05:12:35.750 --> 05:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
Health as a covid-19 exit strategy is
 
05:12:37.788 --> 05:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
one of the op-eds that I wrote um and I
 
05:12:39.830 --> 05:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
do recognize that both
 
05:12:42.750 --> 05:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know age but generally the age is
 
05:12:45.230 --> 05:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
associated with the um the fact that
 
05:12:46.990 --> 05:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
they tend not to have comorbidities
 
05:12:50.948 --> 05:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
comorbidities um and so uh you know just
 
05:12:52.110 --> 05:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
05:12:55.230 --> 05:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
encourage um you know families that it's
 
05:12:57.110 --> 05:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
going to be okay right so we were
 
05:12:59.510 --> 05:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
working with again so C Health
 
05:13:00.430 --> 05:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
Department Department of Health and
 
05:13:02.750 --> 05:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
Human Services is communicating you know
 
05:13:04.230 --> 05:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
that information we're trying to
 
05:13:06.470 --> 05:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
communicate to families that we have a
 
05:13:08.750 --> 05:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
plan to safely conduct school right you
 
05:13:10.590 --> 05:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
can do do it we got this so that's what
 
05:13:13.030 --> 05:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
our message all along has been we can do
 
05:13:15.310 --> 05:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
this we can do it safely and it's okay
 
05:13:16.868 --> 05:13:16.878 align:start position:0%
um but I will tell you that I had many
 
05:13:19.470 --> 05:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
parents you know even up till the end
 
05:13:21.548 --> 05:13:21.558 align:start position:0%
right calling me and and concerned or
 
05:13:24.030 --> 05:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
like afraid I'm I'm not I don't I will
 
05:13:25.788 --> 05:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
not send my child to that building
 
05:13:27.430 --> 05:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
because I don't want them to get Co
 
05:13:30.070 --> 05:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
right so the society had instilled a
 
05:13:34.110 --> 05:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
fear in many families about an um you
 
05:13:36.270 --> 05:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
know a danger that didn't exist to their
 
05:13:40.030 --> 05:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
children um and so uh
 
05:13:41.948 --> 05:13:41.958 align:start position:0%
you know they and and many adults
 
05:13:43.990 --> 05:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
believed a lot of those fears as well
 
05:13:46.670 --> 05:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
and so if those were repeated then that
 
05:13:49.628 --> 05:13:49.638 align:start position:0%
just Amplified the the incorrect
 
05:13:52.788 --> 05:13:52.798 align:start position:0%
information and you mentioned that uh
 
05:13:55.708 --> 05:13:55.718 align:start position:0%
teachers unions were criticizing New
 
05:13:58.788 --> 05:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire approach in the Press but are
 
05:14:01.350 --> 05:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
you aware that unions also had the
 
05:14:04.788 --> 05:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
direct input on cdc's recommendations
 
05:14:08.470 --> 05:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
regarding lockdowns and and other uh I I
 
05:14:10.470 --> 05:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
do vagu recommend that there was a story
 
05:14:11.948 --> 05:14:11.958 align:start position:0%
about that but that's you know what at
 
05:14:12.990 --> 05:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
this point in time I would throw that
 
05:14:15.230 --> 05:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
into the ancient history kind of a of a
 
05:14:17.110 --> 05:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
thing but yes I do understand that that
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
may have been happening but again you
 
05:14:21.270 --> 05:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
know we were you know Public Health was
 
05:14:23.230 --> 05:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
taking that CDC guidance and translating
 
05:14:25.070 --> 05:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
into a New Hampshire specific guidance
 
05:14:28.510 --> 05:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
so uh rep uh commissioner I understand
 
05:14:30.430 --> 05:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
that you have a hard stop I have a lot
 
05:14:31.788 --> 05:14:31.798 align:start position:0%
of folks here that still have some
 
05:14:34.110 --> 05:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
questions would you mind if people
 
05:14:35.910 --> 05:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
funnel questions through me and then I
 
05:14:37.750 --> 05:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
sent them to you and maybe you could get
 
05:14:41.230 --> 05:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
back to us that way back back come back
 
05:14:43.548 --> 05:14:43.558 align:start position:0%
oh that would be wonderful so thank you
 
05:15:01.150 --> 05:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:03.590 --> 05:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
here this this will probably work on
 
05:15:07.948 --> 05:15:07.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:07.958 --> 05:15:11.190 align:start position:0%

questions about trust and stuff like
 
05:16:34.590 --> 05:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
that but
 
05:16:38.230 --> 05:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
um these uh I'd like to go over these
 
05:16:38.240 --> 05:16:39.430 align:start position:0%
um these uh I'd like to go over these
sheets

05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
sheets
 
05:16:44.708 --> 05:16:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:47.110 --> 05:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
to you hit your mic button so please
 
05:16:49.670 --> 05:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
turn back on what I hope to prove to you
 
05:16:54.390 --> 05:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
is that the um danger of covid was
 
05:16:54.400 --> 05:16:55.548 align:start position:0%
is that the um danger of covid was
severely

05:16:55.548 --> 05:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
severely
 
05:16:58.670 --> 05:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
overstated and the danger of the
 
05:17:02.548 --> 05:17:02.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine has not been recognized yet and
 
05:17:05.310 --> 05:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
but it's very it's very dangerous okay
 
05:17:05.320 --> 05:17:06.628 align:start position:0%
but it's very it's very dangerous okay
so

05:17:06.628 --> 05:17:06.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:17:09.440 --> 05:17:09.450 align:start position:0%
um let's go back
 
05:17:09.450 --> 05:17:12.470 align:start position:0%
um let's go back
[Music]

05:17:12.470 --> 05:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:17:16.990 --> 05:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
to okay if we look at the Matrix in the
 
05:17:17.000 --> 05:17:17.948 align:start position:0%
to okay if we look at the Matrix in the
upper

05:17:17.948 --> 05:17:17.958 align:start position:0%
upper
 
05:17:22.590 --> 05:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
left that is all the de this this comes
 
05:17:24.470 --> 05:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
from New
 
05:17:27.470 --> 05:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's um Health and Human Services
 
05:17:29.788 --> 05:17:29.798 align:start position:0%
all this sta it's not them theirs
 
05:17:32.470 --> 05:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
directly it's me summarizing what they
 
05:17:35.310 --> 05:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
have collected so they're Co dashboard
 
05:17:38.150 --> 05:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
correct Co they have a CO dashboard on
 
05:17:38.160 --> 05:17:40.190 align:start position:0%
correct Co they have a CO dashboard on
DH

05:17:40.190 --> 05:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
DH
 
05:17:42.390 --> 05:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
yes I actually move along the graphs to
 
05:17:44.868 --> 05:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
see when everything is at every time
 
05:17:46.708 --> 05:17:46.718 align:start position:0%
okay so this in the upper left we have
 
05:17:49.430 --> 05:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
the the first three years of covid I I
 
05:17:50.670 --> 05:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
haven't collected the fourth year
 
05:17:55.788 --> 05:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
because after May um the um the state of
 
05:17:58.230 --> 05:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
emergency was over and it became much
 
05:18:00.990 --> 05:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
more difficult to to collect data but
 
05:18:03.590 --> 05:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
anyway so uh the the interesting thing
 
05:18:05.350 --> 05:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
about that is if you look at the
 
05:18:08.310 --> 05:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
percentages at the bottom you can see
 
05:18:12.708 --> 05:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
that um ltcf is long-term care fa
 
05:18:15.868 --> 05:18:15.878 align:start position:0%
facility and you can see the percentage
 
05:18:18.190 --> 05:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
of the deaths that were in long-term
 
05:18:21.310 --> 05:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
care facilities okay with 71% was the
 
05:18:24.510 --> 05:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
first year but then then it it dropped
 
05:18:26.390 --> 05:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
down uh
 
05:18:29.430 --> 05:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
substantially okay so that's the uh and
 
05:18:32.110 --> 05:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
and you get the totals over there now
 
05:18:35.270 --> 05:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
the one in the middle shows the three
 
05:18:38.110 --> 05:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
years the deaths by age for the three
 
05:18:40.990 --> 05:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
years it
 
05:18:43.868 --> 05:18:43.878 align:start position:0%
the in the first year which I call the
 
05:18:47.510 --> 05:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
fear year um only
 
05:18:49.430 --> 05:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
the in the
 
05:18:52.830 --> 05:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
last the the vaccine started December
 
05:18:56.070 --> 05:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
14th in New Hampshire so only at the
 
05:18:58.788 --> 05:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
tail end of the first year could some
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
people get vaccines and the only people
 
05:19:04.510 --> 05:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
who were allowed to to get them were the
 
05:19:07.708 --> 05:19:07.718 align:start position:0%
Aged and the infirm the the at risk
 
05:19:10.590 --> 05:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
population okay the
 
05:19:14.030 --> 05:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
um the the second year
 
05:19:19.150 --> 05:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
um the vaccines were rolled out in March
 
05:19:22.350 --> 05:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
which began the second year of covid and
 
05:19:24.830 --> 05:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's when The Wider population was
 
05:19:30.030 --> 05:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to get it okay now I have
 
05:19:34.430 --> 05:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
um I have several reasons to believe
 
05:19:37.910 --> 05:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
that covid was the danger of covid was
 
05:19:37.920 --> 05:19:39.990 align:start position:0%
that covid was the danger of covid was
overstated

05:19:39.990 --> 05:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
overstated
 
05:19:42.270 --> 05:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
the first the first one the earliest one
 
05:19:46.470 --> 05:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
was CDC said at the end of uh 2020 that
 
05:19:46.480 --> 05:19:48.150 align:start position:0%
was CDC said at the end of uh 2020 that
only

05:19:48.150 --> 05:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:19:52.470 --> 05:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
6% of death certificates were covid
 
05:19:57.910 --> 05:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
alone and out of the rest they had um an
 
05:20:00.830 --> 05:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
average of 2.6
 
05:20:04.548 --> 05:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
comorbidities so um that's an inference
 
05:20:08.670 --> 05:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
that the people if covid is a rest
 
05:20:10.590 --> 05:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
respiratory disease and like many
 
05:20:13.030 --> 05:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
respiratory diseases there's an un
 
05:20:15.230 --> 05:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
underlying condition that that tips them
 
05:20:17.910 --> 05:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
over okay so that's the first thing the
 
05:20:20.868 --> 05:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
second one is
 
05:20:20.878 --> 05:20:24.470 align:start position:0%
second one is
um

05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:27.750 --> 05:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the keing Sentinel reported on
 
05:20:27.760 --> 05:20:29.030 align:start position:0%
in the keing Sentinel reported on
December

05:20:29.030 --> 05:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
December
 
05:20:34.310 --> 05:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
30th 2020 we had a um vaccine clinic
 
05:20:36.830 --> 05:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
over at Keen Center which is in town
 
05:20:38.868 --> 05:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
it's one it's a long-term care care
 
05:20:39.990 --> 05:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
facility in
 
05:20:42.230 --> 05:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
town and
 
05:20:47.310 --> 05:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
um first of all in in TW in 2020 eight
 
05:20:51.070 --> 05:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
people died in chesher County with covid
 
05:20:55.070 --> 05:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh Ju Just eight
 
05:20:58.430 --> 05:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
um so go go to
 
05:21:02.350 --> 05:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
January and at Keen Center they had a
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
vaccine clinic on December 30th and the
 
05:21:09.670 --> 05:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
keing sent reported that 12 people died
 
05:21:12.830 --> 05:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
12 out of the 85 residents died in
 
05:21:15.788 --> 05:21:15.798 align:start position:0%
January one month following their
 
05:21:17.788 --> 05:21:17.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine clinic the month following their
 
05:21:21.310 --> 05:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine clinic now
 
05:21:26.830 --> 05:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire said 10 of those 12
 
05:21:28.470 --> 05:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
died with
 
05:21:31.868 --> 05:21:31.878 align:start position:0%
covid okay and in total in total for
 
05:21:36.628 --> 05:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
while eight died in 2020 in 10 months
 
05:21:40.110 --> 05:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
was remember eight died out of 75,000
 
05:21:46.670 --> 05:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
people in in uh cheser County and 10
 
05:21:51.030 --> 05:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
died with covid at one facility with 85
 
05:21:53.750 --> 05:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
people in one month following their
 
05:21:56.750 --> 05:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine clinic so that that's a strong
 
05:22:00.150 --> 05:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
inference okay here's here's um in total
 
05:22:02.230 --> 05:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
for the year
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
2021 while less less than one died per
 
05:22:09.270 --> 05:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
month in 2020 more than five died per
 
05:22:11.310 --> 05:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
month in chesher
 
05:22:15.510 --> 05:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
County um in 2021 with the with the
 
05:22:17.548 --> 05:22:17.558 align:start position:0%
alleged benefit of the
 
05:22:20.628 --> 05:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
vaccine okay um one more thing about
 
05:22:20.638 --> 05:22:22.590 align:start position:0%
vaccine okay um one more thing about
this

05:22:22.590 --> 05:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:22:27.270 --> 05:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:30.110 --> 05:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
um the the less the less serious that
 
05:22:35.190 --> 05:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
this is um Beth da Dr Beth daily um
 
05:22:41.070 --> 05:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
at Governor sununu's April 29th
 
05:22:44.110 --> 05:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
21 press conference was answering
 
05:22:46.670 --> 05:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
questions at the end and one of the one
 
05:22:50.430 --> 05:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
of the questions was um who's who's
 
05:22:53.830 --> 05:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
dying from from this and this is what Dr
 
05:22:53.840 --> 05:22:55.670 align:start position:0%
dying from from this and this is what Dr
Daly

05:22:55.670 --> 05:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
Daly
 
05:22:59.190 --> 05:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
said Dr Del said I think the question
 
05:23:00.990 --> 05:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
you want to know is about who the people
 
05:23:05.070 --> 05:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
are in terms of age and medical
 
05:23:07.270 --> 05:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
comorbidity all of the deaths now there
 
05:23:09.788 --> 05:23:09.798 align:start position:0%
were 1300 more than 1300 dead at this
 
05:23:12.390 --> 05:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
time with covid she
 
05:23:16.590 --> 05:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
said all of the deaths except for one or
 
05:23:21.070 --> 05:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
maybe two are either age 65 and older or
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
have underlying medical conditions so
 
05:23:27.430 --> 05:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
there were only one or two people that
 
05:23:30.628 --> 05:23:30.638 align:start position:0%
didn't have some other kind of
 
05:23:35.708 --> 05:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:40.150 --> 05:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
um the the death definition of being
 
05:23:42.868 --> 05:23:42.878 align:start position:0%
hospitalized with covid or dying with
 
05:23:46.750 --> 05:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
covid was was very was loose in the
 
05:23:49.670 --> 05:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
first year but then in January of the
 
05:23:54.030 --> 05:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
second year both um both both Dr fouchi
 
05:23:55.708 --> 05:23:55.718 align:start position:0%
and the World Health
 
05:24:00.310 --> 05:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
Organization put out um a meta a memos
 
05:24:03.990 --> 05:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
which foui said that there were too too
 
05:24:06.390 --> 05:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
many positives we knew there were a lot
 
05:24:08.948 --> 05:24:08.958 align:start position:0%
of false positives
 
05:24:11.350 --> 05:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
we we knew we knew the public knew that
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
but and and um the World Health
 
05:24:16.590 --> 05:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
Organization said why which was what you
 
05:24:18.190 --> 05:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
know it's the number of Cycles you use
 
05:24:21.030 --> 05:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
in the PCR test
 
05:24:26.230 --> 05:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
so the fouchi said that there's too many
 
05:24:28.868 --> 05:24:28.878 align:start position:0%
and the World Health Organization said
 
05:24:31.270 --> 05:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
basically this test can be manipulated
 
05:24:35.830 --> 05:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
which it was so the 2020 deaths were
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
over were less were less blamed on covid
 
05:24:45.510 --> 05:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
were less um of were less true than the
 
05:24:47.750 --> 05:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
than the deaths that came after this
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
makes the vaccine look more favorable
 
05:24:53.590 --> 05:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
and covid look more
 
05:24:57.270 --> 05:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
dangerous now okay now let's go let's go
 
05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
to the numbers in in the middle graph in
 
05:25:03.910 --> 05:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
the middle um table okay you can see
 
05:25:07.310 --> 05:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
that at every age group every working
 
05:25:10.110 --> 05:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
age group there's at least three times
 
05:25:14.990 --> 05:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
as many dying with covid in the second
 
05:25:17.190 --> 05:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
year in the Jabs year when these the
 
05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
these are these are only people that are
 
05:25:22.190 --> 05:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
not in long-term care facilities so
 
05:25:23.830 --> 05:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
they're not in a nursing home and
 
05:25:24.910 --> 05:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
they're not in
 
05:25:27.990 --> 05:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
jail so this is this is our relatively a
 
05:25:31.390 --> 05:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
relatively healthy population and in the
 
05:25:33.510 --> 05:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
year that they can get the
 
05:25:37.910 --> 05:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
Jabs um in every in at every age group
 
05:25:39.788 --> 05:25:39.798 align:start position:0%
through more than three times for for
 
05:25:43.030 --> 05:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
working people more than three times um
 
05:25:44.430 --> 05:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
the number of people are dead now the
 
05:25:46.750 --> 05:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
these are not huge numbers in New
 
05:25:51.948 --> 05:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but project this out to um to
 
05:25:53.910 --> 05:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
both the country and the world and you
 
05:25:57.190 --> 05:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
you you you have a a huge problem okay
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
and some people could say some people
 
05:26:00.910 --> 05:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
could say well maybe this is just
 
05:26:02.590 --> 05:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
because the disease
 
05:26:06.830 --> 05:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
spread but then you have um look to the
 
05:26:11.030 --> 05:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
bottom line the bottom line is the
 
05:26:14.350 --> 05:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
percentage who the percentage of deaths
 
05:26:17.350 --> 05:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
that is less than age 70 so for the
 
05:26:19.470 --> 05:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
first year for the 12 months
 
05:26:23.270 --> 05:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
ending um in the first year only
 
05:26:27.548 --> 05:26:27.558 align:start position:0%
12% were under were under age 70 but you
 
05:26:30.910 --> 05:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
can see as as the vaccines kick in how
 
05:26:34.110 --> 05:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
this how this um percentage goes up
 
05:26:37.310 --> 05:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
until the for the second year the 12
 
05:26:40.830 --> 05:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
months of the second year it's 37%
 
05:26:43.990 --> 05:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's an extraordinary difference 12%
 
05:26:47.670 --> 05:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
under ag7 or 37% under AG 70 well you
 
05:26:50.030 --> 05:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
take a look like the the biggest CH the
 
05:26:53.430 --> 05:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
biggest people hurt relatively is like
 
05:26:56.110 --> 05:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
these these the 40y olds where seven
 
05:27:00.070 --> 05:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
died in the first year and 49 in in the
 
05:27:04.350 --> 05:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
second year now it should be remembered
 
05:27:06.070 --> 05:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
that a
 
05:27:08.628 --> 05:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
45-year-old has an expectation of Life
 
05:27:12.548 --> 05:27:12.558 align:start position:0%
of 36 more years whereas an 85y old when
 
05:27:15.030 --> 05:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
someone dies more than
 
05:27:18.548 --> 05:27:18.558 align:start position:0%
80 um 85 year olds have have a future
 
05:27:22.070 --> 05:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
expectation of about six years so it's
 
05:27:25.830 --> 05:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's a much greater loss of life when
 
05:27:27.750 --> 05:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
the young people are affected and that's
 
05:27:30.390 --> 05:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
what actually has happened with with
 
05:27:32.868 --> 05:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
these with these shots and then you see
 
05:27:35.030 --> 05:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
you see it it hangs up there for a
 
05:27:37.430 --> 05:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
little bit and then you know people stop
 
05:27:38.670 --> 05:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
taking the shot
 
05:27:41.030 --> 05:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
people knew you know and and now you see
 
05:27:44.830 --> 05:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
it trailing down again okay and and and
 
05:27:46.350 --> 05:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
and it's continued low I looked a little
 
05:27:47.910 --> 05:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
bit in the fourth year it's continuing
 
05:27:49.310 --> 05:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
down from that
 
05:27:52.830 --> 05:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
20% okay so so
 
05:27:57.708 --> 05:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
um that's this also notice on here um
 
05:28:01.310 --> 05:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
the Z the 0er to9 group and the 10 to9
 
05:28:03.910 --> 05:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
group now several of the people have
 
05:28:06.868 --> 05:28:06.878 align:start position:0%
said that this is not a danger to young
 
05:28:09.590 --> 05:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
people you can see we have and that's
 
05:28:13.070 --> 05:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
there's only one death in in the uh even
 
05:28:17.430 --> 05:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
till today from covid that is under age
 
05:28:19.948 --> 05:28:19.958 align:start position:0%
20 so you got to you got to wonder a
 
05:28:25.110 --> 05:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
little bit why um colleges insisted that
 
05:28:26.628 --> 05:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
there are people it has to do with
 
05:28:29.190 --> 05:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
spread also so it's it's it's not
 
05:28:31.948 --> 05:28:31.958 align:start position:0%
clearcut it's like spread versus danger
 
05:28:34.948 --> 05:28:34.958 align:start position:0%
and and you know what everybody has said
 
05:28:38.190 --> 05:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
is right that it's not a danger to kids
 
05:28:42.670 --> 05:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
but uh my wife is in uh is visiting her
 
05:28:47.110 --> 05:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
grandson in Canada right now and she uh
 
05:28:48.910 --> 05:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
she always comes back with a cold so
 
05:28:52.830 --> 05:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
this idea of killing grandma is not
 
05:28:55.708 --> 05:28:55.718 align:start position:0%
completely is not completely wrong in
 
05:28:57.510 --> 05:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
other words the spread the the kids
 
05:28:59.548 --> 05:28:59.558 align:start position:0%
they're on school buses they're whatever
 
05:29:01.868 --> 05:29:01.878 align:start position:0%
you know there is something to that and
 
05:29:04.070 --> 05:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
so you have to be
 
05:29:06.708 --> 05:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
careful at the time when when this stuff
 
05:29:10.830 --> 05:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
is around that um between the
 
05:29:15.030 --> 05:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
association of uh of people like me who
 
05:29:18.470 --> 05:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
are 72 and my grandchildren you know
 
05:29:21.510 --> 05:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
this okay
 
05:29:23.470 --> 05:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
um all
 
05:29:27.230 --> 05:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
right so I I hope I hope I hope that
 
05:29:31.070 --> 05:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
that shows that now um I've given you a
 
05:29:33.110 --> 05:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
paper here and this just came out in the
 
05:29:36.830 --> 05:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
last two weeks it's by this scientist uh
 
05:29:39.708 --> 05:29:39.718 align:start position:0%
Toby um
 
05:29:43.990 --> 05:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
Toby Roberts I think is and he um he's a
 
05:29:46.470 --> 05:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
Toby Rogers and he's
 
05:29:49.750 --> 05:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh he's he's about the best most clear
 
05:29:52.390 --> 05:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
this is this is an easy read these these
 
05:29:55.590 --> 05:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
10 pages this is probably the most ma
 
05:29:58.150 --> 05:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
one of the most amazing things you have
 
05:30:00.788 --> 05:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
ever read in in your life if you if you
 
05:30:02.670 --> 05:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
read this and it
 
05:30:06.310 --> 05:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
discusses what um we need to remake our
 
05:30:10.190 --> 05:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
medical system okay it this discusses
 
05:30:10.200 --> 05:30:14.430 align:start position:0%
medical system okay it this discusses
what

05:30:14.430 --> 05:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:18.110 --> 05:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
um that this this is um you know I
 
05:30:20.430 --> 05:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
wonder um I don't I don't know if it's
 
05:30:25.470 --> 05:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
fair to ask you but um is it fair to ask
 
05:30:26.510 --> 05:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
I don't want to do something that's
 
05:30:32.350 --> 05:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:34.270 --> 05:30:34.280 align:start position:0%
V only
 
05:30:34.280 --> 05:30:36.430 align:start position:0%
V only
one

05:30:36.430 --> 05:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:30:41.070 --> 05:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
really two okay I would I would
 
05:30:44.310 --> 05:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
advise all I've seen vax and vax 2 vax
 
05:30:46.350 --> 05:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
is better because it gets it's a
 
05:30:48.470 --> 05:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
government movie also it's about
 
05:30:51.190 --> 05:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
government it's it's much of what's in
 
05:30:54.708 --> 05:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
that movie is like the game plan for CO
 
05:30:58.350 --> 05:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
as far as CDC is concerned so it's it's
 
05:31:01.948 --> 05:31:01.958 align:start position:0%
an extremely good movie for people who
 
05:31:05.310 --> 05:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
who are in government to see and I I
 
05:31:08.788 --> 05:31:08.798 align:start position:0%
would recommend that uh Mr um
 
05:31:10.990 --> 05:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
mof is that correct I pronounce your
 
05:31:13.230 --> 05:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
name correctly thank you um I just have
 
05:31:16.030 --> 05:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
a quick question for you um you
 
05:31:18.750 --> 05:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that the who in the
 
05:31:22.350 --> 05:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
PCR test um and I believe the CDC and
 
05:31:24.390 --> 05:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
they said the data could be
 
05:31:27.350 --> 05:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
manipulated um is that information on
 
05:31:30.070 --> 05:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
where you got that in this packet here
 
05:31:33.948 --> 05:31:33.958 align:start position:0%
or do you have no um I I we've
 
05:31:39.150 --> 05:31:39.160 align:start position:0%
been I'm I'm in a group and um we knew
 
05:31:41.510 --> 05:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
and I checked with I we're in a group
 
05:31:43.910 --> 05:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
and my one of the members of our group
 
05:31:45.548 --> 05:31:45.558 align:start position:0%
wrote a letter I write a lot of letter
 
05:31:49.110 --> 05:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
just to the editor I wrote I uh The
 
05:31:52.190 --> 05:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
keing Sentinel accepts almost all of
 
05:31:55.270 --> 05:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
them what they don't accept one of one
 
05:31:57.030 --> 05:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
of the most important things I've ever
 
05:32:00.548 --> 05:32:00.558 align:start position:0%
written was this is the reason these are
 
05:32:03.270 --> 05:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
the reasons I will not take the vaccine
 
05:32:06.830 --> 05:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
okay and I wrote that on April 3rd
 
05:32:09.948 --> 05:32:09.958 align:start position:0%
2021 I sent it to a lot of print papers
 
05:32:11.708 --> 05:32:11.718 align:start position:0%
nobody would print it I mean there was
 
05:32:14.390 --> 05:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
all sorts of stuff coming out you know
 
05:32:16.310 --> 05:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
pounding us to take the vaccine and
 
05:32:18.150 --> 05:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
stuff stuff like this and there was no
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
one there was no one standing up and the
 
05:32:23.548 --> 05:32:23.558 align:start position:0%
King Sentinel wouldn't print it now I'm
 
05:32:27.230 --> 05:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
not I'm not I'm an independent I
 
05:32:30.230 --> 05:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
supported Bernie in 2016 I supported
 
05:32:33.110 --> 05:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
tulsy and yang in
 
05:32:36.628 --> 05:32:36.638 align:start position:0%
2020 um I'm a Democrat right now but I
 
05:32:38.948 --> 05:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
ran as a Republican for the legislature
 
05:32:41.948 --> 05:32:41.958 align:start position:0%
last year I've rush for school board
 
05:32:43.910 --> 05:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
I've run in four elections I've lost all
 
05:32:47.070 --> 05:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
four of them in 10 years right I I won
 
05:32:50.470 --> 05:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
one in thank you for trying what you
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
said thank you for putting your hat in
 
05:32:54.430 --> 05:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
the ring right I was I won one in uh
 
05:32:56.110 --> 05:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
Port Washington I got on the school
 
05:32:59.190 --> 05:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
board through a fluke through a fluke
 
05:33:02.990 --> 05:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
but that's uh anyway um there are a
 
05:33:07.788 --> 05:33:07.798 align:start position:0%
number of industries that let us down uh
 
05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative Penza has a question okay
 
05:33:13.548 --> 05:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
and so does representative pull us
 
05:33:16.590 --> 05:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
off so if you don't have those specific
 
05:33:19.590 --> 05:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
areas about uh with PCR and running up
 
05:33:22.708 --> 05:33:22.718 align:start position:0%
the Cycles I did ask uh in in what was
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
that our first committee meeting or
 
05:33:26.510 --> 05:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
second committee meeting um that
 
05:33:28.230 --> 05:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
information specifically from the
 
05:33:29.590 --> 05:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
Department here in the state of New
 
05:33:31.868 --> 05:33:31.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what we were at but I do have
 
05:33:33.350 --> 05:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
that information to provide to the
 
05:33:34.868 --> 05:33:34.878 align:start position:0%
committee because I think it's very
 
05:33:38.230 --> 05:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
important um because at a at a period of
 
05:33:41.948 --> 05:33:41.958 align:start position:0%
time when testing was very um you know
 
05:33:44.070 --> 05:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
we didn't the testing now was totally
 
05:33:46.470 --> 05:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
different when it first came out and so
 
05:33:48.670 --> 05:33:48.680 align:start position:0%
and I knew that a like you're talking
 
05:33:50.910 --> 05:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
about but I have specific scientific
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
information that talks about that
 
05:33:54.948 --> 05:33:54.958 align:start position:0%
creator of the test and all of that so
 
05:33:56.150 --> 05:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to provide that to
 
05:33:57.150 --> 05:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
committee because that's what you were
 
05:33:58.868 --> 05:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
referring to when you were discussing
 
05:34:00.788 --> 05:34:00.798 align:start position:0%
that right in regards with like false
 
05:34:02.270 --> 05:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
positives and those numbers were
 
05:34:05.390 --> 05:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
inflated yes they were
 
05:34:08.470 --> 05:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
um more than half the positive for false
 
05:34:11.830 --> 05:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
positives and it's also the case that
 
05:34:14.628 --> 05:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis was I mean it could have
 
05:34:17.150 --> 05:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
been that you had a positive P PCR test
 
05:34:19.830 --> 05:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
28 days ago and then you go to the
 
05:34:21.830 --> 05:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
hospital with something you've got the
 
05:34:25.270 --> 05:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
heart disease you know and uh then you
 
05:34:29.110 --> 05:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
die right you're hospitalized with covid
 
05:34:30.670 --> 05:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
and you might not even have it you you
 
05:34:32.270 --> 05:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
might not have had it because the PCR
 
05:34:34.548 --> 05:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
test was false and you might not have it
 
05:34:37.230 --> 05:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
because you got over it but you had it
 
05:34:39.590 --> 05:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
the early EST it was that was that was
 
05:34:42.350 --> 05:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
the worst case when did you have one
 
05:34:46.590 --> 05:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
within the last month or but but the
 
05:34:49.110 --> 05:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
um people people were using very high
 
05:34:51.510 --> 05:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
numbers I say more than 50% because I
 
05:34:55.470 --> 05:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
feel that safe I feel in 2020 okay now
 
05:34:58.470 --> 05:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
in 2021 the the diagnoses were more
 
05:35:01.470 --> 05:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
strict right and and and they looked it
 
05:35:03.390 --> 05:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
was like antigen tests now and and they
 
05:35:05.670 --> 05:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
were looking for other ways to confirm
 
05:35:08.430 --> 05:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
it but that was when that was when the
 
05:35:11.110 --> 05:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine was in gear okay right uh
 
05:35:13.030 --> 05:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative poov has a question for
 
05:35:15.230 --> 05:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
you sir thank you for being here and
 
05:35:18.310 --> 05:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving us this important
 
05:35:22.830 --> 05:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh data on New Hampshire des and uh I
 
05:35:25.150 --> 05:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
mostly clear on the numbers the only one
 
05:35:28.868 --> 05:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
uh you were mentioning about 12 people
 
05:35:31.470 --> 05:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
dying 10 of them with Co and it was
 
05:35:35.628 --> 05:35:35.638 align:start position:0%
after December 30th clinic but uh what
 
05:35:39.708 --> 05:35:39.718 align:start position:0%
was population out of which uh 12 people
 
05:35:41.510 --> 05:35:41.520 align:start position:0%

Sentinel
 
05:36:00.750 --> 05:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
um there was a
 
05:36:05.990 --> 05:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
similar in U in um Peterboro there was
 
05:36:08.230 --> 05:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh the Manan uh
 
05:36:11.350 --> 05:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
reported a similar thing that that month
 
05:36:14.070 --> 05:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
11 people died around the country if you
 
05:36:17.470 --> 05:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
look if you look at the graphs of covid
 
05:36:19.990 --> 05:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
deaths in the United States which are e
 
05:36:21.430 --> 05:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
easy to find you go to the big
 
05:36:24.270 --> 05:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet you click United States
 
05:36:26.750 --> 05:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
you'll find that
 
05:36:31.110 --> 05:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
that that um the week coincidentally
 
05:36:35.510 --> 05:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
around January 6th that week was the
 
05:36:38.430 --> 05:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
highest uh number of you'll see that's
 
05:36:45.628 --> 05:36:45.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:49.030 --> 05:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
um you know after that it started going
 
05:36:50.590 --> 05:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
down but that was the roll out the roll
 
05:36:53.708 --> 05:36:53.718 align:start position:0%
out in the whole country was in this you
 
05:36:57.350 --> 05:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
know in dece in late December and then
 
05:37:00.110 --> 05:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
all these people died now it part of
 
05:37:02.830 --> 05:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
that is going to be seasonal because
 
05:37:04.470 --> 05:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's the season when people die from
 
05:37:06.430 --> 05:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
respiratory disease it happens every
 
05:37:08.390 --> 05:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
year it's usually flu
 
05:37:10.030 --> 05:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
05:37:13.670 --> 05:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
um but this but this that's that's the
 
05:37:16.030 --> 05:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
ones that were labeled Co that's the
 
05:37:19.948 --> 05:37:19.958 align:start position:0%
week that uh that it was the highest
 
05:37:24.070 --> 05:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh just some clarification on these
 
05:37:26.590 --> 05:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh numbers is this all of New Hampshire
 
05:37:29.628 --> 05:37:29.638 align:start position:0%
or just ches County or just Kean no no
 
05:37:31.070 --> 05:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:37:33.830 --> 05:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
the the example from Keen Center is
 
05:37:36.350 --> 05:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
cheser County and Peterboro is not in
 
05:37:39.948 --> 05:37:39.958 align:start position:0%
chesher County but th this sheet is all
 
05:37:42.510 --> 05:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
this sheet is all of New Hampshire okay

asking Mr ad a question I would have
 
05:38:13.270 --> 05:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
asked him what is the state policy with
 
05:38:16.110 --> 05:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
05:38:20.190 --> 05:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
um going to school and vaccines I mean

05:38:25.230 --> 05:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
I I didn't live here I would hate to be
 
05:38:27.750 --> 05:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
a parent right now knowing what I know I
 
05:38:29.548 --> 05:38:29.558 align:start position:0%
would hate to be a parent and having
 
05:38:32.470 --> 05:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
having to make that decision but then
 
05:38:36.190 --> 05:38:36.200 align:start position:0%

offer an answer to that um we do not as
 
05:38:43.990 --> 05:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
of now nor has New Hampshire ever uh
 
05:38:46.030 --> 05:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
added the covid vaccine to the childhood
 
05:38:48.030 --> 05:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
schedule to require it for any of our
 
05:38:49.750 --> 05:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
Public Schools so it's not something
 
05:38:51.310 --> 05:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
that has to happen what about the other
 
05:38:53.468 --> 05:38:53.478 align:start position:0%

thank you very much um I was just sort
 
05:45:24.510 --> 05:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
of I I wanted to just take a couple of
 
05:45:26.750 --> 05:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
minutes maybe we could uh I just wanted
 
05:45:29.510 --> 05:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
to ask the chair what she had in mind
 
05:45:32.430 --> 05:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
for um I know we have the homeland
 
05:45:35.628 --> 05:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
security director coming in on the 29th
 
05:45:39.948 --> 05:45:39.958 align:start position:0%
and I wondered who was at 9:00 a.m. umgg
 
05:45:42.948 --> 05:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
so far I haven't uh that is as far as
 
05:45:45.310 --> 05:45:45.320 align:start position:0%
I've got although I listening today I
 
05:45:47.390 --> 05:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
think Dr Chan would be somebody that we
 
05:45:50.590 --> 05:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
would want to have here and talk with um
 
05:45:52.948 --> 05:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
because I think that would be important
 
05:45:55.468 --> 05:45:55.478 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else um I know that
 
05:45:57.270 --> 05:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
we'll probably have more questions for
 
05:45:58.948 --> 05:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
the commission commissioner edel BL at
 
05:46:02.430 --> 05:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
sometime and I'm sure we'll have uh more
 
05:46:04.868 --> 05:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
questions for commissioner Tilly at some
 
05:46:07.830 --> 05:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
point but I think having uh uh the
 
05:46:10.468 --> 05:46:10.478 align:start position:0%
director from Homeland Security here uh
 
05:46:14.868 --> 05:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
will probably open up a a new amount of
 
05:46:19.628 --> 05:46:19.638 align:start position:0%
um curiosity and uh questions for us uh
 
05:46:22.708 --> 05:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
which is the 29th um and at this time I
 
05:46:24.708 --> 05:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
don't have anyone else speaking that day
 
05:46:26.990 --> 05:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
I am going to look to I have people
 
05:46:29.670 --> 05:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
contact me that do want to come in so I
 
05:46:32.390 --> 05:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
will be checking availability but as you
 
05:46:37.110 --> 05:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
know um we are subject to like if we
 
05:46:39.468 --> 05:46:39.478 align:start position:0%
want Dr Chan here we are subject to his
 
05:46:43.590 --> 05:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
schedule um so I've been trying to to
 
05:46:47.468 --> 05:46:47.478 align:start position:0%
work uh to limit us like to every other
 
05:46:50.430 --> 05:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
week but if we have to do back I'm
 
05:46:52.868 --> 05:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
beholden to their schedules so
 
05:46:55.788 --> 05:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I can't tell you exactly
 
05:46:58.548 --> 05:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
when we'll be meeting after the 29th are
 
05:47:01.430 --> 05:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
you shooting for Fridays FKS I am still
 
05:47:03.310 --> 05:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
hoping for Fridays I think Friday seems
 
05:47:05.670 --> 05:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
to work best for most
 
05:47:07.590 --> 05:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
people um
 
05:47:09.708 --> 05:47:09.718 align:start position:0%
is there anyone you have in mind uh that
 
05:47:11.948 --> 05:47:11.958 align:start position:0%
you'd like to see in representative
 
05:47:16.830 --> 05:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
evil um I I had mentioned Dr Chan um one
 
05:47:19.110 --> 05:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
person I mean I I don't know how
 
05:47:21.390 --> 05:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
relevant it is I could check in with him
 
05:47:25.868 --> 05:47:25.878 align:start position:0%
is the is the head of doit he's the IT
 
05:47:28.190 --> 05:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
director and I don't know how much he
 
05:47:30.708 --> 05:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
had involved with the with the remote
 
05:47:33.468 --> 05:47:33.478 align:start position:0%
and and just getting things going I
 
05:47:36.430 --> 05:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
could ask him that's just one idea but I
 
05:47:37.990 --> 05:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
think you're right when the homeland
 
05:47:42.070 --> 05:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
security um fellow director comes maybe
 
05:47:44.310 --> 05:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
he'll give us some ideas we can spawn
 
05:47:47.628 --> 05:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
off of him but I um and you know I I
 
05:47:49.310 --> 05:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe we want someone from
 
05:47:51.190 --> 05:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
the governor's office at some point to
 
05:47:53.750 --> 05:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
come and speak but I I think you've hit
 
05:47:56.510 --> 05:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
the the high points um the only other
 
05:47:59.270 --> 05:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is that the 29th is
 
05:48:02.708 --> 05:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
Easter weekend so maybe not the
 
05:48:05.628 --> 05:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon if we could avoid it okay I
 
05:48:07.590 --> 05:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
will take that under advice advisement
 
05:48:10.510 --> 05:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent likeus you had
 
05:48:13.708 --> 05:48:13.718 align:start position:0%
something oh yeah I was just trying to
 
05:48:15.990 --> 05:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
make sure we deal with that stack of
 
05:48:17.548 --> 05:48:17.558 align:start position:0%
paper and then whoever that's supposed
 
05:48:20.708 --> 05:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
to go okay so so that that was uh
 
05:48:24.350 --> 05:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
something that was given last week but
 
05:48:27.910 --> 05:48:27.920 align:start position:0%

05:48:29.910 --> 05:48:29.920 align:start position:0%

05:48:32.350 --> 05:48:32.360 align:start position:0%

realize that when I scheduled it and it
 
05:48:46.708 --> 05:48:46.718 align:start position:0%
was the only day that the director said
 
05:48:48.708 --> 05:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
