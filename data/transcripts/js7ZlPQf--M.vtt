00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
sort of popped up and then disappeared
 

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.630 align:start position:0%

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%

is<01:13:38.320><c> basic</c><01:13:39.679><c> science</c><01:13:40.679><c> what</c><01:13:40.880><c> that</c><01:13:41.080><c> means</c><01:13:41.520><c> is</c><01:13:41.960><c> that</c>

01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
is basic science what that means is that

is when they get small enough that they

bypass those natural mechanisms and they

01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
reach the Deep lung and that's why
 

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.070 align:start position:0%
reach the Deep lung and that's why
you'll<01:14:19.320><c> see</c><01:14:20.000><c> I've</c><01:14:20.159><c> cited</c><01:14:20.520><c> some</c><01:14:20.719><c> but</c><01:14:20.880><c> there's</c>

01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
will say the small guys are the problem
 

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.830 align:start position:0%
will say the small guys are the problem
because<01:14:26.679><c> they're</c><01:14:26.880><c> associated</c><01:14:27.320><c> with</c><01:14:27.520><c> disease</c>

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
because they're associated with disease
 

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.070 align:start position:0%
because they're associated with disease
and<01:14:28.040><c> they</c><01:14:28.199><c> bypass</c><01:14:28.719><c> Natural</c><01:14:29.199><c> Body</c><01:14:29.520><c> mechanisms</c>

and<01:14:30.199><c> they</c><01:14:30.320><c> reach</c><01:14:30.560><c> deep</c><01:14:30.800><c> into</c><01:14:31.000><c> the</c>

01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%

01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
outdoors spread out you know yeah would
 

01:21:19.199 --> 01:21:20.750 align:start position:0%
outdoors spread out you know yeah would
you<01:21:19.400><c> rather</c><01:21:19.600><c> not</c><01:21:19.840><c> have</c><01:21:20.199><c> a</c><01:21:20.280><c> bunch</c><01:21:20.440><c> of</c><01:21:20.560><c> people</c>

01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
you rather not have a bunch of people
 

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.390 align:start position:0%
you rather not have a bunch of people
right<01:21:21.120><c> together</c><01:21:21.520><c> I</c><01:21:21.639><c> guess</c><01:21:21.880><c> but</c><01:21:22.040><c> I'd</c><01:21:22.199><c> rather</c>

01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
right together I guess but I'd rather
 

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:25.629 align:start position:0%

01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:25.639 align:start position:0%
have them together Outdoors than indoors
 

01:21:25.639 --> 01:21:27.030 align:start position:0%
have them together Outdoors than indoors
so

01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
so
 

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:30.950 align:start position:0%
so
um<01:21:28.040><c> I</c><01:21:28.800><c> I</c><01:21:28.960><c> think</c><01:21:29.159><c> it</c><01:21:29.280><c> would</c><01:21:29.480><c> be</c><01:21:29.679><c> very</c><01:21:29.960><c> hard</c><01:21:30.159><c> to</c>

01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I I think it would be very hard to
 

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:35.350 align:start position:0%
um I I think it would be very hard to
prove<01:21:31.960><c> that</c><01:21:32.120><c> many</c><01:21:32.400><c> people</c><01:21:32.719><c> got</c><01:21:32.880><c> sick</c><01:21:33.159><c> being</c>

01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
prove that many people got sick being
 

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.750 align:start position:0%
prove that many people got sick being

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%

so<01:44:42.560><c> containment</c><01:44:43.400><c> may</c><01:44:43.679><c> be</c><01:44:43.960><c> more</c><01:44:44.280><c> appropriate</c>

there's other containments um but I

01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
think you mentioned earlier that the n95
 

01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:17.709 align:start position:0%

02:06:05.679 --> 02:06:07.310 align:start position:0%
specific questions just interrupt me and
I<02:06:05.760><c> think</c><02:06:05.920><c> we'll</c><02:06:06.079><c> have</c><02:06:06.199><c> a</c><02:06:06.400><c> question</c><02:06:06.920><c> Q&amp;A</c>

02:06:07.310 --> 02:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
I think we'll have a question Q&amp;A
 

02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:11.229 align:start position:0%
I think we'll have a question Q&amp;A

outbreaks in Northern Italy and which
 

02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:24.589 align:start position:0%
outbreaks in Northern Italy and which

02:06:24.589 --> 02:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
was the first places outside of
 

02:06:24.599 --> 02:06:27.310 align:start position:0%
was the first places outside of
China<02:06:25.599><c> um</c><02:06:25.760><c> I</c><02:06:25.880><c> was</c><02:06:26.040><c> kind</c><02:06:26.199><c> of</c><02:06:26.360><c> scared</c><02:06:26.880><c> for</c><02:06:27.119><c> about</c>

02:06:27.310 --> 02:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
China um I was kind of scared for about
 

02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:31.390 align:start position:0%
China um I was kind of scared for about
10<02:06:27.520><c> 20</c><02:06:28.320><c> minutes</c><02:06:29.320><c> um</c><02:06:30.320><c> because</c><02:06:30.760><c> I</c><02:06:30.880><c> went</c><02:06:31.079><c> to</c><02:06:31.239><c> look</c>

02:06:31.390 --> 02:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
10 20 minutes um because I went to look
 

02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:33.510 align:start position:0%
10 20 minutes um because I went to look
at<02:06:31.520><c> the</c><02:06:31.639><c> data</c><02:06:31.880><c> from</c><02:06:32.040><c> vuhan</c><02:06:32.840><c> at</c><02:06:33.079><c> at</c><02:06:33.199><c> this</c><02:06:33.360><c> time</c>

02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
at the data from vuhan at at this time
 

02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:35.189 align:start position:0%
at the data from vuhan at at this time
there<02:06:33.639><c> was</c><02:06:33.800><c> no</c><02:06:34.000><c> death</c><02:06:34.239><c> I</c><02:06:34.320><c> think</c><02:06:34.480><c> in</c><02:06:34.599><c> the</c><02:06:34.719><c> US</c><02:06:35.040><c> so</c>

02:06:35.189 --> 02:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
there was no death I think in the US so
 

02:06:35.199 --> 02:06:36.790 align:start position:0%
there was no death I think in the US so
I<02:06:35.280><c> looked</c><02:06:35.480><c> at</c><02:06:35.559><c> the</c><02:06:35.719><c> mortality</c><02:06:36.199><c> in</c><02:06:36.320><c> the</c><02:06:36.440><c> vuhan</c>

02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
I looked at the mortality in the vuhan
 

02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:39.390 align:start position:0%
I looked at the mortality in the vuhan
and<02:06:36.960><c> obviously</c><02:06:37.280><c> everybody</c><02:06:37.639><c> would</c><02:06:37.800><c> be</c><02:06:38.400><c> exposed</c>

02:06:39.390 --> 02:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
and obviously everybody would be exposed
 

02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:43.790 align:start position:0%
and obviously everybody would be exposed
but<02:06:40.480><c> uh</c><02:06:41.480><c> there's</c><02:06:41.840><c> a</c><02:06:42.800><c> I</c><02:06:42.920><c> looked</c><02:06:43.119><c> at</c><02:06:43.320><c> the</c><02:06:43.440><c> age</c><02:06:43.639><c> of</c>

02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
but uh there's a I looked at the age of
 

02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:45.549 align:start position:0%
but uh there's a I looked at the age of
the<02:06:43.880><c> people</c><02:06:44.079><c> who</c><02:06:44.199><c> died</c><02:06:44.400><c> in</c><02:06:44.559><c> vuhan</c><02:06:45.239><c> and</c><02:06:45.360><c> there</c>

02:06:45.549 --> 02:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
the people who died in vuhan and there
 

02:06:45.559 --> 02:06:48.069 align:start position:0%
the people who died in vuhan and there
was<02:06:45.679><c> mostly</c><02:06:45.960><c> older</c><02:06:46.360><c> people</c><02:06:47.159><c> so</c><02:06:47.360><c> I</c><02:06:47.440><c> did</c><02:06:47.679><c> a</c><02:06:47.920><c> a</c>

02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
was mostly older people so I did a a
 

02:06:48.079 --> 02:06:51.189 align:start position:0%
was mostly older people so I did a a
little<02:06:48.440><c> calculation</c><02:06:49.440><c> to</c><02:06:49.639><c> see</c><02:06:50.639><c> we</c><02:06:50.760><c> didn't</c><02:06:50.960><c> know</c>

02:06:51.189 --> 02:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
little calculation to see we didn't know
 

02:06:51.199 --> 02:06:53.629 align:start position:0%
little calculation to see we didn't know
then<02:06:51.719><c> the</c><02:06:52.079><c> the</c><02:06:52.559><c> the</c><02:06:52.800><c> absolute</c><02:06:53.199><c> magnitud</c><02:06:53.599><c> of</c>

02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
then the the the absolute magnitud of
 

02:06:53.639 --> 02:06:54.990 align:start position:0%
then the the the absolute magnitud of
the<02:06:53.800><c> risk</c><02:06:54.000><c> but</c><02:06:54.119><c> I</c><02:06:54.239><c> could</c><02:06:54.559><c> look</c><02:06:54.719><c> at</c><02:06:54.880><c> the</c>

02:06:54.990 --> 02:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
the risk but I could look at the
 

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.830 align:start position:0%
the risk but I could look at the
relative<02:06:55.760><c> risk</c><02:06:56.760><c> different</c><02:06:57.040><c> age</c><02:06:57.280><c> group</c><02:06:57.599><c> and</c><02:06:57.719><c> it</c>

02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
relative risk different age group and it
 

02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:00.030 align:start position:0%
relative risk different age group and it
was<02:06:58.040><c> clear</c><02:06:58.480><c> that</c><02:06:59.119><c> there</c><02:06:59.239><c> were</c><02:06:59.400><c> more</c><02:06:59.639><c> than</c><02:06:59.760><c> a</c>

02:07:00.030 --> 02:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
was clear that there were more than a
 

02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:02.069 align:start position:0%
was clear that there were more than a
thousandfold<02:07:01.040><c> difference</c><02:07:01.440><c> in</c><02:07:01.599><c> mortality</c>

02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
thousandfold difference in mortality
 

02:07:02.079 --> 02:07:04.470 align:start position:0%
thousandfold difference in mortality
risk<02:07:02.320><c> between</c><02:07:02.559><c> the</c><02:07:02.679><c> oldest</c><02:07:03.400><c> and</c><02:07:03.559><c> the</c><02:07:03.679><c> youngest</c>

02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
risk between the oldest and the youngest
 

02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:06.750 align:start position:0%
risk between the oldest and the youngest
people<02:07:05.480><c> so</c><02:07:05.679><c> that's</c><02:07:05.880><c> very</c><02:07:06.079><c> important</c><02:07:06.400><c> to</c><02:07:06.520><c> know</c>

02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
people so that's very important to know
 

02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:08.430 align:start position:0%
people so that's very important to know
when<02:07:06.920><c> you</c><02:07:07.239><c> decide</c><02:07:07.639><c> what</c><02:07:07.719><c> to</c><02:07:07.840><c> do</c><02:07:08.000><c> about</c><02:07:08.199><c> it</c>

02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
when you decide what to do about it
 

02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:10.189 align:start position:0%
when you decide what to do about it
because<02:07:08.880><c> it</c><02:07:09.040><c> basically</c><02:07:09.400><c> means</c><02:07:09.679><c> we</c><02:07:09.840><c> have</c><02:07:09.960><c> to</c><02:07:10.079><c> do</c>

02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
because it basically means we have to do
 

02:07:10.199 --> 02:07:11.830 align:start position:0%
because it basically means we have to do
a<02:07:10.360><c> really</c><02:07:10.599><c> good</c><02:07:10.800><c> job</c><02:07:11.040><c> protecting</c><02:07:11.440><c> all</c><02:07:11.639><c> the</c>

02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
a really good job protecting all the
 

02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:14.589 align:start position:0%
a really good job protecting all the
people<02:07:12.480><c> because</c><02:07:12.679><c> they</c><02:07:12.840><c> at</c><02:07:13.000><c> high</c><02:07:13.360><c> risk</c><02:07:14.360><c> but</c><02:07:14.520><c> we</c>

02:07:14.589 --> 02:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
people because they at high risk but we
 

02:07:14.599 --> 02:07:17.229 align:start position:0%
people because they at high risk but we
don't<02:07:14.800><c> have</c><02:07:14.920><c> to</c><02:07:15.040><c> worry</c><02:07:15.360><c> about</c><02:07:16.360><c> uh</c><02:07:16.480><c> the</c><02:07:16.639><c> kids</c><02:07:17.079><c> so</c>

02:07:17.229 --> 02:07:17.239 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about uh the kids so
 

02:07:17.239 --> 02:07:19.149 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about uh the kids so
the<02:07:17.360><c> reason</c><02:07:17.599><c> I</c><02:07:17.719><c> was</c><02:07:17.880><c> only</c><02:07:18.159><c> afraid</c><02:07:18.440><c> for</c><02:07:18.639><c> 10</c><02:07:18.920><c> 20</c>

02:07:19.149 --> 02:07:19.159 align:start position:0%
the reason I was only afraid for 10 20
 

02:07:19.159 --> 02:07:21.350 align:start position:0%
the reason I was only afraid for 10 20
minutes<02:07:19.520><c> was</c><02:07:19.760><c> because</c><02:07:20.079><c> I</c><02:07:20.199><c> have</c><02:07:20.360><c> three</c><02:07:20.679><c> kids</c><02:07:21.239><c> uh</c>

02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
minutes was because I have three kids uh
 

02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:23.310 align:start position:0%
minutes was because I have three kids uh
as<02:07:21.520><c> as</c><02:07:21.679><c> every</c><02:07:21.880><c> parent</c><02:07:22.239><c> I'm</c><02:07:22.440><c> much</c><02:07:22.639><c> more</c>

02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
as as every parent I'm much more
 

02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:25.549 align:start position:0%
as as every parent I'm much more
concerned<02:07:23.760><c> about</c><02:07:24.000><c> my</c><02:07:24.119><c> children</c><02:07:24.480><c> than</c><02:07:24.679><c> myself</c>

02:07:25.549 --> 02:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
concerned about my children than myself
 

02:07:25.559 --> 02:07:26.629 align:start position:0%
concerned about my children than myself
so<02:07:25.719><c> I</c><02:07:25.800><c> knew</c><02:07:26.000><c> that</c><02:07:26.079><c> they</c><02:07:26.159><c> were</c><02:07:26.280><c> going</c><02:07:26.400><c> to</c><02:07:26.480><c> be</c>

02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
so I knew that they were going to be
 

02:07:26.639 --> 02:07:31.229 align:start position:0%
so I knew that they were going to be
fine<02:07:27.159><c> I</c><02:07:27.239><c> didn't</c><02:07:27.440><c> have</c><02:07:27.559><c> to</c><02:07:27.639><c> worry</c><02:07:27.880><c> about</c>

were empty and a lot of hosp during the
covid<02:16:03.880><c> uh</c><02:16:04.119><c> so</c><02:16:04.360><c> some</c><02:16:04.559><c> hospitals</c><02:16:05.040><c> overwhelmed</c>

02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%

02:16:06.589 --> 02:16:06.599 align:start position:0%
like in New York for example in the
 

02:16:06.599 --> 02:16:08.270 align:start position:0%
like in New York for example in the

02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
spring of 2020 they were quite
 

02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:11.350 align:start position:0%
spring of 2020 they were quite

02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed in New York City but uh in
 

02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:13.589 align:start position:0%

2018 um and so on and then suddenly in

02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:37.629 align:start position:0%
2020 it plummets and again that's not

02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
can covid death you can Define in
 

02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:33.190 align:start position:0%
can covid death you can Define in

02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:33.200 align:start position:0%

02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:35.750 align:start position:0%
different ways so there can be VAR with

02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
that but a death is a death uh so
 

02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:37.790 align:start position:0%
that but a death is a death uh so

very<02:32:05.279><c> high</c><02:32:05.439><c> vaccination</c><02:32:05.960><c> rate</c><02:32:06.439><c> and</c><02:32:06.640><c> they</c><02:32:06.800><c> used</c>

02:32:07.230 --> 02:32:07.240 align:start position:0%
very high vaccination rate and they used
 

02:32:07.240 --> 02:32:10.469 align:start position:0%
very high vaccination rate and they used
fiser<02:32:07.800><c> modna</c><02:32:08.600><c> and</c><02:32:09.160><c> astrazenica</c><02:32:10.160><c> which</c><02:32:10.279><c> is</c>

02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
fiser modna and astrazenica which is
 

02:32:10.479 --> 02:32:12.950 align:start position:0%
fiser modna and astrazenica which is
different<02:32:10.760><c> from</c><02:32:10.920><c> the</c><02:32:11.120><c> US</c><02:32:11.600><c> which</c><02:32:11.800><c> used</c><02:32:12.200><c> fiser</c>

02:32:12.950 --> 02:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
different from the US which used fiser
 

02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:16.190 align:start position:0%
different from the US which used fiser
modna<02:32:13.960><c> and</c><02:32:14.279><c> Johnson</c><02:32:14.640><c> and</c><02:32:14.800><c> Johnson</c><02:32:15.479><c> astroica</c>

02:32:16.190 --> 02:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
modna and Johnson and Johnson astroica
 

02:32:16.200 --> 02:32:18.830 align:start position:0%
modna and Johnson and Johnson astroica
was<02:32:16.359><c> not</c><02:32:16.520><c> never</c><02:32:16.760><c> approved</c><02:32:17.120><c> in</c><02:32:17.240><c> the</c>

02:32:18.830 --> 02:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
was not never approved in the
 

02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:21.349 align:start position:0%
was not never approved in the
US

02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
US
 

02:32:21.359 --> 02:32:23.030 align:start position:0%
US
and<02:32:21.960><c> that</c><02:32:22.120><c> actually</c><02:32:22.359><c> a</c><02:32:22.479><c> good</c><02:32:22.680><c> question</c>

02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
and that actually a good question
 

02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:29.110 align:start position:0%
and that actually a good question
because<02:32:23.680><c> that</c><02:32:24.080><c> could</c><02:32:25.080><c> uh</c><02:32:25.240><c> make</c><02:32:25.399><c> a</c><02:32:26.000><c> difference</c>

02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
 

02:32:29.120 --> 02:32:32.469 align:start position:0%
 
so<02:32:30.120><c> uh</c><02:32:30.479><c> but</c><02:32:30.640><c> one</c><02:32:30.840><c> reason</c><02:32:31.120><c> that</c><02:32:31.279><c> Sweden</c><02:32:31.600><c> is</c><02:32:31.880><c> very</c>

02:32:32.469 --> 02:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
so uh but one reason that Sweden is very
 

02:32:32.479 --> 02:32:36.830 align:start position:0%
so uh but one reason that Sweden is very
very<02:32:33.080><c> uh</c><02:32:33.800><c> did</c><02:32:34.080><c> well</c><02:32:34.399><c> was</c><02:32:34.680><c> because</c><02:32:35.240><c> of</c><02:32:35.520><c> this</c><02:32:36.319><c> uh</c>

02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
very uh did well was because of this uh
 

02:32:36.840 --> 02:32:39.349 align:start position:0%
very uh did well was because of this uh
vaccinations<02:32:37.840><c> and</c><02:32:38.359><c> focusing</c><02:32:38.800><c> on</c><02:32:38.920><c> the</c><02:32:39.040><c> older</c>

02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and focusing on the older
 

02:32:39.359 --> 02:32:43.309 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and focusing on the older
people<02:32:39.560><c> to</c><02:32:39.680><c> get</c><02:32:39.880><c> vac</c>

02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
 

02:32:43.319 --> 02:32:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
vaccinated

02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 

02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:51.590 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
uh<02:32:47.080><c> so</c><02:32:47.960><c> this</c><02:32:48.840><c> is</c><02:32:49.960><c> another</c><02:32:50.359><c> exess</c><02:32:50.760><c> death</c><02:32:51.000><c> in</c>

02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh so this is another exess death in
 

02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:54.950 align:start position:0%
uh so this is another exess death in
Europe<02:32:52.600><c> uh</c><02:32:52.720><c> where</c><02:32:52.880><c> Sweden</c><02:32:53.240><c> is</c><02:32:53.359><c> the</c><02:32:53.560><c> lowest</c><02:32:54.560><c> now</c>

02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
Europe uh where Sweden is the lowest now
 

02:32:54.960 --> 02:32:56.830 align:start position:0%
Europe uh where Sweden is the lowest now
when<02:32:55.120><c> we</c><02:32:55.240><c> look</c><02:32:55.399><c> at</c><02:32:55.600><c> exess</c><02:32:56.040><c> deaths</c><02:32:56.399><c> you</c><02:32:56.560><c> can</c>

02:32:56.830 --> 02:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
when we look at exess deaths you can
 

02:32:56.840 --> 02:32:58.150 align:start position:0%
when we look at exess deaths you can
calculate<02:32:57.279><c> a</c><02:32:57.359><c> little</c><02:32:57.479><c> bit</c><02:32:57.640><c> different</c><02:32:57.920><c> ways</c>

02:32:58.150 --> 02:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
calculate a little bit different ways
 

02:32:58.160 --> 02:32:59.670 align:start position:0%
calculate a little bit different ways
what<02:32:58.319><c> typically</c><02:32:58.640><c> you</c><02:32:58.720><c> do</c><02:32:58.880><c> for</c><02:32:59.080><c> Access</c><02:32:59.439><c> death</c>

02:32:59.670 --> 02:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
what typically you do for Access death
 

02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:02.830 align:start position:0%
what typically you do for Access death
is<02:32:59.800><c> you</c><02:32:59.920><c> look</c><02:33:00.160><c> at</c><02:33:01.160><c> the</c><02:33:01.359><c> total</c><02:33:01.680><c> death</c><02:33:01.920><c> in</c><02:33:02.080><c> 2020</c>

02:33:02.830 --> 02:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
is you look at the total death in 2020
 

02:33:02.840 --> 02:33:04.830 align:start position:0%
is you look at the total death in 2020
and<02:33:03.000><c> 22</c><02:33:03.560><c> and</c><02:33:03.640><c> then</c><02:33:03.760><c> you</c><02:33:03.920><c> compare</c><02:33:04.319><c> it</c><02:33:04.680><c> what</c>

02:33:04.830 --> 02:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
and 22 and then you compare it what
 

02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:08.349 align:start position:0%
and 22 and then you compare it what
would<02:33:05.000><c> it</c><02:33:05.800><c> been</c><02:33:06.040><c> if</c><02:33:06.319><c> were</c><02:33:06.520><c> the</c><02:33:06.680><c> same</c><02:33:07.479><c> rate</c><02:33:08.000><c> in</c>

02:33:08.349 --> 02:33:08.359 align:start position:0%
would it been if were the same rate in
 

02:33:08.359 --> 02:33:10.670 align:start position:0%
would it been if were the same rate in
the<02:33:08.600><c> prior</c><02:33:08.960><c> three</c><02:33:09.160><c> years</c><02:33:09.479><c> like</c>

02:33:10.670 --> 02:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
the prior three years like
 

02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:15.150 align:start position:0%
the prior three years like
201<02:33:11.680><c> uh</c><02:33:12.040><c> 17</c><02:33:12.560><c> 18</c><02:33:12.880><c> and</c><02:33:13.279><c> 19</c><02:33:14.279><c> but</c><02:33:14.439><c> you</c><02:33:14.520><c> can</c><02:33:14.720><c> also</c>

02:33:15.150 --> 02:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
201 uh 17 18 and 19 but you can also
 

02:33:15.160 --> 02:33:18.230 align:start position:0%
201 uh 17 18 and 19 but you can also
select<02:33:15.520><c> a</c><02:33:15.720><c> prior</c><02:33:16.080><c> five</c><02:33:16.319><c> years</c><02:33:16.600><c> for</c><02:33:17.080><c> example</c><02:33:18.080><c> or</c>

02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
select a prior five years for example or
 

02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:19.469 align:start position:0%
select a prior five years for example or
you<02:33:18.319><c> can</c><02:33:18.520><c> start</c><02:33:18.720><c> to</c><02:33:18.840><c> put</c><02:33:18.960><c> a</c><02:33:19.080><c> little</c><02:33:19.240><c> bit</c><02:33:19.359><c> of</c><02:33:19.399><c> a</c>

02:33:19.469 --> 02:33:19.479 align:start position:0%
you can start to put a little bit of a
 

02:33:19.479 --> 02:33:21.670 align:start position:0%
you can start to put a little bit of a
trend<02:33:19.880><c> line</c><02:33:20.319><c> so</c><02:33:20.560><c> depending</c><02:33:20.920><c> on</c><02:33:21.120><c> what</c><02:33:21.279><c> methods</c>

02:33:21.670 --> 02:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
trend line so depending on what methods
 

02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:24.590 align:start position:0%
trend line so depending on what methods
you<02:33:21.880><c> use</c><02:33:22.279><c> the</c><02:33:22.800><c> exact</c><02:33:23.120><c> numbers</c><02:33:23.479><c> are</c><02:33:23.640><c> going</c><02:33:23.720><c> to</c>

02:33:24.590 --> 02:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
you use the exact numbers are going to
 

02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:26.349 align:start position:0%
you use the exact numbers are going to
vary<02:33:24.840><c> a</c><02:33:24.960><c> little</c><02:33:25.160><c> bit</c><02:33:25.439><c> and</c><02:33:25.560><c> the</c><02:33:25.720><c> exact</c><02:33:26.000><c> order</c>

02:33:26.349 --> 02:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
vary a little bit and the exact order
 

02:33:26.359 --> 02:33:27.910 align:start position:0%
vary a little bit and the exact order
will<02:33:26.479><c> vary</c><02:33:26.680><c> a</c><02:33:26.760><c> little</c><02:33:26.920><c> bit</c><02:33:27.200><c> but</c><02:33:27.319><c> the</c><02:33:27.479><c> basic</c>

02:33:27.910 --> 02:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
will vary a little bit but the basic
 

02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:30.590 align:start position:0%
will vary a little bit but the basic
picture<02:33:28.200><c> is</c><02:33:28.399><c> the</c><02:33:28.800><c> same</c><02:33:29.800><c> uh</c><02:33:30.080><c> so</c><02:33:30.279><c> I</c><02:33:30.359><c> think</c>

02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
picture is the same uh so I think
 

02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:33.230 align:start position:0%
picture is the same uh so I think
there's<02:33:31.600><c> some</c><02:33:31.840><c> models</c><02:33:32.160><c> you</c><02:33:32.319><c> use</c><02:33:32.600><c> Norway</c><02:33:33.040><c> will</c>

02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
there's some models you use Norway will
 

02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:36.510 align:start position:0%
there's some models you use Norway will
actually<02:33:34.160><c> be</c><02:33:34.720><c> slightly</c><02:33:35.120><c> better</c><02:33:35.359><c> than</c><02:33:35.520><c> Sweden</c>

02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
actually be slightly better than Sweden
 

02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:40.110 align:start position:0%
actually be slightly better than Sweden
so<02:33:37.000><c> uh</c><02:33:37.560><c> but</c><02:33:37.840><c> this</c><02:33:38.080><c> particular</c><02:33:39.000><c> uh</c><02:33:39.439><c> one</c><02:33:39.760><c> Sweden</c>

02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
so uh but this particular uh one Sweden
 

02:33:40.120 --> 02:33:42.269 align:start position:0%
so uh but this particular uh one Sweden
was<02:33:40.279><c> the</c><02:33:40.399><c> lowest</c><02:33:40.800><c> and</c><02:33:41.000><c> Bulgaria</c><02:33:41.600><c> was</c><02:33:41.760><c> the</c>

02:33:42.269 --> 02:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
was the lowest and Bulgaria was the
 

02:33:42.279 --> 02:33:45.429 align:start position:0%
was the lowest and Bulgaria was the
worst<02:33:43.279><c> uh</c><02:33:43.439><c> UK</c><02:33:44.120><c> is</c><02:33:44.279><c> not</c><02:33:44.520><c> and</c><02:33:44.680><c> us</c><02:33:44.960><c> are</c><02:33:45.120><c> not</c><02:33:45.279><c> in</c>

02:33:45.429 --> 02:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
worst uh UK is not and us are not in
 

02:33:45.439 --> 02:33:48.710 align:start position:0%
worst uh UK is not and us are not in
this<02:33:45.640><c> graph</c><02:33:45.960><c> but</c><02:33:46.120><c> UK</c><02:33:46.439><c> had</c><02:33:46.600><c> 10%</c><02:33:47.240><c> and</c><02:33:47.399><c> US</c>

02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
this graph but UK had 10% and US
 

02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:52.750 align:start position:0%
this graph but UK had 10% and US
14%<02:33:49.800><c> so</c><02:33:49.960><c> us</c><02:33:50.279><c> was</c><02:33:50.600><c> by</c><02:33:50.880><c> far</c><02:33:51.200><c> the</c><02:33:51.399><c> worst</c><02:33:52.120><c> but</c><02:33:52.479><c> also</c>

02:33:52.750 --> 02:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
14% so us was by far the worst but also
 

02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:54.550 align:start position:0%
14% so us was by far the worst but also
by<02:33:52.920><c> far</c><02:33:53.160><c> the</c>

chair um back to the previous slide if I
may<02:34:02.960><c> so</c><02:34:03.279><c> that's</c><02:34:03.520><c> the</c><02:34:03.680><c> death</c><02:34:04.000><c> rates</c><02:34:04.840><c> um</c><02:34:05.200><c> is</c><02:34:05.399><c> the</c>

02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
may so that's the death rates um is the
 

02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:10.230 align:start position:0%
may so that's the death rates um is the

02:34:10.230 --> 02:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates there as well so is
 

02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:13.030 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates there as well so is

02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
the mortality rate so is there slides
 

02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:14.950 align:start position:0%
the mortality rate so is there slides
later<02:34:13.319><c> on</c><02:34:13.520><c> to</c><02:34:13.760><c> talk</c><02:34:13.960><c> about</c><02:34:14.160><c> the</c><02:34:14.359><c> vaccination</c>

no slide for that now you don't thank I
 

02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:20.630 align:start position:0%
no slide for that now you don't thank I
could<02:34:19.399><c> talk</c><02:34:19.560><c> about</c><02:34:19.760><c> about</c><02:34:20.000><c> vaccines</c><02:34:20.439><c> because</c>

02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
could talk about about vaccines because
 

02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:24.110 align:start position:0%
could talk about about vaccines because
they<02:34:20.760><c> work</c><02:34:21.000><c> with</c><02:34:21.200><c> vaccines</c><02:34:21.600><c> but</c><02:34:21.760><c> I</c><02:34:22.319><c> haven't</c><02:34:23.319><c> uh</c>

02:34:24.110 --> 02:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
they work with vaccines but I haven't uh
 

02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:27.510 align:start position:0%
they work with vaccines but I haven't uh
I<02:34:24.240><c> have</c><02:34:24.560><c> I</c><02:34:24.840><c> I</c><02:34:25.120><c> I</c><02:34:25.200><c> think</c><02:34:25.479><c> that</c><02:34:26.200><c> that</c><02:34:26.319><c> wasn't</c><02:34:26.760><c> my</c>

02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
I have I I I think that that wasn't my
 

02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:29.670 align:start position:0%
I have I I I think that that wasn't my
request<02:34:28.000><c> to</c><02:34:28.120><c> do</c><02:34:28.319><c> that</c>

02:34:29.670 --> 02:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
request to do that
 

02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:32.910 align:start position:0%
request to do that
so<02:34:30.680><c> uh</c><02:34:30.840><c> this</c><02:34:30.960><c> is</c><02:34:31.160><c> just</c><02:34:31.800><c> all</c><02:34:32.120><c> cost</c><02:34:32.399><c> morality</c><02:34:32.800><c> in</c>

02:34:32.910 --> 02:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
so uh this is just all cost morality in
 

02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:34.990 align:start position:0%
so uh this is just all cost morality in
Sweden<02:34:33.319><c> through</c><02:34:33.800><c> many</c><02:34:34.120><c> years</c><02:34:34.600><c> and</c><02:34:34.720><c> you</c><02:34:34.840><c> can</c>

02:34:34.990 --> 02:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
Sweden through many years and you can
 

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:35.870 align:start position:0%
Sweden through many years and you can
see

02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
see
 

02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:38.070 align:start position:0%
see
that

02:34:38.070 --> 02:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
that
 

02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:42.110 align:start position:0%
that
um<02:34:39.080><c> it</c><02:34:39.240><c> would</c><02:34:39.399><c> have</c><02:34:39.520><c> been</c><02:34:39.640><c> going</c><02:34:40.279><c> down</c><02:34:41.279><c> 2018</c>

02:34:42.110 --> 02:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
um it would have been going down 2018
 

02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:44.750 align:start position:0%
um it would have been going down 2018
and<02:34:42.279><c> 19</c><02:34:42.680><c> That</c><02:34:42.840><c> season</c><02:34:43.160><c> was</c><02:34:43.359><c> very</c><02:34:43.520><c> low</c><02:34:43.800><c> 201920</c>

02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:46.230 align:start position:0%

it<02:34:44.880><c> went</c><02:34:45.000><c> a</c><02:34:45.080><c> little</c><02:34:45.200><c> bit</c><02:34:45.399><c> up</c><02:34:45.720><c> and</c><02:34:45.800><c> then</c><02:34:45.920><c> it</c><02:34:46.040><c> went</c>

02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
it went a little bit up and then it went
 

02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:48.750 align:start position:0%
it went a little bit up and then it went

pandemic uh now when we do all excess
death<02:34:57.680><c> we</c><02:34:58.240><c> compare</c><02:34:59.240><c> some</c><02:34:59.560><c> years</c><02:35:00.080><c> now</c><02:35:00.479><c> between</c>

has the oldest population in the US so

have that's doesn't really to me
 

02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:22.830 align:start position:0%
have that's doesn't really to me
comparing<02:40:20.760><c> one</c><02:40:21.040><c> data</c><02:40:21.399><c> point</c><02:40:21.920><c> and</c><02:40:22.120><c> using</c><02:40:22.520><c> that</c>

comparing one data point and using that
 

02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:24.590 align:start position:0%
comparing one data point and using that
as<02:40:22.920><c> a</c><02:40:23.200><c> basis</c><02:40:23.640><c> doesn't</c>

02:40:24.590 --> 02:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
as a basis doesn't
 

02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:27.389 align:start position:0%
as a basis doesn't

02:40:27.389 --> 02:40:27.399 align:start position:0%
really Jive you know what I mean yeah so
 

02:40:27.399 --> 02:40:28.389 align:start position:0%
really Jive you know what I mean yeah so
there<02:40:27.560><c> could</c><02:40:27.680><c> be</c><02:40:27.840><c> you're</c><02:40:28.000><c> right</c><02:40:28.160><c> there</c><02:40:28.279><c> could</c>

02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
there could be you're right there could
 

02:40:28.399 --> 02:40:32.429 align:start position:0%
there could be you're right there could
be<02:40:28.560><c> very</c><02:40:28.760><c> other</c><02:40:29.000><c> things</c><02:40:29.200><c> so</c><02:40:29.800><c> maybe</c><02:40:30.920><c> uh</c><02:40:31.920><c> nor</c>

02:40:32.429 --> 02:40:32.439 align:start position:0%
be very other things so maybe uh nor
 

02:40:32.439 --> 02:40:34.389 align:start position:0%
be very other things so maybe uh nor
maybe<02:40:32.680><c> South</c><02:40:33.000><c> Dakota</c><02:40:33.359><c> did</c><02:40:33.520><c> something</c><02:40:33.800><c> else</c>

02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
maybe South Dakota did something else
 

02:40:34.399 --> 02:40:36.030 align:start position:0%
maybe South Dakota did something else
that<02:40:34.560><c> really</c><02:40:34.840><c> lowered</c><02:40:35.319><c> the</c><02:40:35.520><c> maybe</c><02:40:35.760><c> they</c><02:40:35.880><c> have</c>

02:40:36.030 --> 02:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
that really lowered the maybe they have
 

02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:38.070 align:start position:0%
that really lowered the maybe they have
better<02:40:36.240><c> Healthcare</c><02:40:36.640><c> or</c><02:40:36.760><c> something</c><02:40:37.000><c> like</c><02:40:37.200><c> that</c>

02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
better Healthcare or something like that
 

02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:40.790 align:start position:0%
better Healthcare or something like that
so<02:40:38.600><c> my</c><02:40:38.760><c> only</c><02:40:39.080><c> Point</c><02:40:39.439><c> here</c><02:40:39.640><c> is</c><02:40:39.920><c> that</c><02:40:40.359><c> looking</c><02:40:40.640><c> at</c>

02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
so my only Point here is that looking at
 

02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:43.269 align:start position:0%
so my only Point here is that looking at
this<02:40:41.080><c> data</c><02:40:42.040><c> where</c><02:40:42.240><c> there</c><02:40:42.359><c> a</c><02:40:42.479><c> lot</c><02:40:42.600><c> of</c><02:40:42.760><c> factors</c>

02:40:43.269 --> 02:40:43.279 align:start position:0%
this data where there a lot of factors
 

02:40:43.279 --> 02:40:45.110 align:start position:0%
this data where there a lot of factors
influencing<02:40:43.760><c> it</c><02:40:44.040><c> there's</c><02:40:44.279><c> no</c><02:40:44.520><c> evidence</c><02:40:44.920><c> that</c>

02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
influencing it there's no evidence that
 

02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:46.950 align:start position:0%
influencing it there's no evidence that
the<02:40:45.600><c> the</c><02:40:45.720><c> states</c><02:40:46.040><c> who</c><02:40:46.200><c> didn't</c><02:40:46.399><c> lock</c><02:40:46.680><c> down</c><02:40:46.840><c> that</c>

02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
the the states who didn't lock down that
 

02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:49.630 align:start position:0%
the the states who didn't lock down that
they<02:40:47.040><c> did</c><02:40:47.240><c> any</c><02:40:47.439><c> worse</c><02:40:47.640><c> than</c><02:40:48.240><c> others</c><02:40:49.439><c> when</c><02:40:49.520><c> it</c>

02:40:49.630 --> 02:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
they did any worse than others when it
 

02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:53.309 align:start position:0%
they did any worse than others when it
comes<02:40:49.800><c> to</c><02:40:49.920><c> co</c><02:40:50.240><c> mortality</c><02:40:51.240><c> uh</c><02:40:51.479><c> represent</c><02:40:51.920><c> Penza</c>

02:40:53.309 --> 02:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
comes to co mortality uh represent Penza
 

02:40:53.319 --> 02:40:56.790 align:start position:0%
comes to co mortality uh represent Penza
yeah<02:40:54.319><c> so</c><02:40:54.600><c> I'm</c><02:40:54.880><c> very</c><02:40:55.319><c> familiar</c><02:40:55.840><c> with</c><02:40:56.319><c> um</c><02:40:56.479><c> so</c><02:40:56.720><c> it</c>

02:40:56.790 --> 02:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm very familiar with um so it
 

02:40:56.800 --> 02:40:59.630 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm very familiar with um so it
was<02:40:56.960><c> early</c><02:40:57.279><c> on</c><02:40:57.560><c> in</c><02:40:57.880><c> in</c><02:40:58.080><c> 2020</c><02:40:59.080><c> um</c><02:40:59.399><c> when</c><02:40:59.560><c> the</c>

02:40:59.630 --> 02:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
was early on in in 2020 um when the
 

02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:02.550 align:start position:0%
was early on in in 2020 um when the
schools<02:41:00.000><c> closed</c><02:41:00.359><c> down</c><02:41:01.040><c> U</c><02:41:01.359><c> and</c><02:41:01.520><c> I</c><02:41:01.720><c> watched</c><02:41:02.240><c> very</c>

02:41:02.550 --> 02:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
schools closed down U and I watched very
 

02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:05.349 align:start position:0%
schools closed down U and I watched very
closely<02:41:03.200><c> about</c><02:41:03.439><c> what</c><02:41:03.600><c> happened</c><02:41:03.920><c> in</c><02:41:04.120><c> Sweden</c><02:41:05.120><c> um</c>

02:41:05.349 --> 02:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
closely about what happened in Sweden um
 

02:41:05.359 --> 02:41:07.870 align:start position:0%
closely about what happened in Sweden um
shared<02:41:05.800><c> that</c><02:41:06.120><c> a</c><02:41:06.240><c> lot</c><02:41:06.399><c> of</c><02:41:06.520><c> that</c><02:41:06.680><c> information</c><02:41:07.600><c> I</c>

02:41:07.870 --> 02:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
shared that a lot of that information I
 

02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:10.550 align:start position:0%
shared that a lot of that information I
I<02:41:08.200><c> can</c><02:41:08.479><c> grab</c><02:41:08.760><c> old</c><02:41:09.000><c> emails</c><02:41:09.359><c> I'm</c><02:41:09.520><c> sure</c><02:41:10.160><c> so</c><02:41:10.439><c> I</c>

02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
I can grab old emails I'm sure so I
 

02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:12.150 align:start position:0%
I can grab old emails I'm sure so I
think<02:41:10.760><c> that</c><02:41:10.920><c> the</c><02:41:11.040><c> most</c><02:41:11.319><c> significant</c><02:41:11.960><c> thing</c>

02:41:12.150 --> 02:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
think that the most significant thing
 

02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:14.590 align:start position:0%
think that the most significant thing
and<02:41:12.279><c> I</c><02:41:12.359><c> don't</c><02:41:12.479><c> know</c><02:41:12.600><c> where</c><02:41:12.760><c> that</c><02:41:12.920><c> slide</c><02:41:13.319><c> is</c><02:41:14.240><c> um</c>

02:41:14.590 --> 02:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
and I don't know where that slide is um
 

02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:17.190 align:start position:0%
and I don't know where that slide is um
is<02:41:14.880><c> specifically</c><02:41:15.640><c> about</c><02:41:16.439><c> the</c><02:41:16.600><c> schools</c>

02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
is specifically about the schools
 

02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:20.150 align:start position:0%
is specifically about the schools
because<02:41:17.520><c> that</c><02:41:18.000><c> is</c><02:41:19.000><c> um</c><02:41:19.520><c> you</c><02:41:19.640><c> know</c><02:41:19.880><c> kind</c><02:41:20.000><c> of</c>

02:41:20.150 --> 02:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
because that is um you know kind of
 

02:41:20.160 --> 02:41:22.550 align:start position:0%
because that is um you know kind of

comparing Apples to Apples ones that you
 

02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:25.070 align:start position:0%
comparing Apples to Apples ones that you
know<02:41:22.800><c> without</c><02:41:23.279><c> having</c><02:41:24.040><c> masks</c><02:41:24.479><c> and</c><02:41:24.680><c> all</c><02:41:24.920><c> that</c>

02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
know without having masks and all that
 

02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:26.750 align:start position:0%
know without having masks and all that
if<02:41:25.240><c> you're</c><02:41:25.600><c> you</c><02:41:25.720><c> know</c><02:41:25.840><c> if</c><02:41:25.960><c> you're</c><02:41:26.080><c> sick</c><02:41:26.399><c> stay</c>

02:41:26.750 --> 02:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
if you're you know if you're sick stay
 

02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:29.230 align:start position:0%
if you're you know if you're sick stay
home<02:41:27.040><c> so</c><02:41:27.640><c> could</c><02:41:27.800><c> you</c><02:41:28.040><c> focus</c><02:41:28.399><c> on</c><02:41:28.680><c> that</c><02:41:28.920><c> just</c><02:41:29.080><c> for</c>

02:41:29.230 --> 02:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
home so could you focus on that just for
 

02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:32.469 align:start position:0%
home so could you focus on that just for
a<02:41:29.359><c> little</c><02:41:29.600><c> bit</c><02:41:30.439><c> um</c><02:41:31.000><c> you</c><02:41:31.120><c> know</c><02:41:31.439><c> in</c><02:41:31.960><c> comparing</c>

02:41:32.469 --> 02:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
a little bit um you know in comparing
 

02:41:32.479 --> 02:41:34.790 align:start position:0%
a little bit um you know in comparing
that<02:41:32.680><c> maybe</c><02:41:33.040><c> to</c><02:41:33.760><c> someone</c><02:41:34.080><c> else</c><02:41:34.279><c> that</c><02:41:34.439><c> did</c><02:41:34.640><c> all</c>

02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
that maybe to someone else that did all
 

02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:37.870 align:start position:0%
that maybe to someone else that did all
of<02:41:34.960><c> those</c><02:41:35.279><c> types</c><02:41:35.520><c> of</c>

02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:40.469 align:start position:0%
 
things<02:41:38.880><c> yeah</c><02:41:39.040><c> so</c><02:41:39.240><c> I</c><02:41:39.359><c> think</c><02:41:39.840><c> there's</c><02:41:40.080><c> also</c><02:41:40.279><c> been</c>

02:41:40.469 --> 02:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
things yeah so I think there's also been
 

02:41:40.479 --> 02:41:42.710 align:start position:0%
things yeah so I think there's also been
studies<02:41:40.880><c> showing</c><02:41:41.319><c> that</c><02:41:41.640><c> there's</c><02:41:41.920><c> no</c><02:41:42.160><c> evidence</c>

02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:42.720 align:start position:0%

the worst one of the five worst because
 

02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:20.389 align:start position:0%
the worst one of the five worst because

02:47:20.389 --> 02:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
Texas is a very young population you can
 

02:47:20.399 --> 02:47:21.870 align:start position:0%
Texas is a very young population you can
compare<02:47:20.760><c> that</c><02:47:20.880><c> with</c><02:47:21.040><c> Pennsylvania</c><02:47:21.680><c> which</c><02:47:21.800><c> has</c>

02:47:21.870 --> 02:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
compare that with Pennsylvania which has

02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:27.070 align:start position:0%
a fairly old

02:47:27.070 --> 02:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
population uh the raw rate is 17% above
 

02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:30.349 align:start position:0%
population uh the raw rate is 17% above
the<02:47:27.200><c> national</c><02:47:27.560><c> average</c><02:47:28.760><c> but</c><02:47:29.760><c> uh</c><02:47:29.960><c> the</c><02:47:30.080><c> age</c>

02:47:30.349 --> 02:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
the national average but uh the age
 

02:47:30.359 --> 02:47:33.429 align:start position:0%
the national average but uh the age
adjusted<02:47:30.960><c> is</c><02:47:31.399><c> 2%</c><02:47:32.399><c> so</c><02:47:32.600><c> the</c><02:47:32.720><c> one</c><02:47:32.880><c> to</c><02:47:33.040><c> the</c><02:47:33.200><c> right</c>

02:47:33.429 --> 02:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
adjusted is 2% so the one to the right
 

02:47:33.439 --> 02:47:35.309 align:start position:0%
adjusted is 2% so the one to the right
here<02:47:33.600><c> so</c><02:47:33.840><c> are</c><02:47:34.000><c> the</c><02:47:34.120><c> correct</c><02:47:34.479><c> numbers</c><02:47:35.080><c> and</c><02:47:35.200><c> you</c>

02:47:35.309 --> 02:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
here so are the correct numbers and you
 

02:47:35.319 --> 02:47:39.469 align:start position:0%
here so are the correct numbers and you
can<02:47:35.479><c> see</c><02:47:35.920><c> how</c><02:47:36.680><c> it</c><02:47:36.840><c> can</c><02:47:37.040><c> sort</c><02:47:37.399><c> of</c><02:47:38.399><c> shift</c><02:47:39.000><c> up</c><02:47:39.200><c> or</c>

02:47:39.469 --> 02:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
can see how it can sort of shift up or
 

02:47:39.479 --> 02:47:41.190 align:start position:0%
can see how it can sort of shift up or
down<02:47:40.200><c> quite</c><02:47:40.399><c> a</c>

02:47:41.190 --> 02:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
down quite a
 

02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:43.110 align:start position:0%
down quite a

02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%

02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:48.110 align:start position:0%

um<02:47:44.120><c> New</c><02:47:44.840><c> Hampshire</c><02:47:45.840><c> is</c><02:47:46.560><c> minus</c><02:47:46.960><c> 35</c><02:47:47.560><c> in</c><02:47:47.680><c> the</c><02:47:47.840><c> Raw</c>

02:47:48.110 --> 02:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire is minus 35 in the Raw
 

02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:52.230 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire is minus 35 in the Raw
rates<02:47:48.600><c> but</c><02:47:48.880><c> then</c><02:47:49.080><c> if</c><02:47:49.240><c> you</c><02:47:49.880><c> adjust</c><02:47:50.359><c> for</c><02:47:51.240><c> age</c>

02:47:52.230 --> 02:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
rates but then if you adjust for age
 

02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:55.429 align:start position:0%
rates but then if you adjust for age
it's<02:47:52.800><c> minus</c><02:47:53.279><c> 41</c><02:47:54.279><c> so</c><02:47:54.520><c> that's</c><02:47:54.800><c> because</c><02:47:55.200><c> New</c>

02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's minus 41 so that's because New
 

02:47:55.439 --> 02:47:57.269 align:start position:0%
it's minus 41 so that's because New
Hampshire<02:47:55.840><c> has</c><02:47:55.960><c> an</c><02:47:56.160><c> older</c><02:47:56.600><c> population</c><02:47:57.120><c> than</c>

02:47:57.269 --> 02:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has an older population than
 

02:47:57.279 --> 02:47:58.910 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has an older population than
the<02:47:57.399><c> US</c><02:47:57.720><c> average</c><02:47:58.200><c> therefore</c><02:47:58.479><c> it</c><02:47:58.600><c> sort</c><02:47:58.760><c> of</c>

02:47:58.910 --> 02:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
the US average therefore it sort of
 

02:47:58.920 --> 02:48:00.950 align:start position:0%
the US average therefore it sort of
looks<02:47:59.160><c> better</c><02:47:59.399><c> when</c><02:47:59.479><c> you</c><02:47:59.600><c> age</c><02:47:59.840><c> adjust</c><02:48:00.560><c> so</c><02:48:00.760><c> for</c>

02:48:00.950 --> 02:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
looks better when you age adjust so for
 

02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:02.429 align:start position:0%
looks better when you age adjust so for
some<02:48:01.120><c> states</c><02:48:01.399><c> it</c><02:48:01.560><c> goes</c><02:48:01.800><c> down</c><02:48:02.000><c> and</c><02:48:02.160><c> for</c><02:48:02.319><c> some</c>

small but but one thing is important to
 

02:51:23.080 --> 02:51:26.550 align:start position:0%
small but but one thing is important to
realize<02:51:24.160><c> that</c><02:51:25.160><c> the</c><02:51:25.520><c> temporal</c><02:51:26.000><c> Trends</c><02:51:26.319><c> are</c>

02:51:26.550 --> 02:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
realize that the temporal Trends are
 

02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:28.630 align:start position:0%
realize that the temporal Trends are
different<02:51:26.800><c> to</c><02:51:27.000><c> different</c><02:51:27.319><c> places</c><02:51:28.279><c> so</c><02:51:28.479><c> it</c>

02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
different to different places so it
 

02:51:28.640 --> 02:51:30.349 align:start position:0%
different to different places so it
could<02:51:28.920><c> so</c><02:51:29.279><c> there</c><02:51:29.399><c> were</c><02:51:29.560><c> a</c><02:51:29.680><c> time</c><02:51:29.920><c> for</c><02:51:30.040><c> example</c>

02:51:30.349 --> 02:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
could so there were a time for example
 

02:51:30.359 --> 02:51:31.910 align:start position:0%
could so there were a time for example
where<02:51:30.520><c> Michigan</c><02:51:30.920><c> was</c><02:51:31.080><c> the</c><02:51:31.200><c> highest</c><02:51:31.479><c> in</c><02:51:31.560><c> the</c>

02:51:34.510 --> 02:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
country that doesn't mean that they did
 

02:51:34.520 --> 02:51:37.469 align:start position:0%
country that doesn't mean that they did

02:51:37.469 --> 02:51:37.479 align:start position:0%
something bad because necessarily
 

02:51:37.479 --> 02:51:38.910 align:start position:0%
something bad because necessarily
because<02:51:37.640><c> it</c><02:51:37.720><c> was</c><02:51:38.000><c> just</c><02:51:38.200><c> at</c><02:51:38.359><c> that</c><02:51:38.520><c> point</c><02:51:38.720><c> in</c>

02:51:38.910 --> 02:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
because it was just at that point in
 

02:51:38.920 --> 02:51:41.469 align:start position:0%
because it was just at that point in
time<02:51:39.279><c> right</c><02:51:39.760><c> that's</c><02:51:39.880><c> what</c><02:51:40.000><c> I'm</c><02:51:40.160><c> thinking</c><02:51:40.880><c> so</c><02:51:41.239><c> I</c>

02:51:41.469 --> 02:51:41.479 align:start position:0%
time right that's what I'm thinking so I
 

02:51:41.479 --> 02:51:43.309 align:start position:0%
time right that's what I'm thinking so I
I<02:51:41.640><c> I</c><02:51:41.720><c> jumped</c><02:51:42.040><c> over</c><02:51:42.279><c> this</c><02:51:42.560><c> graph</c><02:51:42.840><c> so</c><02:51:43.040><c> this</c><02:51:43.160><c> is</c>

02:51:43.309 --> 02:51:43.319 align:start position:0%

dig out a slide from Sweden that shows
 

02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:13.550 align:start position:0%
dig out a slide from Sweden that shows
very<02:54:11.080><c> interesting</c><02:54:11.479><c> with</c><02:54:12.120><c> vaccinations</c><02:54:13.120><c> but</c>

02:54:13.550 --> 02:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
very interesting with vaccinations but
 

02:54:13.560 --> 02:54:16.469 align:start position:0%
very interesting with vaccinations but
the<02:54:13.760><c> key</c><02:54:13.960><c> thing</c><02:54:14.160><c> is</c><02:54:14.359><c> also</c><02:54:14.880><c> that</c><02:54:15.880><c> it's</c><02:54:16.080><c> not</c>

02:54:16.469 --> 02:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
the key thing is also that it's not
 

02:54:16.479 --> 02:54:19.550 align:start position:0%
the key thing is also that it's not
vaccination<02:54:17.200><c> rate</c><02:54:17.600><c> as</c><02:54:17.720><c> a</c><02:54:17.880><c> whole</c><02:54:18.160><c> as</c><02:54:18.560><c> important</c>

02:54:19.550 --> 02:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate as a whole as important
 

02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:21.429 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate as a whole as important
it's<02:54:19.760><c> the</c><02:54:20.000><c> vaccination</c><02:54:20.640><c> among</c><02:54:20.880><c> the</c><02:54:21.000><c> elderly</c>

02:54:21.429 --> 02:54:21.439 align:start position:0%
it's the vaccination among the elderly
 

02:54:21.439 --> 02:54:23.469 align:start position:0%
it's the vaccination among the elderly
that's<02:54:21.680><c> important</c><02:54:22.200><c> that's</c><02:54:22.520><c> the</c><02:54:23.040><c> that's</c><02:54:23.239><c> what</c>

02:54:23.469 --> 02:54:23.479 align:start position:0%
that's important that's the that's what
 

02:54:23.479 --> 02:54:26.750 align:start position:0%
that's important that's the that's what
actually<02:54:23.800><c> affects</c><02:54:24.359><c> the</c><02:54:25.160><c> the</c><02:54:25.560><c> mortality</c><02:54:26.080><c> rates</c>

02:54:26.750 --> 02:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
actually affects the the mortality rates
 

02:54:26.760 --> 02:54:27.990 align:start position:0%
actually affects the the mortality rates
and<02:54:26.920><c> that's</c><02:54:27.279><c> thank</c><02:54:27.439><c> you</c><02:54:27.640><c> because</c><02:54:27.800><c> that's</c><02:54:27.920><c> what</c>

comment well I think that's going to be
 

02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:37.910 align:start position:0%
comment well I think that's going to be
one<02:55:36.080><c> of</c><02:55:36.239><c> the</c><02:55:36.439><c> struggles</c><02:55:36.920><c> for</c><02:55:37.160><c> us</c><02:55:37.479><c> because</c><02:55:37.760><c> we</c>

02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
one of the struggles for us because we
 

02:55:37.920 --> 02:55:40.190 align:start position:0%
one of the struggles for us because we
have<02:55:38.200><c> experts</c><02:55:38.680><c> in</c><02:55:38.960><c> particular</c><02:55:39.640><c> areas</c><02:55:40.080><c> and</c>

02:55:40.190 --> 02:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
have experts in particular areas and
 

02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:41.630 align:start position:0%
have experts in particular areas and
we're<02:55:40.359><c> going</c><02:55:40.439><c> to</c><02:55:40.600><c> have</c><02:55:40.720><c> to</c><02:55:40.920><c> put</c><02:55:41.080><c> it</c><02:55:41.239><c> all</c>

02:55:41.630 --> 02:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to put it all
 

02:55:41.640 --> 02:55:44.309 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to put it all
together<02:55:42.040><c> because</c><02:55:42.200><c> it's</c><02:55:42.640><c> hard</c><02:55:42.880><c> to</c><02:55:43.160><c> view</c><02:55:43.600><c> any</c>

02:55:44.309 --> 02:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
together because it's hard to view any
 

02:55:44.319 --> 02:55:48.429 align:start position:0%
together because it's hard to view any
individual<02:55:45.200><c> thing</c><02:55:46.160><c> in</c><02:55:46.920><c> isolation</c><02:55:47.800><c> this</c><02:55:47.960><c> whole</c>

issue of correlation is not
 

02:55:51.399 --> 02:55:55.110 align:start position:0%
issue of correlation is not

02:56:15.349 --> 02:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
covid by time so you can see that uh
 

02:56:15.359 --> 02:56:19.349 align:start position:0%
covid by time so you can see that uh
there's<02:56:15.760><c> two</c><02:56:16.120><c> peaks</c><02:56:17.120><c> of</c><02:56:17.479><c> Co</c><02:56:17.800><c> circulation</c>

02:56:19.349 --> 02:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
there's two peaks of Co circulation
 

02:56:19.359 --> 02:56:22.349 align:start position:0%
there's two peaks of Co circulation
one<02:56:19.680><c> sort</c><02:56:19.840><c> of</c><02:56:20.080><c> peaked</c><02:56:20.560><c> in</c><02:56:20.880><c> around</c><02:56:21.359><c> December</c>

02:56:22.349 --> 02:56:22.359 align:start position:0%
one sort of peaked in around December
 

02:56:22.359 --> 02:56:24.710 align:start position:0%
one sort of peaked in around December
and<02:56:22.479><c> then</c><02:56:22.600><c> there</c><02:56:22.760><c> was</c><02:56:22.880><c> a</c><02:56:23.040><c> second</c><02:56:23.439><c> Peak</c><02:56:24.000><c> around</c>

02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
and then there was a second Peak around
 

02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:29.790 align:start position:0%
and then there was a second Peak around
April<02:56:25.160><c> May</c><02:56:26.160><c> so</c><02:56:26.439><c> this</c><02:56:26.560><c> is</c><02:56:26.920><c> how</c><02:56:27.680><c> the</c><02:56:28.680><c> this</c><02:56:28.800><c> is</c><02:56:29.040><c> how</c>

02:56:29.790 --> 02:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
April May so this is how the this is how
 

02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:32.389 align:start position:0%
April May so this is how the this is how

02:56:32.389 --> 02:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
the virus was circulating so this is all
 

02:56:32.399 --> 02:56:33.670 align:start position:0%
the virus was circulating so this is all

02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
ages the first red uh vertical line is
 

02:56:38.640 --> 02:56:40.710 align:start position:0%
ages the first red uh vertical line is
the<02:56:38.800><c> start</c><02:56:39.120><c> of</c><02:56:39.239><c> the</c><02:56:39.359><c> vaccination</c>

02:56:40.710 --> 02:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
the start of the vaccination
 

02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:45.030 align:start position:0%
the start of the vaccination
campaign<02:56:41.720><c> so</c><02:56:41.920><c> during</c><02:56:42.399><c> this</c><02:56:43.239><c> uh</c><02:56:43.600><c> first</c><02:56:44.600><c> Peak</c>

02:56:45.030 --> 02:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
campaign so during this uh first Peak
 

02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:47.110 align:start position:0%
campaign so during this uh first Peak
That<02:56:45.439><c> season</c><02:56:46.120><c> this</c><02:56:46.239><c> was</c><02:56:46.399><c> the</c><02:56:46.560><c> second</c><02:56:46.840><c> Peak</c>

02:56:47.110 --> 02:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
That season this was the second Peak
 

02:56:47.120 --> 02:56:49.269 align:start position:0%
That season this was the second Peak
because<02:56:47.319><c> there</c><02:56:47.439><c> was</c><02:56:47.600><c> one</c><02:56:47.840><c> Peak</c><02:56:48.680><c> in</c><02:56:48.840><c> the</c><02:56:49.000><c> spring</c>

02:56:49.269 --> 02:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
because there was one Peak in the spring
 

02:56:49.279 --> 02:56:51.389 align:start position:0%
because there was one Peak in the spring
of<02:56:49.479><c> 2020</c><02:56:50.279><c> then</c><02:56:50.399><c> the</c><02:56:50.520><c> summer</c><02:56:50.880><c> came</c><02:56:51.040><c> and</c><02:56:51.200><c> went</c>

02:56:51.389 --> 02:56:51.399 align:start position:0%
of 2020 then the summer came and went
 

02:56:51.399 --> 02:56:55.150 align:start position:0%
of 2020 then the summer came and went
down<02:56:51.640><c> and</c><02:56:51.800><c> then</c><02:56:52.560><c> so</c><02:56:52.840><c> during</c><02:56:53.200><c> that</c><02:56:53.760><c> Peak</c><02:56:54.760><c> uh</c><02:56:55.000><c> the</c>

02:56:55.150 --> 02:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
down and then so during that Peak uh the
 

02:56:55.160 --> 02:56:56.990 align:start position:0%
down and then so during that Peak uh the
vaccination<02:56:55.720><c> only</c><02:56:55.960><c> started</c><02:56:56.399><c> at</c><02:56:56.600><c> sort</c><02:56:56.800><c> of</c><02:56:56.920><c> at</c>

02:56:56.990 --> 02:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination only started at sort of at
 

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:58.990 align:start position:0%
vaccination only started at sort of at
the<02:56:57.080><c> end</c><02:56:57.279><c> of</c><02:56:57.399><c> it</c><02:56:57.760><c> and</c><02:56:57.840><c> it</c><02:56:58.000><c> takes</c><02:56:58.239><c> some</c><02:56:58.640><c> time</c><02:56:58.800><c> for</c>

uh thank you so there could be some
misdiagnosis<03:08:10.560><c> I</c><03:08:10.640><c> don't</c><03:08:10.800><c> think</c><03:08:11.000><c> that's</c><03:08:11.239><c> the</c>

03:08:11.469 --> 03:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
misdiagnosis I don't think that's the
 

03:08:11.479 --> 03:08:14.349 align:start position:0%
misdiagnosis I don't think that's the
main<03:08:11.800><c> reason</c><03:08:12.319><c> I</c><03:08:12.439><c> think</c><03:08:12.880><c> what</c><03:08:13.040><c> you</c><03:08:13.200><c> allude</c><03:08:13.520><c> to</c>

03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
main reason I think what you allude to
 

03:08:14.359 --> 03:08:18.550 align:start position:0%
main reason I think what you allude to
instead<03:08:15.359><c> is</c><03:08:15.840><c> that</c><03:08:16.520><c> uh</c>

03:08:18.550 --> 03:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
instead is that uh
 

03:08:18.560 --> 03:08:20.910 align:start position:0%
instead is that uh
well<03:08:18.680><c> I</c><03:08:18.760><c> will</c><03:08:18.920><c> say</c><03:08:19.120><c> there's</c><03:08:19.600><c> two</c><03:08:19.840><c> things</c><03:08:20.640><c> one</c>

03:08:20.910 --> 03:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
well I will say there's two things one
 

03:08:20.920 --> 03:08:25.469 align:start position:0%
well I will say there's two things one
is<03:08:21.359><c> that</c><03:08:22.359><c> the</c><03:08:22.920><c> lockdowns</c><03:08:23.920><c> did</c><03:08:24.239><c> affect</c><03:08:24.720><c> other</c>

03:08:25.469 --> 03:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
is that the lockdowns did affect other
 

03:08:25.479 --> 03:08:27.870 align:start position:0%
is that the lockdowns did affect other
viruses<03:08:26.479><c> so</c><03:08:26.680><c> there</c><03:08:26.800><c> were</c><03:08:27.040><c> less</c>

03:08:27.870 --> 03:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
viruses so there were less
 

03:08:27.880 --> 03:08:31.269 align:start position:0%
viruses so there were less
circulations<03:08:28.880><c> of</c><03:08:29.479><c> of</c><03:08:29.960><c> uh</c><03:08:30.160><c> other</c><03:08:30.439><c> viruses</c><03:08:30.920><c> and</c>

03:08:31.269 --> 03:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
circulations of of uh other viruses and
 

03:08:31.279 --> 03:08:33.950 align:start position:0%
circulations of of uh other viruses and
I<03:08:31.359><c> think</c><03:08:31.520><c> including</c><03:08:31.880><c> flu</c><03:08:32.279><c> but</c><03:08:32.479><c> also</c><03:08:33.200><c> RSV</c><03:08:33.800><c> for</c>

03:08:33.950 --> 03:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
I think including flu but also RSV for
 

03:08:33.960 --> 03:08:35.990 align:start position:0%
I think including flu but also RSV for
example<03:08:34.279><c> so</c><03:08:34.479><c> some</c><03:08:34.600><c> of</c><03:08:34.720><c> the</c><03:08:34.840><c> childhood</c>

03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
example so some of the childhood
 

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:38.150 align:start position:0%
example so some of the childhood
diseases<03:08:37.000><c> uh</c><03:08:37.279><c> you</c><03:08:37.399><c> would</c><03:08:37.640><c> think</c><03:08:37.840><c> that</c><03:08:38.000><c> that's</c>

03:08:38.150 --> 03:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
diseases uh you would think that that's
 

03:08:38.160 --> 03:08:39.190 align:start position:0%
diseases uh you would think that that's
a<03:08:38.359><c> good</c>

03:08:39.190 --> 03:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
a good
 

03:08:39.200 --> 03:08:41.870 align:start position:0%
a good
thing<03:08:40.200><c> and</c><03:08:40.359><c> to</c><03:08:40.560><c> some</c><03:08:40.760><c> extent</c><03:08:41.080><c> it</c><03:08:41.239><c> is</c><03:08:41.600><c> but</c><03:08:41.720><c> it</c>

03:08:41.870 --> 03:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
thing and to some extent it is but it
 

03:08:41.880 --> 03:08:44.269 align:start position:0%
thing and to some extent it is but it
also<03:08:42.080><c> is</c><03:08:42.200><c> to</c><03:08:42.359><c> some</c><03:08:42.560><c> extent</c><03:08:42.800><c> the</c><03:08:43.000><c> bad</c><03:08:43.279><c> things</c>

03:08:44.269 --> 03:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
also is to some extent the bad things
 

03:08:44.279 --> 03:08:45.870 align:start position:0%
also is to some extent the bad things
because<03:08:44.560><c> what</c><03:08:44.720><c> happened</c><03:08:45.080><c> was</c><03:08:45.319><c> then</c><03:08:45.479><c> you</c><03:08:45.600><c> don't</c>

03:08:45.870 --> 03:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
because what happened was then you don't
 

03:08:45.880 --> 03:08:48.790 align:start position:0%

03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%

flu<03:10:38.120><c> wouldn't</c><03:10:38.399><c> sort</c><03:10:38.600><c> of</c><03:10:39.239><c> come</c><03:10:39.399><c> out</c><03:10:39.600><c> and</c><03:10:39.760><c> now</c><03:10:40.080><c> of</c>

03:10:40.190 --> 03:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
flu wouldn't sort of come out and now of
 

03:10:40.200 --> 03:10:42.950 align:start position:0%
flu wouldn't sort of come out and now of
course<03:10:40.359><c> flu</c><03:10:40.640><c> is</c><03:10:40.800><c> back</c><03:10:41.120><c> because</c><03:10:41.840><c> Co</c><03:10:42.160><c> is</c><03:10:42.359><c> down</c>

03:10:42.950 --> 03:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
course flu is back because Co is down
 

03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:44.830 align:start position:0%
course flu is back because Co is down

03:10:52.600 --> 03:10:53.670 align:start position:0%
question so at one point in time and I
can't<03:10:52.840><c> remember</c><03:10:53.279><c> because</c><03:10:53.399><c> I've</c><03:10:53.520><c> been</c>

there<03:10:56.760><c> was</c><03:10:57.439><c> a</c><03:10:58.239><c> a</c><03:10:58.399><c> point</c><03:10:58.600><c> in</c><03:10:58.800><c> time</c><03:10:59.160><c> for</c><03:10:59.319><c> example</c>

03:10:59.630 --> 03:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
there was a a point in time for example
 

03:10:59.640 --> 03:11:02.110 align:start position:0%
there was a a point in time for example
in<03:10:59.760><c> our</c><03:10:59.960><c> country</c><03:11:00.920><c> that</c><03:11:01.080><c> the</c><03:11:01.160><c> CDC</c><03:11:01.680><c> wasn't</c><03:11:01.920><c> even</c>

03:11:33.630 --> 03:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
kind of same thing was was what you were
 

03:11:33.640 --> 03:11:36.870 align:start position:0%
kind of same thing was was what you were

03:11:36.870 --> 03:11:36.880 align:start position:0%

03:11:36.880 --> 03:11:39.590 align:start position:0%
seeing um outside of like the
CDC<03:11:37.880><c> so</c><03:11:38.080><c> I</c><03:11:38.160><c> don't</c><03:11:38.319><c> think</c><03:11:38.520><c> that</c><03:11:38.760><c> explains</c><03:11:39.439><c> that</c>

03:11:39.590 --> 03:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
CDC so I don't think that explains that
 

03:11:39.600 --> 03:11:42.550 align:start position:0%
CDC so I don't think that explains that
we<03:11:39.760><c> don't</c><03:11:40.560><c> have</c><03:11:41.160><c> had</c><03:11:41.520><c> the</c><03:11:41.880><c> I</c><03:11:41.960><c> think</c><03:11:42.120><c> we</c><03:11:42.239><c> truly</c>

didn't have much flu for a while uh
 

03:11:45.920 --> 03:11:47.790 align:start position:0%
didn't have much flu for a while uh

03:11:49.670 --> 03:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
in other countries also so I think we
 

03:11:49.680 --> 03:11:54.510 align:start position:0%
in other countries also so I think we
truly<03:11:50.040><c> didn't</c><03:11:50.279><c> have</c><03:11:50.439><c> flu</c><03:11:51.239><c> for</c><03:11:51.479><c> for</c><03:11:51.600><c> a</c><03:11:52.080><c> while</c><03:11:53.239><c> um</c>

surveys CDC didn't do that until I think
 

03:12:40.439 --> 03:12:42.910 align:start position:0%
surveys CDC didn't do that until I think
two<03:12:40.600><c> or</c><03:12:40.720><c> three</c><03:12:40.920><c> years</c><03:12:41.080><c> into</c><03:12:41.319><c> the</c><03:12:41.720><c> pandemic</c><03:12:42.720><c> so</c>

03:12:42.910 --> 03:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
two or three years into the pandemic so
 

03:12:42.920 --> 03:12:44.750 align:start position:0%
two or three years into the pandemic so
we<03:12:43.040><c> were</c><03:12:43.160><c> sort</c><03:12:43.319><c> of</c><03:12:43.479><c> stuck</c><03:12:43.840><c> with</c><03:12:44.040><c> having</c><03:12:44.600><c> there</c>

03:12:44.750 --> 03:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
we were sort of stuck with having there
 

03:12:44.760 --> 03:12:46.670 align:start position:0%
we were sort of stuck with having there
was<03:12:45.000><c> one</c><03:12:45.279><c> done</c><03:12:45.479><c> in</c><03:12:45.680><c> Santa</c><03:12:46.000><c> Clara</c><03:12:46.319><c> County</c><03:12:46.600><c> I</c>

03:12:46.670 --> 03:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
was one done in Santa Clara County I
 

03:12:46.680 --> 03:12:49.229 align:start position:0%
was one done in Santa Clara County I
think<03:12:46.800><c> that</c><03:12:46.880><c> was</c><03:12:47.000><c> the</c><03:12:47.239><c> first</c><03:12:47.880><c> one</c><03:12:48.880><c> uh</c><03:12:49.080><c> but</c>

03:12:49.229 --> 03:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
think that was the first one uh but
 

03:12:49.239 --> 03:12:52.229 align:start position:0%
think that was the first one uh but
that's<03:12:49.439><c> one</c><03:12:49.720><c> County</c><03:12:50.600><c> in</c><03:12:50.800><c> one</c><03:12:51.080><c> state</c><03:12:51.960><c> and</c><03:12:52.080><c> so</c>

03:12:52.229 --> 03:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
that's one County in one state and so
 

03:12:52.239 --> 03:12:54.030 align:start position:0%
that's one County in one state and so
that<03:12:52.359><c> was</c><03:12:52.560><c> very</c><03:12:52.800><c> valuable</c><03:12:53.279><c> information</c><03:12:53.880><c> but</c>

03:12:54.030 --> 03:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
that was very valuable information but
 

03:12:54.040 --> 03:12:55.550 align:start position:0%
that was very valuable information but
we<03:12:54.160><c> should</c><03:12:54.319><c> have</c><03:12:54.439><c> had</c><03:12:54.600><c> that</c><03:12:54.760><c> Nationwide</c><03:12:55.439><c> there</c>

03:12:55.550 --> 03:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
we should have had that Nationwide there
 

03:12:55.560 --> 03:12:57.950 align:start position:0%
we should have had that Nationwide there
was<03:12:55.680><c> one</c><03:12:55.840><c> in</c><03:12:55.960><c> Southern</c><03:12:56.680><c> California</c><03:12:57.680><c> there</c><03:12:57.800><c> was</c>

03:12:57.950 --> 03:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
was one in Southern California there was
 

03:12:57.960 --> 03:13:00.710 align:start position:0%
was one in Southern California there was
one<03:12:58.120><c> I</c><03:12:58.239><c> think</c><03:12:58.359><c> in</c><03:12:58.520><c> Idaho</c><03:12:59.479><c> very</c><03:12:59.720><c> small</c><03:13:00.000><c> one</c><03:13:00.560><c> so</c>

03:13:00.710 --> 03:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
one I think in Idaho very small one so
 

03:13:00.720 --> 03:13:02.229 align:start position:0%
one I think in Idaho very small one so
there<03:13:00.840><c> was</c><03:13:01.000><c> all</c><03:13:01.200><c> the</c><03:13:01.399><c> spotted</c><03:13:01.800><c> things</c><03:13:02.040><c> that</c>

03:27:39.309 --> 03:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
on the presentation is that the lockdown
 

03:27:39.319 --> 03:27:41.269 align:start position:0%
on the presentation is that the lockdown

03:27:41.279 --> 03:27:44.309 align:start position:0%
without looking at any other measures
seems<03:27:41.640><c> to</c><03:27:41.800><c> have</c><03:27:41.920><c> done</c><03:27:42.160><c> more</c><03:27:42.399><c> harm</c><03:27:42.720><c> than</c><03:27:43.319><c> good</c>

03:27:44.309 --> 03:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
seems to have done more harm than good
 

03:27:44.319 --> 03:27:46.229 align:start position:0%
seems to have done more harm than good
but<03:27:44.479><c> then</c><03:27:44.720><c> can</c><03:27:44.840><c> we</c><03:27:45.040><c> also</c><03:27:45.319><c> take</c><03:27:45.520><c> for</c><03:27:45.680><c> instance</c>

03:27:46.229 --> 03:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
but then can we also take for instance

but then can we also take for instance
let's<03:27:46.439><c> say</c><03:27:46.920><c> um</c><03:27:47.160><c> we</c><03:27:47.279><c> can</c><03:27:47.439><c> take</c><03:27:47.640><c> the</c><03:27:47.760><c> average</c>

03:27:48.070 --> 03:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
let's say um we can take the average
 

03:27:48.080 --> 03:27:49.830 align:start position:0%
let's say um we can take the average

does not need protection and in the
 

03:32:24.080 --> 03:32:27.990 align:start position:0%
does not need protection and in the

03:32:27.990 --> 03:32:28.000 align:start position:0%

03:32:28.000 --> 03:32:32.030 align:start position:0%
beginning you showed Wuhan mortality
data<03:32:28.479><c> by</c><03:32:28.760><c> age</c><03:32:29.160><c> and</c><03:32:29.399><c> then</c><03:32:29.640><c> some</c><03:32:29.880><c> us</c><03:32:30.439><c> data</c><03:32:31.319><c> by</c><03:32:31.560><c> age</c>

03:32:32.030 --> 03:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
data by age and then some us data by age
 

03:32:32.040 --> 03:32:37.070 align:start position:0%
data by age and then some us data by age
so<03:32:33.520><c> basically</c><03:32:34.520><c> could</c><03:32:34.720><c> you</c><03:32:35.000><c> qualify</c><03:32:35.840><c> that</c><03:32:36.319><c> data</c>

03:32:37.070 --> 03:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
so basically could you qualify that data
 

03:32:37.080 --> 03:32:40.910 align:start position:0%
so basically could you qualify that data
in<03:32:37.439><c> relation</c><03:32:38.439><c> of</c><03:32:38.720><c> risk</c><03:32:39.160><c> for</c><03:32:39.520><c> kids</c><03:32:40.160><c> and</c><03:32:40.560><c> also</c>

in relation of risk for kids and also
 

03:32:40.920 --> 03:32:45.349 align:start position:0%
in relation of risk for kids and also
like<03:32:41.880><c> uh</c><03:32:42.080><c> put</c><03:32:42.279><c> some</c><03:32:42.600><c> time</c><03:32:43.040><c> stamp</c><03:32:43.560><c> so</c><03:32:44.279><c> when</c><03:32:44.800><c> when</c>

03:32:45.349 --> 03:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
like uh put some time stamp so when when
 

03:32:45.359 --> 03:32:48.389 align:start position:0%
like uh put some time stamp so when when
so<03:32:45.920><c> it</c><03:32:46.040><c> looks</c><03:32:46.319><c> like</c><03:32:46.680><c> from</c><03:32:46.960><c> the</c><03:32:47.439><c> very</c><03:32:47.800><c> very</c><03:32:48.120><c> very</c>

talked about natural immunity a little
 

03:35:37.520 --> 03:35:43.030 align:start position:0%
talked about natural immunity a little
bit<03:35:38.279><c> so</c><03:35:38.840><c> is</c><03:35:39.399><c> if</c><03:35:39.680><c> an</c><03:35:40.120><c> a</c><03:35:40.560><c> child</c><03:35:41.199><c> or</c><03:35:41.680><c> a</c><03:35:41.880><c> young</c><03:35:42.120><c> adult</c>

03:35:46.110 --> 03:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
got covid is that more beneficial uh for
 

03:35:46.120 --> 03:35:47.670 align:start position:0%

they're older and this is and say
something<03:35:49.800><c> else</c><03:35:50.120><c> happens</c><03:35:50.600><c> that</c><03:35:50.920><c> this</c><03:35:51.080><c> would</c>

03:35:51.830 --> 03:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
something else happens that this would
 

03:35:51.840 --> 03:35:54.389 align:start position:0%
something else happens that this would
help<03:35:52.160><c> them</c><03:35:52.760><c> their</c><03:35:52.920><c> immune</c>

03:35:54.389 --> 03:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
help them their immune
 

03:35:54.399 --> 03:35:58.110 align:start position:0%
help them their immune
system<03:35:55.399><c> so</c><03:35:55.680><c> I</c><03:35:55.760><c> don't</c><03:35:55.960><c> know</c><03:35:56.399><c> if</c>

03:36:06.600 --> 03:36:08.910 align:start position:0%

03:36:08.920 --> 03:36:10.710 align:start position:0%
know is that the risks from the from

03:36:10.710 --> 03:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
having it the first time is much lower
 

03:36:10.720 --> 03:36:14.229 align:start position:0%
having it the first time is much lower
as<03:36:10.840><c> a</c><03:36:11.319><c> child</c><03:36:12.319><c> than</c><03:36:12.840><c> even</c><03:36:13.359><c> so</c><03:36:13.600><c> the</c><03:36:13.840><c> risk</c><03:36:14.080><c> is</c>

03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
as a child than even so the risk is
 

03:36:14.239 --> 03:36:16.150 align:start position:0%
as a child than even so the risk is
lower<03:36:14.520><c> if</c><03:36:14.640><c> you</c><03:36:14.760><c> are</c><03:36:14.880><c> 10</c><03:36:15.080><c> years</c><03:36:15.319><c> than</c><03:36:15.600><c> if</c><03:36:15.720><c> you</c>

03:36:16.150 --> 03:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
lower if you are 10 years than if you
 

03:36:16.160 --> 03:36:20.349 align:start position:0%
lower if you are 10 years than if you
are<03:36:17.160><c> 50</c><03:36:18.000><c> but</c><03:36:18.120><c> it's</c><03:36:18.279><c> lower</c><03:36:18.560><c> than</c><03:36:18.800><c> 50</c><03:36:19.160><c> than</c><03:36:19.399><c> 60</c><03:36:20.239><c> I</c>

03:36:20.349 --> 03:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
are 50 but it's lower than 50 than 60 I
 

03:36:20.359 --> 03:36:22.710 align:start position:0%
are 50 but it's lower than 50 than 60 I
think<03:36:20.720><c> the</c><03:36:21.199><c> the</c><03:36:21.359><c> risk</c><03:36:21.640><c> of</c><03:36:21.800><c> mortality</c><03:36:22.319><c> doubles</c>

03:36:22.710 --> 03:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
think the the risk of mortality doubles
 

03:36:22.720 --> 03:36:25.469 align:start position:0%
think the the risk of mortality doubles
around<03:36:23.000><c> every</c><03:36:23.479><c> of</c><03:36:23.880><c> every</c><03:36:24.120><c> seven</c><03:36:24.399><c> years</c><03:36:24.600><c> of</c><03:36:24.800><c> age</c>

around every of every seven years of age
 

03:36:25.479 --> 03:36:28.269 align:start position:0%
around every of every seven years of age

03:36:28.269 --> 03:36:28.279 align:start position:0%
so it's a very rapid thing now I would
 

03:36:28.279 --> 03:36:30.670 align:start position:0%
so it's a very rapid thing now I would
say<03:36:28.520><c> also</c><03:36:28.800><c> that</c><03:36:29.000><c> this</c><03:36:29.160><c> is</c><03:36:29.319><c> for</c>

03:36:30.670 --> 03:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
say also that this is for
 

03:36:30.680 --> 03:36:33.229 align:start position:0%
say also that this is for

like we have to be equal with everybody
 

03:39:57.040 --> 03:39:58.910 align:start position:0%
like we have to be equal with everybody
but<03:39:57.399><c> that</c><03:39:57.600><c> does</c><03:39:57.760><c> a</c><03:39:57.960><c> disservice</c><03:39:58.479><c> to</c><03:39:58.640><c> those</c><03:39:58.800><c> who</c>

03:40:02.710 --> 03:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
are higher risk so um uh eventually I
 

03:40:02.720 --> 03:40:05.070 align:start position:0%
are higher risk so um uh eventually I
think<03:40:02.840><c> it</c><03:40:03.040><c> came</c><03:40:03.199><c> to</c><03:40:03.439><c> that</c><03:40:04.239><c> but</c><03:40:04.399><c> for</c><03:40:04.560><c> a</c><03:40:04.720><c> while</c><03:40:04.960><c> it</c>

03:40:05.070 --> 03:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
think it came to that but for a while it
 

03:40:05.080 --> 03:40:06.590 align:start position:0%
think it came to that but for a while it

again<03:40:10.520><c> we</c><03:40:10.680><c> find</c><03:40:11.000><c> the</c><03:40:11.720><c> population</c><03:40:12.199><c> at</c><03:40:12.359><c> highest</c>

us and I got a room full of kids that
 

04:29:02.479 --> 04:29:04.269 align:start position:0%
us and I got a room full of kids that
now<04:29:02.880><c> the</c><04:29:03.040><c> standard</c><04:29:03.359><c> deviation</c><04:29:03.760><c> of</c><04:29:03.880><c> learning</c>

04:29:04.269 --> 04:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
now the standard deviation of learning
 

04:29:04.279 --> 04:29:07.469 align:start position:0%
now the standard deviation of learning
is<04:29:04.600><c> is</c><04:29:04.840><c> far</c><04:29:05.479><c> greater</c><04:29:06.479><c> um</c><04:29:06.640><c> on</c><04:29:06.840><c> July</c><04:29:07.159><c> 10th</c>

04:29:07.469 --> 04:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
is is far greater um on July 10th
 

04:29:07.479 --> 04:29:09.229 align:start position:0%
is is far greater um on July 10th
setting<04:29:07.800><c> realistic</c><04:29:08.439><c> expectations</c><04:29:09.080><c> for</c>

04:29:12.590 --> 04:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
school reopening um and so again we had
 

04:29:12.600 --> 04:29:14.950 align:start position:0%
school reopening um and so again we had
collected<04:29:13.520><c> uh</c><04:29:13.880><c> you</c><04:29:14.040><c> know</c><04:29:14.359><c> um</c><04:29:14.520><c> throughout</c><04:29:14.840><c> the</c>

collected uh you know um throughout the
 

04:29:14.960 --> 04:29:17.109 align:start position:0%
collected uh you know um throughout the

04:29:17.109 --> 04:29:17.119 align:start position:0%
summer we had our start thing we
 

04:29:17.119 --> 04:29:20.830 align:start position:0%
summer we had our start thing we
collected<04:29:17.520><c> 56,000</c><04:29:18.920><c> responses</c><04:29:19.920><c> and</c><04:29:20.399><c> the</c><04:29:20.520><c> tone</c>

04:29:20.830 --> 04:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
collected 56,000 responses and the tone
 

04:29:20.840 --> 04:29:23.630 align:start position:0%
collected 56,000 responses and the tone
here<04:29:21.000><c> so</c><04:29:21.199><c> again</c><04:29:21.520><c> the</c><04:29:21.920><c> the</c><04:29:22.800><c> the</c><04:29:22.960><c> title</c><04:29:23.399><c> might</c>

here so again the the the title might
 

04:29:23.640 --> 04:29:26.149 align:start position:0%
here so again the the the title might

bury the lead really where it
 

04:29:26.159 --> 04:29:28.790 align:start position:0%
bury the lead really where it
says<04:29:27.159><c> uh</c><04:29:27.279><c> setting</c><04:29:27.640><c> realistic</c><04:29:28.279><c> expectations</c>

04:29:28.790 --> 04:29:28.800 align:start position:0%

bit<04:48:10.120><c> little</c><04:48:10.360><c> complicated</c><04:48:10.840><c> let</c><04:48:10.920><c> me</c><04:48:11.080><c> set</c><04:48:11.240><c> the</c>

04:48:11.310 --> 04:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
bit little complicated let me set the
 

04:48:11.320 --> 04:48:13.510 align:start position:0%
bit little complicated let me set the
stage<04:48:11.600><c> so</c><04:48:12.200><c> I</c><04:48:12.280><c> think</c><04:48:12.440><c> one</c><04:48:12.520><c> of</c><04:48:12.638><c> the</c><04:48:12.718><c> things</c><04:48:13.400><c> that</c>

04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
stage so I think one of the things that
 

04:48:13.520 --> 04:48:15.190 align:start position:0%
stage so I think one of the things that
I<04:48:13.638><c> hear</c><04:48:13.840><c> most</c><04:48:14.080><c> about</c><04:48:14.280><c> that</c><04:48:14.440><c> people</c><04:48:14.638><c> are</c><04:48:14.798><c> not</c>

04:48:15.190 --> 04:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
I hear most about that people are not
 

04:48:15.200 --> 04:48:17.110 align:start position:0%
I hear most about that people are not
terribly<04:48:15.638><c> happy</c><04:48:15.920><c> with</c><04:48:16.080><c> that</c><04:48:16.320><c> happened</c><04:48:16.680><c> during</c>

04:48:17.110 --> 04:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
terribly happy with that happened during
 

04:48:17.120 --> 04:48:20.390 align:start position:0%
terribly happy with that happened during
Co<04:48:17.440><c> time</c><04:48:17.718><c> is</c><04:48:18.280><c> is</c><04:48:18.480><c> how</c><04:48:18.760><c> long</c><04:48:19.558><c> schools</c><04:48:20.040><c> had</c>

04:48:20.390 --> 04:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
Co time is is how long schools had
 

04:48:20.400 --> 04:48:22.628 align:start position:0%
Co time is is how long schools had
remained<04:48:20.718><c> closed</c><04:48:21.480><c> and</c><04:48:21.840><c> the</c><04:48:21.958><c> learning</c><04:48:22.320><c> loss</c>

04:48:22.628 --> 04:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
remained closed and the learning loss
 

04:48:22.638 --> 04:48:24.510 align:start position:0%
remained closed and the learning loss
and<04:48:22.798><c> other</c><04:48:23.080><c> issues</c><04:48:23.360><c> that</c><04:48:23.520><c> occurred</c><04:48:23.840><c> with</c>

04:48:24.510 --> 04:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
and other issues that occurred with
 

04:48:24.520 --> 04:48:26.350 align:start position:0%
and other issues that occurred with
students<04:48:25.520><c> and</c><04:48:25.638><c> I</c><04:48:25.760><c> think</c><04:48:25.920><c> part</c><04:48:26.040><c> of</c><04:48:26.160><c> our</c>

04:48:26.350 --> 04:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
students and I think part of our
 

04:48:26.360 --> 04:48:27.910 align:start position:0%
students and I think part of our
responsibility<04:48:27.000><c> here</c><04:48:27.080><c> in</c><04:48:27.200><c> this</c><04:48:27.320><c> committee</c><04:48:27.638><c> is</c>

04:48:27.910 --> 04:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility here in this committee is
 

04:48:27.920 --> 04:48:30.310 align:start position:0%
responsibility here in this committee is
really<04:48:28.160><c> trying</c><04:48:28.440><c> to</c><04:48:28.958><c> untangle</c><04:48:29.638><c> this</c><04:48:29.840><c> knot</c><04:48:30.240><c> a</c>

04:48:30.310 --> 04:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
really trying to untangle this knot a
 

04:48:30.320 --> 04:48:31.470 align:start position:0%
really trying to untangle this knot a
little<04:48:30.520><c> bit</c><04:48:30.718><c> because</c><04:48:30.958><c> this</c><04:48:31.080><c> is</c><04:48:31.200><c> really</c>

04:48:31.470 --> 04:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
little bit because this is really
 

04:48:31.480 --> 04:48:32.948 align:start position:0%
little bit because this is really
complicated<04:48:31.958><c> it's</c><04:48:32.120><c> not</c><04:48:32.360><c> for</c><04:48:32.520><c> the</c><04:48:32.600><c> most</c><04:48:32.798><c> part</c>

04:48:32.948 --> 04:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
complicated it's not for the most part
 

04:48:32.958 --> 04:48:34.310 align:start position:0%
complicated it's not for the most part
it's<04:48:33.080><c> not</c><04:48:33.240><c> as</c><04:48:33.360><c> though</c><04:48:33.480><c> you</c><04:48:33.638><c> have</c><04:48:33.760><c> a</c><04:48:33.920><c> single</c>

04:48:34.310 --> 04:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's not as though you have a single
 

04:48:34.320 --> 04:48:37.350 align:start position:0%
it's not as though you have a single
person<04:48:35.200><c> making</c><04:48:35.600><c> all</c><04:48:35.798><c> these</c><04:48:36.200><c> decisions</c><04:48:37.200><c> so</c>

person making all these decisions so
 

04:48:37.360 --> 04:48:38.708 align:start position:0%
person making all these decisions so
we're<04:48:37.520><c> trying</c><04:48:37.718><c> to</c><04:48:37.798><c> figure</c><04:48:38.040><c> out</c><04:48:38.360><c> where</c>

04:48:38.708 --> 04:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out where
 

04:48:38.718 --> 04:48:41.350 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out where

04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
different things were coming from and I
 

04:48:41.360 --> 04:48:43.230 align:start position:0%
different things were coming from and I
can<04:48:41.520><c> look</c><04:48:41.760><c> right</c><04:48:41.958><c> here</c><04:48:42.280><c> at</c><04:48:42.520><c> even</c><04:48:42.840><c> all</c><04:48:42.958><c> the</c><04:48:43.040><c> way</c>

04:49:06.788 --> 04:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
of where some of this guidance may have
 

04:49:06.798 --> 04:49:09.708 align:start position:0%
of where some of this guidance may have
been<04:49:07.240><c> coming</c><04:49:07.718><c> from</c><04:49:08.480><c> for</c><04:49:08.718><c> as</c><04:49:08.878><c> far</c>

04:49:09.708 --> 04:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
been coming from for as far
 

04:49:09.718 --> 04:49:12.390 align:start position:0%
been coming from for as far
as<04:49:10.798><c> because</c><04:49:11.000><c> again</c><04:49:11.480><c> it</c><04:49:12.000><c> not</c><04:49:12.160><c> all</c><04:49:12.280><c> the</c>

04:49:12.390 --> 04:49:12.400 align:start position:0%

04:49:15.868 --> 04:49:15.878 align:start position:0%
governor a lot of this was even handled
 

04:49:15.878 --> 04:49:20.270 align:start position:0%
governor a lot of this was even handled
locally<04:49:16.878><c> so</c><04:49:17.878><c> where</c><04:49:18.080><c> were</c><04:49:18.400><c> some</c><04:49:18.520><c> of</c><04:49:18.958><c> these</c><04:49:19.958><c> um</c>

04:50:36.040 --> 04:50:37.230 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know if it was I I
believe<04:50:36.240><c> there</c><04:50:36.360><c> was</c><04:50:36.480><c> like</c><04:50:36.600><c> an</c><04:50:36.798><c> American</c>

04:50:37.230 --> 04:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
believe there was like an American
 

04:50:37.240 --> 04:50:39.390 align:start position:0%
believe there was like an American
Academy<04:50:37.558><c> of</c><04:50:37.760><c> Pediatrics</c><04:50:38.760><c> article</c><04:50:39.120><c> that</c><04:50:39.200><c> said</c>

04:50:39.390 --> 04:50:39.400 align:start position:0%

three<04:50:39.600><c> feet</c><04:50:39.840><c> is</c><04:50:39.958><c> a</c><04:50:40.080><c> good</c><04:50:40.200><c> number</c><04:50:40.520><c> right</c><04:50:40.718><c> right</c>

04:50:41.390 --> 04:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
three feet is a good number right right
 

04:50:41.400 --> 04:50:43.230 align:start position:0%
three feet is a good number right right
and<04:50:41.480><c> so</c><04:50:41.638><c> I</c><04:50:41.760><c> believe</c><04:50:42.040><c> our</c><04:50:42.200><c> school</c><04:50:42.680><c> reopening</c>

04:50:43.230 --> 04:50:43.240 align:start position:0%
and so I believe our school reopening
 

04:50:43.240 --> 04:50:46.510 align:start position:0%
and so I believe our school reopening
guidance<04:50:43.680><c> said</c><04:50:43.958><c> 3</c><04:50:44.240><c> feet</c><04:50:44.480><c> is</c><04:50:44.600><c> a</c><04:50:44.760><c> good</c><04:50:45.080><c> number</c><04:50:46.080><c> um</c>

04:50:46.510 --> 04:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
guidance said 3 feet is a good number um
 

04:50:46.520 --> 04:50:48.350 align:start position:0%
guidance said 3 feet is a good number um
and<04:50:46.680><c> I</c><04:50:46.798><c> so</c><04:50:46.958><c> I</c><04:50:47.040><c> would</c><04:50:47.240><c> say</c><04:50:47.600><c> like</c><04:50:47.760><c> that</c><04:50:47.878><c> was</c><04:50:48.040><c> a</c><04:50:48.320><c> I</c>

04:50:48.350 --> 04:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
and I so I would say like that was a I
 

04:50:48.360 --> 04:50:51.030 align:start position:0%
and I so I would say like that was a I
think<04:50:48.600><c> maybe</c><04:50:48.878><c> the</c><04:50:49.120><c> first</c><04:50:50.080><c> that</c><04:50:50.280><c> I</c><04:50:50.480><c> was</c><04:50:50.798><c> that</c><04:50:50.920><c> I</c>

04:50:51.030 --> 04:50:51.040 align:start position:0%

04:56:36.270 --> 04:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
in place on March 12th of 2020 that
 

04:56:36.280 --> 04:56:38.310 align:start position:0%
in place on March 12th of 2020 that
enabled<04:56:36.798><c> them</c><04:56:36.958><c> to</c><04:56:37.120><c> do</c><04:56:37.320><c> that</c><04:56:37.558><c> because</c><04:56:37.798><c> prior</c><04:56:38.120><c> to</c>

04:56:38.310 --> 04:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
enabled them to do that because prior to
 

04:56:38.320 --> 04:56:40.070 align:start position:0%
enabled them to do that because prior to
this<04:56:38.480><c> they</c><04:56:38.600><c> would</c><04:56:38.798><c> not</c><04:56:39.000><c> have</c><04:56:39.160><c> been</c><04:56:39.360><c> able</c><04:56:39.760><c> to</c><04:56:39.920><c> do</c>

04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
this they would not have been able to do
 

04:56:40.080 --> 04:56:41.390 align:start position:0%
this they would not have been able to do
that<04:56:40.280><c> that</c><04:56:40.440><c> right</c><04:56:40.558><c> so</c><04:56:40.638><c> we</c><04:56:40.760><c> enabled</c><04:56:41.240><c> them</c>

04:56:41.390 --> 04:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
that that right so we enabled them
 

04:56:41.400 --> 04:56:43.430 align:start position:0%
that that right so we enabled them
through<04:56:41.600><c> that</c><04:56:41.718><c> remote</c><04:56:42.040><c> instruction</c><04:56:42.480><c> rule</c><04:56:43.200><c> to</c>

through that remote instruction rule to

04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
be a and then to be able to do that and
 

04:56:45.920 --> 04:56:47.548 align:start position:0%
be a and then to be able to do that and
then<04:56:46.040><c> we</c><04:56:46.240><c> provided</c><04:56:46.558><c> them</c><04:56:46.840><c> guidance</c><04:56:47.160><c> for</c><04:56:47.360><c> how</c>

04:56:47.548 --> 04:56:47.558 align:start position:0%
then we provided them guidance for how
 

04:56:47.558 --> 04:56:49.788 align:start position:0%
then we provided them guidance for how
they<04:56:47.718><c> could</c><04:56:48.600><c> uh</c><04:56:48.718><c> if</c><04:56:48.840><c> they</c><04:56:48.920><c> were</c><04:56:49.080><c> doing</c><04:56:49.360><c> that</c><04:56:49.600><c> or</c>

04:56:49.788 --> 04:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
they could uh if they were doing that or
 

04:56:49.798 --> 04:56:51.230 align:start position:0%
they could uh if they were doing that or
if<04:56:49.920><c> they</c><04:56:50.000><c> were</c><04:56:50.200><c> doing</c><04:56:50.480><c> inperson</c><04:56:50.878><c> instruction</c>

04:56:51.230 --> 04:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
if they were doing inperson instruction
 

04:56:51.240 --> 04:56:53.270 align:start position:0%
if they were doing inperson instruction
how<04:56:51.360><c> they</c><04:56:51.440><c> could</c><04:56:51.600><c> safely</c><04:56:51.920><c> do</c><04:56:52.160><c> that</c><04:56:52.320><c> as</c>

04:56:53.270 --> 04:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
how they could safely do that as
 

04:56:53.280 --> 04:56:56.030 align:start position:0%
how they could safely do that as
well<04:56:54.280><c> so</c><04:56:54.520><c> so</c><04:56:54.760><c> just</c><04:56:54.920><c> as</c><04:56:55.040><c> a</c><04:56:55.240><c> followup</c><04:56:55.680><c> as</c><04:56:55.840><c> we're</c>

04:56:56.030 --> 04:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
well so so just as a followup as we're
 

04:56:56.040 --> 04:56:58.190 align:start position:0%
well so so just as a followup as we're
unwinding<04:56:56.840><c> the</c><04:56:57.000><c> knot</c><04:56:57.360><c> and</c><04:56:57.480><c> figuring</c><04:56:57.878><c> out</c><04:56:58.080><c> what</c>

05:01:58.190 --> 05:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
don't have is where those gaps were
 

05:01:58.200 --> 05:02:00.430 align:start position:0%
don't have is where those gaps were

05:02:00.430 --> 05:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
closed and how those gaps were closed um
 

05:02:00.440 --> 05:02:03.230 align:start position:0%
closed and how those gaps were closed um
so<05:02:00.680><c> it</c><05:02:00.760><c> would</c><05:02:00.920><c> be</c><05:02:01.360><c> difficult</c><05:02:01.558><c> to</c><05:02:02.360><c> uh</c><05:02:02.558><c> connect</c>

05:02:03.230 --> 05:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
so it would be difficult to uh connect
 

05:02:03.240 --> 05:02:05.390 align:start position:0%

05:24:21.040 --> 05:24:26.230 align:start position:0%
in the PCR test
so<05:24:22.040><c> the</c><05:24:23.040><c> fouchi</c><05:24:23.638><c> said</c><05:24:24.240><c> that</c><05:24:24.920><c> there's</c><05:24:25.200><c> too</c><05:24:25.440><c> many</c>

05:24:26.230 --> 05:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
so the fouchi said that there's too many
 

05:24:26.240 --> 05:24:28.868 align:start position:0%
so the fouchi said that there's too many

and the World Health Organization said
 

05:24:28.878 --> 05:24:31.270 align:start position:0%
and the World Health Organization said

05:24:31.270 --> 05:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
basically this test can be manipulated
