00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
the House Health Human Services and
 
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs committee
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
for the record I am Mark Pearson
 
00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 align:start position:0%
chairman of the children and family law
 
00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.170 align:start position:0%
chairman of the children and family law
committee

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
my assignment as a member of the
 
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County delegation is our
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
nursing home of 226 Beds which puts me
 
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
right in the middle of what this bill is
 
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.350 align:start position:0%
right in the middle of what this bill is
about

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
the bill before you House Bill 215 would
 
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
allow the Department of Health and Human
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
Services to adopt rules that would
 
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
permit licensed nursing assistance also
 
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
known as lnas who take an extra course
 
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
so that they may pass medication to
 
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
participate in the tuition reimbursement
 
00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
program under the State Medicaid plan
 
00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
 
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
counties represented behind me worked
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
closely with DHHS last summer to ensure
 
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
that these lnas would be appropriately
 
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
included as people who could do this
 
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.189 align:start position:0%
included as people who could do this
task

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
task
 
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
such a change would be helpful in at
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
least two ways
 
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
first it would encourage lnas to expand
 
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
their careers with another step up the
 
00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.010 align:start position:0%
their careers with another step up the
ladder

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
ladder
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
secondly it would help even if in a
 
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 align:start position:0%
small way with our Workforce shortage
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities are facing so
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
that someone else could do a task that
 
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
someone much further up would no longer
 
00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
have to do and be able to do the tasks
 
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 align:start position:0%
they're specifically trained for
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
we received information
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
last Thursday timing people from the
 
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.930 align:start position:0%
last Thursday timing people from the
feds

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 align:start position:0%
feds
 
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.710 align:start position:0%
feds
that

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.370 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.110 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
federal government will not reimburse us
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
um research has just been done to find
 
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
out okay if we have to pay for it what
 
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
would it be and the figure is twenty
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that's it
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
and for twenty thousand dollars we are
 
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.490 align:start position:0%
and for twenty thousand dollars we are
helping

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
helping
 
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
people come up the ladder and we are
 
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:25.460 align:start position:0%
also making sure that in a little way
 
00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:28.699 align:start position:0%
some of the negatives of our Workforce
 
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
shortage could be mitigated so that is
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
my testimony on the bilser
 
00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:36.419 align:start position:0%

foreign

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:03.740 align:start position:0%

the legislative director for the New
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
Services and with me today is I'm Brian
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
Clark general counsel for the Bureau of
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
Illinois Adult Services and keeping our
 
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
testimony in the context of a
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
three-minute or less testimony we do
 
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
have wonderful folks coming behind us
 
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Association of
 
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:31.019 align:start position:0%
counties commissioner David Ross and
 
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
also miss Kate Horgan who worked really
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
diligently in engaging the department on
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
this important initiative simply put
 
00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
this initiative is a an attempt to
 
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
providing funding or a reimbursement for
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
training of lnas to become a a medical
 
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant and there's currently
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
already existing in-state process under
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
the office of licensure certification
 
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
professional excuse me office of
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
which almost took me to three minutes to
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
saying that entity's name that they are
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
are in fact the ones that do the
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
licensing under the Board of Nursing so
 
00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:10.019 align:start position:0%
this this is a really a helpful attempt
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of Workforce capacity to
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
opening it up to individuals to getting
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
this training
 
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
um and by um and the information that I
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
expect that you'll likely hear from
 
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Ross although we're looking
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
to what we're currently providing in
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
terms of reimbursement for lnas for
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
similar programs so to let you know this
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
is not new new or novel we're doing it
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
for lnas to provide an offset which the
 
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
FED does provide for a federal match so
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
these would be general fund dollars
 
00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339 align:start position:0%
based upon the directive that we receive
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
back from our the information received
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
back from the centers for Medicaid and
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid services that we
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
can't get a match so it's a really
 
00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:50.579 align:start position:0%
modest sum of an investment of twenty
 
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars general fund dollars
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
for each respective State fiscal year so
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
I do think this is a bill that although
 
00:10:59.690 --> 00:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
we did not take a position on we are
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
certainly supportive of initiatives that
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
promote Workforce capacity and the
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
numbers that I think you're going to
 
00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:08.579 align:start position:0%
hear from the counties are 100
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
individuals have been identified who
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
would Avail themselves of this
 
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
opportunity to having their training uh
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
cost reimbursed and the training costs I
 
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
understand is 200 per individual so I
 
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
apologize for stealing the Thunder of
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
the County Association but they'll be
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
here to testify on the good works that
 
00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:27.779 align:start position:0%
they do and we are so certainly
 
00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:29.579 align:start position:0%
supportive of the concept but there is a
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
need for a modest general fund
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation and from chairman Pearson
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
from the children family law committee I
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
understand there'll be a conversation uh
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
if this committee sees fit to seeing
 
00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:41.339 align:start position:0%
this is an important enough Bill to pass
 
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
to having conversation with division
 
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
three even though this is not an early
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
bill would not go before them but to
 
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
seeing working it into the house phase
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
of the budget for that investment
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:55.019 align:start position:0%
Tony Clark did you have any additional
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
comment or I do not do not okay
 
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for um for your
 
00:12:05.569 --> 00:12:05.579 align:start position:0%
testimony and helping us understand this
 
00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579 align:start position:0%
uh I'm wondering
 
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
um so you're saying that this training
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
is our there is some training that's
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
already going on that Medicaid is paying
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
for federal government is at
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so we are currently reimbursing a
 
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistants who complete
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
their licensed nursing assistant
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
training uh this would be a Medicaid
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
nursing uh medication nursing assistant
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
training on top of that so an additional
 
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
training that they would now have access
 
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.889 align:start position:0%
training that they would now have access
to

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering
 
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.949 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering
um

00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
how this particular language is allowing
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
that to happen since it's it's giving
 
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
authority to the department to create
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
administrative rules is it can you just
 
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
clarify oh
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
yes of course uh So currently we have
 
00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
administrative rules about our
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
reimbursement program and our
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement program is limited to
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
reimbursing for the licensed nursing
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
assistant training so this bill would be
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
directing us to expand it
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
I see another hand on this side
 
00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:17.339 align:start position:0%
any other questions oh yes
 
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy yeah thank you Mr
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:22.139 align:start position:0%
question just to be clear
 
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
um is the additional training they're
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
getting for administration of
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
medications beyond what they get in
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
their traditional LNA you know
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum wherever they previously
 
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.190 align:start position:0%
curriculum wherever they previously
trained

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
trained
 
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.949 align:start position:0%
trained
yes

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:35.959 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
one follow-up follow-up thank you um and
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
um stipulation as to which scheduled
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
drugs they are allowed to administer uh
 
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
at that as an l a
 
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of that question but I can
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
find out okay thank you
 
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
yes representative McLean so then just
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
to clarify after representative Murphy's
 
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
question the the program already exists
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
the the training already exists it's
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
just that currently
 
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
um either they're paying out of pocket
 
00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
or the counties are paying for it so
 
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
there's no change in the availability or
 
00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
the the curriculum it's just
 
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:27.829 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
question

00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
um I was hoping that you could also
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
provide some scope over what that
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
training is because I appreciate the low
 
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
cost of 200 but also with administering
 
00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:38.459 align:start position:0%
drugs that could have a narrow
 
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
therapeutic window I just like to better
 
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what training they're
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
doing they're getting and what they can
 
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
do with that training and chairman
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
McDonald and responding one of the
 
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
reasons why I stated up front that there
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
was an existing program it is managed by
 
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
The Entity oplc which I won't even try
 
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
again saying the entity's name so we're
 
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
really not in a position to getting into
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
the details of that training and again I
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
think that represent McLean specifically
 
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
addressed that this is about
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for those trainings that
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
already exist so this is not expanding
 
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
the scope of the training or changing it
 
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:09.860 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you
 
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.050 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you
gentlemen

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.060 align:start position:0%

licensed medication nursing assistance
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
as has already been presented before the
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
committee that licensed medication
 
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants are already approved
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire Board of
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
Nursing and they are functional we are
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
really looking to provide support to our

health care team
 
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
as part of the workforce shortage by

supporting our nurses with additional
 
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
resources to be able to help with
 
00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:32.339 align:start position:0%
medication administration medication
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
administration is only one facet of a
 
00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:37.019 align:start position:0%
licensed nurse's role in the long-term
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
care facility specifically we really
 
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
rely upon their skills and their
 
00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:44.339 align:start position:0%
education to be able to help us with
 
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%

um relieving them from responsibility of

administering routine medications
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
um which is takes up a support a
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
substantial part of their day we don't
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
want nurses tied to the med cart doing a
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
task that someone else can be
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately trained to do medication
 
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
assistants are able to give medications

certain types of medications they can't
 
00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:17.339 align:start position:0%
give injections and there's and they
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
can't give medications that are given
 
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
with certain parameters unless the
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
patient is actually assessed by a nurse
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
so if someone needs a medication because
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
they're presenting with new symptoms it
 
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
requires assessment by the nurse and
 
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
approval of the nurse to be able to give
 
00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
that medication so it's just those
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
routine medications that someone would
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
normally be taking much like in a home
 
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
setting where you know that someone's
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
taking medications at 9am 1 pm 2 p.m
 
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.409 align:start position:0%
taking medications at 9am 1 pm 2 p.m
routinely

00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
routinely
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
any changes in that require intervention
 
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
from the nurse
 
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
given the workforce shortage we want to
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
be able to free up nurses to be able to
 
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
I do have to make a correction to the
 
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
testimony today we didn't really quick
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
math this morning and we haven't had
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
enough coffee the the cost of the
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
program is two thousand dollars per
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
student and really we're looking for a
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
hundred students which would be two
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars not twenty
 
00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so it is substantially
 
00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:09.539 align:start position:0%
more than was presented earlier and I
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I'm I'm giving you
 
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
factual information but it is about an
 
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
80 hour
 
00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:18.299 align:start position:0%
um clinical class that they go through
 
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
um with classroom training where they're
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
learning about medications and then it's
 
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.510 align:start position:0%
learning about medications and then it's
additional

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
um 40 hours of clinical Hands-On
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
observation under the direct supervision
 
00:18:30.049 --> 00:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
of a nurse to make sure that they're
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
competent to do that
 
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
um they do receive a licensure by the
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
oplc as was previously testified so they
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
have to pass examinations so it's not
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
just a a pass-through process it is a
 
00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
rigorous training for those individuals
 
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
and I would just Echo uh administrators
 
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
Ross comments this is something that
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
could really assist the counties in
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
terms of Workforce and making sure that
 
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
we are serving our most vulnerable
 
00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
populations effectively
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
um we're happy to take any questions
 
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
that the committee has
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
yeah representative McLean thank you Mr
 
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking the
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate very much you
 
00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:09.299 align:start position:0%
clarifying you know the dollar amount
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
but two hundred thousand dollars is a
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
significantly bigger nugget than twenty
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
thousand so I have a two-part question
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
if the chair would indulge me the first
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
one is when the person completes this
 
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
course of training do they
 
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
um get an increase in compensation and
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
if they do you know about how much that
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
yes they do and it varies by facility so
 
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
it would be inappropriate for me to
 
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.270 align:start position:0%
it would be inappropriate for me to
share

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
um really what that would be I know for
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
our facility um it's about a two dollar
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
an hour increase in their compensation
 
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
and so just on the quick follow-up with
 
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
with that incentive already in existence
 
00:19:48.059 --> 00:19:49.210 align:start position:0%
with that incentive already in existence
um

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:49.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
realistically what kind of impact do you
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
think this would have as an additional
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
incentive seeing as the increased
 
00:19:59.150 --> 00:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
compensation is already there the
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
biggest barrier to many folks pursuing
 
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
their education is the cost of the
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
education itself so so being able to
 
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
provide the opportunity for folks to be
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
able to receive that education is
 
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
helping them make that step up
 
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
um Folks at the L A level are not highly
 
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
compensated individuals oftentimes
 
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
making between 15 and 17 dollars an hour
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
so coming up with the additional Monies
 
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
to be able to fund education is often
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
the highest barrier for them to pursue
 
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.669 align:start position:0%
the highest barrier for them to pursue
that

00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative Murphy
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
um from the administrative uh point of
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
view at the nursing home do you think
 
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
that this um enhancement of their
 
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
practicing at the top of their license
 
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
will allow you in some way or another to
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
open more beds which is clearly a
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
problem in the county homes
 
00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:54.539 align:start position:0%
ideally that is always Our Hope and for
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
us the biggest barrier to opening beds
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
is Workforce so anything that we can do
 
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
to be able to keep folks into the
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
healthcare Workforce is necessary right
 
00:21:08.289 --> 00:21:08.299 align:start position:0%
now we are losing Folks at the L A level
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
to non-health care Fields because of
 
00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
wage incentives providing a clinical
 
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
ladder an opportunity for professional
 
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
growth is an opportunity to be able to
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
keep folks in the field if they can make
 
00:21:21.289 --> 00:21:21.299 align:start position:0%
one more step towards becoming a
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
licensed nurse that is a great step
 
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
forward for us thank you
 
00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Cushman
 
00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:30.059 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and thanks for
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you Mr chairman
 
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
um do you know if this course that they
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
take can be applied if they go towards
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
credits to earning an LNA
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
like I mean sorry becoming an LPN
 
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
um I do not believe that it that it um
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
is applied towards their education but I
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
do believe that it does help them with
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
their practice and and that knowledge
 
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
because they are learning about
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
medications and they are learning about
 
00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
the clinical impacts of medications that
 
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
knowledge really gives them a leg up as
 
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
they're getting their nursing school
 
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.409 align:start position:0%
they're getting their nursing school
studies

00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
I would guess that there's a substantial
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
difference in Pay between
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
the people that would be taking this
 
00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
training and a regular nurse
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
so it would be saving the nurse who's
 
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
paid at a much higher rate a lot of time
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
to okay so it probably will pay for
 
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
itself thank you thank you
 
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.310 align:start position:0%
itself thank you thank you
representative

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I'm just trying to
 
00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
understand if the goal of this bill is
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
to deal with current crisis of
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage
 
00:22:54.529 --> 00:22:54.539 align:start position:0%
uh would it be possible to put some
 
00:22:59.289 --> 00:22:59.299 align:start position:0%
amendment to limit the scope of this
 
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
expenditure just to this crisis
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
situation so let's say even two years
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
this Workforce crisis will go away this
 
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
incentive may go over as well
 
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a possibility I would
 
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
applaud and appreciate any opportunity
 
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
to be able to help us in the interim
 
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.690 align:start position:0%
to be able to help us in the interim
um

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'll leave it at that just
 
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
to add to that representative uh we had
 
00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:33.299 align:start position:0%
a Workforce shortage in crisis before
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
covid came in covid made it worse but it
 
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:39.059 align:start position:0%
was uh we were already in a staffing
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
shortage in a staffing crisis before
 
00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:41.990 align:start position:0%
shortage in a staffing crisis before
kovid

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
kovid
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
and and if I can dovetail on that a
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
um the projections for
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
um the needs for long-term care going
 
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
forward only increase as our population
 
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
continues to age we are facing as you've
 
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
all heard the silver tsunami that it
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
that is coming and the need to be able
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
to build our health care Workforce is
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
going to be with us for many years to
 
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
come at a time when we have many more
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
nurses that are retiring than are
 
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
graduating so we need to do everything
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
in our power to be able to help build a
 
00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
Workforce in a way that's going to be
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
meaningful and sustainable
 
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
indulging me for a second question
 
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
um are the counties
 
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
um do you know if any of the County
 
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
nursing homes are are doing this kind of
 
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
tuition reimbursement now
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
many facilities throughout the counties
 
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
and throughout the state are providing
 
00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.350 align:start position:0%
and throughout the state are providing
that

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
um there just isn't a mechanism for
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for that through for those
 
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
individual facilities so there's an
 
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
additional cost and burden on Health
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
Care operations we're looking for
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
support from that
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay just a little clear uh clarifying
 
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.730 align:start position:0%
okay just a little clear uh clarifying
question

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
um so you're looking so right now it's
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
coming from the county budget and you're
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
looking to get reimbursed from the state
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you representative
 
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.570 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you representative
Lanza

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
Lanza
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
um so right now you're asking for a two
 
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
um well that also be uh for next year as
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
well included another 200 000 yes so
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
it's 2 200 000 annually yes all right
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
and um can I follow up with another
 
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.390 align:start position:0%
and um can I follow up with another
question

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
um the hundred student or the 100
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
nurse's aides that you'll be using is
 
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
that throughout the whole state or is
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
that just within uh certain counties
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
that would be throughout the state
 
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
throughout the state okay thank you
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:25:36.529 --> 00:25:36.539 align:start position:0%
yes representative King
 
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
questions will this be reimbursing any
 
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.590 align:start position:0%
 
potentially

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.250 align:start position:0%
potentially
um

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.570 align:start position:0%
um
potentially

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
um it the license the availability of
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
individuals to receive this program it
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
depends on I guess it would ultimately
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
depend on how the rules were written it
 
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
would come down this this bill
 
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.140 align:start position:0%
authorizes the development of rules so
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
how the rules were written would dictate
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
which facilities would be eligible
 
00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:09.539 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you all
 
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
in point of fact the dollar amount is a
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
red herring to this committee because
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
this committee is simply being asked for
 
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
policy change it is not an early bill it
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve money it isn't going to
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
division three for their approval it
 
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
just simply says may this be done may
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
lnas be trained to administer medicine
 
00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
how many are trained to do that and at
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
what cost is not the scope of the bill
 
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
and therefore not really Germaine at
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
this point to this committee
 
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
so in other words it doesn't mandate it
 
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
it just allows for it yes sir
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
any questions of these gentlemen
 
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you very much for
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
coming back up
 
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
um I I believe we had heard that some
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
people are that L A's are already
 
00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:21.539 align:start position:0%
getting this training I'm just curious
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
about that mechanism if this would be
 
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation and that's already
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
being provided if he could just help me
 
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.890 align:start position:0%
being provided if he could just help me
understand

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
and chairman McDonald a response to
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
represent Leon's question if you look at
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
the legislation itself it shows you
 
00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:39.539 align:start position:0%
where we're seeking to getting or not we
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
but the bill and the bill sponsor um is
 
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
bringing an amendment to adding uh the
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
um medication uh nursing assistance to
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
the current rulemaking Authority that we
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
have around licensed nursing assistance
 
00:27:54.049 --> 00:27:54.059 align:start position:0%
to getting this training so that's
 
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
already an existing law uh relative to
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
that mechanism for rulemaking as you
 
00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:00.059 align:start position:0%
heard from attorney Brian Clark we do
 
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
have roles in place already for that uh
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
point of clarification we do have within
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
our budget under class 504 on the class
 
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
line and appropriation for four hundred
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar general fund for the
 
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
biennium so those are request currently
 
00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
for the lnas and so that does mirror
 
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
somewhat what the testimony from the
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
county association's provided it was a
 
00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:24.539 align:start position:0%
little bit of a surprise to us the
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
increase by an additional zero to it but
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
as stated by represent Pearson this is a
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
very important mechanism all that is
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
being sought here is to adding the
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
ability for reimbursement of those funds
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
so whether there's zero dollars that are
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
put into the budget it would at least
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
still allow that mechanism for
 
00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for this important program
 
00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:45.179 align:start position:0%
or a sliding scale all the way up to
 
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
potentially the two hundred thousand
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
dollars that is a separate conversation
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
um with the legislature before division
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
three and health Finance there's nothing
 
00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation that creates an
 
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
appropriation or a funding mechanism
 
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
representative cofult
 
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
forgive me if I if this has been said
 
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
and I missed it but um
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this would
 
00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:14.990 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this would
shift

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
shift
 
00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:18.059 align:start position:0%
some tasks from
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
from licensed nurses to nurses
 
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.430 align:start position:0%
from licensed nurses to nurses
assistants

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
assistants
 
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
presumably that incurs some kind of
 
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
savings in the process has anybody done
 
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
an analysis on the cost savings that
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
would be offsetting some of the expenses
 
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
involved with this if it were to pass
 
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge representative what
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
I see it is a way to help with a serious
 
00:29:48.529 --> 00:29:48.539 align:start position:0%
shortage of help if an RN
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
is administering medications
 
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:54.539 align:start position:0%
that RN may not necessarily at that
 
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
moment be doing what the RN is trained
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
to do if a license nursing assistant can
 
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
do it now it will primarily in my
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
oh representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for indulging me
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
again reading this again closer and I
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
apologize for not doing that sooner it
 
00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
says that this is for this Improvement
 
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
of the program for assistance to nurses
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't see that defined anywhere my
 
00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:33.539 align:start position:0%
question is if having this for
 
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
assistance to nurses was actually
 
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
intended for licensed nursing assistance
 
00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:39.299 align:start position:0%
in the first place and some
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
clarification as to what an assistant
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
nurse actually is would be helpful
 
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
it clearly was
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
um and also the cross-reference that you
 
00:30:50.769 --> 00:30:50.779 align:start position:0%
can't see because it's not here to RSA
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
326 b14 Roman 2A that gets you to the
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
board of nursing statute so I'm sure if
 
00:30:59.330 --> 00:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
you pull up that statute will give you
 
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
better clarification as to the scope of
 
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
who it is that is being trained here uh
 
00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
to getting certified to providing
 
00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
medication under that program
 
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
so it's essentially an LNA that's a
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
heightened LNA that's allowed to
 
00:31:15.529 --> 00:31:15.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
thank you that makes sense it's the
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
assistance to nurses and the language
 
00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
that's there and it's probably would be
 
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
a matter of follow-up to understand what
 
00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:24.539 align:start position:0%
an assistant to nurses is when it's not
 
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
defined and and reply on that as we can
 
00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:30.539 align:start position:0%
see is in current law which is why we're
 
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
here only on the section so certainly if
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
your intent here is to clean the
 
00:31:36.409 --> 00:31:36.419 align:start position:0%
language up further
 
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
um certainly that's the will of the
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee and if you have time to do
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
that certainly I know the county
 
00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:42.299 align:start position:0%
associations and our agency would be a
 
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
resource to you
 
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you for uh
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
once again taking my question so is it
 
00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
fair to say that given that there's no
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh ask for appropriation that this is a
 
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
policy question regarding basically the
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
ability of everybody in the care
 
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
profession to practice up to their
 
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
license which then allows the improved
 
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
here may also lead to increasing the
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
ability to take care of more patients
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps even opening up as I mentioned
 
00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:12.110 align:start position:0%
perhaps even opening up as I mentioned
before

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions okay thank you
 
00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.730 align:start position:0%

no one else has signed up to speak on
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
House Bill 215 does anyone else wish to
 
00:32:32.039 --> 00:32:37.610 align:start position:0%
House Bill 215 does anyone else wish to
speak

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else I'm going to close
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 215 and
 
00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:45.059 align:start position:0%

Gary Merchant was unable to be with us
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
this morning he's asked representative
 
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
Erica Leon to present the bill in his
 
00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.690 align:start position:0%
Erica Leon to present the bill in his
place

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record I'm
 
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
representative Erica Leon from dairy
 
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
which is Rockingham 13. I am presenting
 
00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
this bill on the behalf of
 
00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:39.299 align:start position:0%
Representative Gary Merchant as a little
 
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
bit of background this is actually a
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
good fit as I do have some experience
 
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
with the home education advisory Council
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
which provides similar oversight
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
so I have the written testimony from
 
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative Marchant here
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
um I I will read that in although I know
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's normally not our procedure when
 
00:33:59.210 --> 00:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
I'm standing in for somebody it seems to
 
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
be appropriate
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
um this is representative Merchant
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%

state agency and not with the council
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
openness and transparency are essential
 
00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
components for fully functioning

00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
rulemaking the state agency solicits
 
00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
advice from the council however during
 
00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
at least one meeting the agency stated
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
that it does not need to follow Council
 
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:02.870 align:start position:0%
that it does not need to follow Council
advice

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
advice
 
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
this bill simply requires that when an
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
agency promulgates a rule that the
 
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
council votes on the final proposed rule
 
00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:11.339 align:start position:0%
via a roll call and that the outcome of
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
the vote be presented to the Joint
 
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:14.339 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
rules when the agency presents the final
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
role to gel car this language was
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
developed in collaboration with the
 
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:23.579 align:start position:0%
department and that is representative
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
Merchant's testimony
 
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
okay representative Leon are you taking
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
questions or I can try and answer them
 
00:35:31.849 --> 00:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
if there are any questions are there any
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Leon
 
00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak as
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
committee I want to give a parallel to
 
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
what representative Merchant has
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
proposed he and I have discussed this he
 
00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:08.220 align:start position:0%
thought it would be helpful for me to
 
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.650 align:start position:0%
thought it would be helpful for me to
share

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic I worked very
 
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
quietly with members of DHHS it wasn't
 
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
anything legal I didn't have a veto but
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
that collaborative work done very
 
00:36:26.089 --> 00:36:26.099 align:start position:0%
quietly I think helped considerably
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
today I meet with senior members of the
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
Judiciary of our state on the same kind
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
of thing only having to do with court
 
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.030 align:start position:0%
of thing only having to do with court
procedures

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
in addition last fall I worked with some
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
of the area agencies which look after
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
the developmentally delayed population
 
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
with some loved ones of DD people and
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
with relevant people at DHHS
 
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
things I learned from this shuttle
 
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.310 align:start position:0%
things I learned from this shuttle
diplomacy

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
diplomacy
 
00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
is that we need more transparency we
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
need more communication we need more
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
mutuality and what I'm seeing in
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Merchants Bill is saying
 
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
we do need checks and balances we do
 
00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:23.180 align:start position:0%
need oversight we do need collaboration
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
and as a result when his bill came
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
forward I said I'd like to talk with you
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
about my experiences and he said it
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
would only underscore what he's trying

prescription drug monitoring program

and we we appreciate the opportunity
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
also for the introduction of the bill
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
that Revenant Leon did an amazing job in
 
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
a place of Representative Merchant uh
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
represent Merchant did reach out to our
 
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:34.380 align:start position:0%

00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
administrator in our agency over to
 
00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:37.619 align:start position:0%
prescription drug monitoring program
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
this involves that advisory Council that
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
oversees that program he worked very
 
00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
diligently with us to strike the right
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
Accord between transparency and a um in
 
00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:50.099 align:start position:0%
recognition of the fact that the
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
department ultimately has the rulemaking
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
authority around this so with that uh we
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
are absolutely fine this is a
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
demonstration of a good approach to
 
00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
reaching out to State agencies to
 
00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
develop legislation and we appreciate
 
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to appearing for you
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
today Mr Holt I don't know if you had
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
anything to add the only thing I'd like
 
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
to add is that we cannot the department
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
can operate under the structure proposed
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you repeat that please
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
the department can operate under the
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
procedure proposed by the legislation
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
are you taking a position on the bill or
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
no you're not okay thank you uh
 
00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.430 align:start position:0%
no you're not okay thank you uh
questions

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative McLean
 
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
taking my question just bear with me I
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
think it took me up until your testimony
 
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
to understand what the bill does so I
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
apologize and I I just want to kind of
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
clarify so all that this bill is asking
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
them is that the agency puts forth a
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
rule then the advisory Council looks at
 
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
the rule and says we like it or we don't
 
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
like it they have a roll call vote and
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
when it goes to jailcar they're just
 
00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
able to compare the two to make a more
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
informed decision
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
the the Nuance here in this bill is that
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
that roll call vote happens on the final
 
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
proposal of the rule as opposed to the
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
initial proposal or while the rules
 
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
being developed uh there's a grant of
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
authority in the law already that
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
requires the advisory Council uh to make
 
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
recommendations on rulemaking uh which
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
is standard practice for advisory
 
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
councils and it would be standard
 
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
practice for the Department to engage
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
them throughout the rulemaking process
 
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
this adds a new Step where it would
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
require us to bring the final proposal
 
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
before the council for a roll call vote
 
00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
yay or nay and for the record uh Mr Holt
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
was the administrator for our
 
00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unit which you can
 
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
Cushman thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:40:47.089 --> 00:40:47.099 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so would this
 
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
mechanism be able to be used for interim
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
there is no final proposal
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
involved in the interim rulemaking
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
process or the emergency rulemaking
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
process and so those two forms of
 
00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
rulemaking are not contemplated in this
 
00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:12.370 align:start position:0%
rulemaking are not contemplated in this
bill

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:12.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions okay thank you
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
no one else has signed up to speak on
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 136 does anyone else wish to
 
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.930 align:start position:0%
House Bill 136 does anyone else wish to

from Lincoln and Woodstock uh and um
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
pleased to introduce hb642 this bill
 
01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:06.299 align:start position:0%
relates to prohibiting the Department of
 
01:02:08.089 --> 01:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
from enforcing salary caps for direct
 
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
care workers this bill is aimed at
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
solving a long-standing challenge with
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
older budgets in the developmental
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
Services System
 
01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:24.059 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't title doesn't tell the
 
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
full picture of what this piece of
 
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
legislation is attempted to accomplish
 
01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:30.380 align:start position:0%
so let me talk a little bit about it
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
first let's explore the first sentence
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:37.700 align:start position:0%
the department shall not establish or
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
enforce in statute or rule a limit or
 
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
cap on the salary or hourly wages of
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
direct support staff
 
01:02:48.849 --> 01:02:48.859 align:start position:0%
as recently as December of 21
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
dhh budget templates for developmental
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
Services would not allow direct support
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
professionals or dsps wages over
 
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
certainly our hourly rates without
 
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic justification while at the
 
01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
same time most entry-level jobs paid the
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
same level or above the DHHS threshold
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
this obviously created some challenges
 
01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
for fulfilling the services
 
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
um area agencies or non-profit private
 
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
corporations funded in large part
 
01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
through and supervised by the New
 
01:03:25.849 --> 01:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
Services Bureau of Developmental
 
01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
Services area agencies provide programs
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
and services for people with
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities in their
 
01:03:34.799 --> 01:03:36.069 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities in their
families

01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
the area agencies are pleased that this
 
01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
budget template cap is not is no longer
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
an issue as the practice has stopped at
 
01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:48.299 align:start position:0%
least for the time being however it is
 
01:03:50.569 --> 01:03:50.579 align:start position:0%
possible that these template thresholds
 
01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
could return in the future in part this
 
01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to avoid a future crisis
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
created when salary caps are instituted
 
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
so the focus of HB 642 is the ability
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
for area agencies to request a
 
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable cost of living adjustment to
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
an individual's budgets for budgets
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
older than two years old under the
 
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
current system if an individual comes
 
01:04:18.049 --> 01:04:18.059 align:start position:0%
off the way waitlist and has consistent
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
needs in life circumstances there is no
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
mechanism to raise the budget
 
01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
to the current labor and inflation
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
realities this puts both the service
 
01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
providers and the individual who receive
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
support at risk
 
01:04:34.089 --> 01:04:34.099 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
hb642 then is designed to work as
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
follows area agencies will request
 
01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:42.059 align:start position:0%
request additional funds for these older
 
01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:45.299 align:start position:0%
budgets if DHHS agrees that the request
 
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
is reasonable and funds are available
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
either through vacancies budget laps or
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
other sources DHHS must fund the request
 
01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
if the funds are not available then the
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
individuals can be placed on the wait
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
list as alleged Legacy budget this will
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
provide us with data on how many Legacy
 
01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
budgets will need to be addressed in the
 
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
cost to do so I noticed that the fiscal
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
note was updated
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
which indicates that there's no no added
 
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
cost for implementing this bill it's not
 
01:05:20.089 --> 01:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
about adding funds to the system it's
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
about increasing transparency on what we
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
were providing and what is needed not
 
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:26.660 align:start position:0%
force payment
 
01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
without appropriate additional funds
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
being allocated through the standard
 
01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.010 align:start position:0%
being allocated through the standard
process

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
so with that I I bring House Bill 642
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
for your consideration and I know
 
01:05:43.849 --> 01:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
there's there's people here who have
 
01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:45.980 align:start position:0%
more direct
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
interaction with the system to answer
 
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
questions but I'll be happy to try to
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
as well thank you
 
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.670 align:start position:0%
as well thank you
questions

01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:05:58.490 --> 01:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
that Senator Leon thank you Mr chairman
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for being
 
01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
here and introducing this bill
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
um I guess I have a two-part question my
 
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:07.700 align:start position:0%
first is if a redesign of the BDS system
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
would still Place Us in this same
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
situation and then the second part of
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
the question is if if these salary caps
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with Medicaid
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
you know my my understanding would be
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:06:33.049 --> 01:06:33.059 align:start position:0%
that the Medicaid matching funds would
 
01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
would is based on actual expenditures so
 
01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
um you know for providing a different
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
number of services but still the same
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
dollar amount than the Medicaid the
 
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
federal matching Provisions wouldn't
 
01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
change and um your your first question
 
01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:51.770 align:start position:0%
change and um your your first question
um

01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't think I know the
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
answer to that what I do know is the
 
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
system as it is now I've heard enough
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
direct examples when it's been an issue
 
01:07:00.119 --> 01:07:01.670 align:start position:0%
direct examples when it's been an issue
that

01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
um that it's currently an issue
 
01:07:04.859 --> 01:07:06.410 align:start position:0%
um that it's currently an issue
so

01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:06.950 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
and whether it wouldn't be an issue with
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
the change changes
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
um I can't I can't speak to that maybe
 
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
somebody else could
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
I'm saying no other questions thank you
 
01:07:31.609 --> 01:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
Melissa Nemeth from the Department of
 
01:07:45.049 --> 01:07:45.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:47.339 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
01:07:49.609 --> 01:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Melissa Nemeth
 
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
and I am the legislative liaison for the
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Developmental Services through
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
Services as as representative Stringham
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
pointed out there currently is not a
 
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
salary or wage cap for the payment to
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
direct support provider so what happens
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
currently is the area agency sends a
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
request for proposal and you know a
 
01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
provider agency will reflect what their
 
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
cost is to provide the service and a
 
01:08:19.849 --> 01:08:19.859 align:start position:0%
budget then comes to the Department of
 
01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services for approval
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
one of the line items in the budget is
 
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
the payment to the direct support
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
providers there is not a wage cap
 
01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
previously there was a their requirement
 
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
for a justification if the payment to a
 
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
direct support professional is going to
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
be over a certain threshold but that is
 
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
no longer the case so sort of what
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
happens in in today's world is that it's
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
a a little bit of a name your own price
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
where the provider agencies reflect what
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
their cost is to provide a service
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
Additionally the department does not
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
have the data as to whether when it
 
01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
approves a budget that says for example
 
01:09:08.209 --> 01:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
the hourly wage for a direct support
 
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
provider is say for example 15 per hour
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
well the department doesn't have data
 
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
for is if all of that fifteen dollars is
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
passed on by the provider agency to that
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
direct support professional
 
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
um so we're we're not sure if that is
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
the case or not it's up to the employer
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
to pay their uh staff the wage that they
 
01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
feel is appropriate
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
um so all of these factors are Again
 
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
part of the reason for a redesign that
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
the a portion of the redesign that the
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
department is going through with respect
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
to rates there has been a great deal of
 
01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
information gathered as to what does it
 
01:09:50.829 --> 01:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
actually cost to provide these services
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
and the department is working with a a
 
01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
contractor to take all of this
 
01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
information and develop rates going
 
01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
forward and it's going to be a rate per
 
01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:03.470 align:start position:0%
forward and it's going to be a rate per
service

01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
despite it being a rate per service part
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
of the underpinnings are
 
01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
there one of the most direct costs to
 
01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
provide these Services is what you have
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
to pay for labor so that is sort of at
 
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
the building block of what all these
 
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
rates are going to be
 
01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.649 align:start position:0%
rates are going to be
foreign

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:20.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
s are fair and Equitable across the
 
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
system for the service that is provided
 
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
um we're getting away from the system
 
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
that we have now that's not a provider
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
specific payment but rather a service
 
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
specific payment
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
with that being said as as they've been
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
referred to as Legacy budgets or budgets
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
that you know are are very old
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
the department is going to also review
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
these rates that the frequency with
 
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
which they're going to be reviewed has
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
not yet been determined but there is
 
01:10:58.130 --> 01:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
that will be an ongoing exercise so we
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
don't get to the place where we have you
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
know things are 30 years old
 
01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.830 align:start position:0%
know things are 30 years old
um

01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
they will be looked at on an ongoing
 
01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:08.460 align:start position:0%
basis and and to do that they will
 
01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
gather that will gather the costs from
 
01:11:11.689 --> 01:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
the providers like we've done now to
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
come up with the rates that are being
 
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
developed and those are they are in the
 
01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
process they have not been the new rates
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
have not been instituted yet the goal is
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
that they when they are developed they
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
will be piloted first so that
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
information can be gathered and then
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
assessments can be made as to whether
 
01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
those rates are appropriate for the
 
01:11:36.010 --> 01:11:36.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
the so the department uh it sort of
 
01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
feels a little bit premature at this
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
point to do a review of these budgets
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
when there is uh all this work going on
 
01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
the budgets are reviewed they will be
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
reviewed annually when someone has their
 
01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
service agreement written that outlines
 
01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
all the services that they are assessed
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
to need
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and and the budget is built it will
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
be based on services that support that
 
01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
individuals need so it well could be
 
01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
that budgets are going to change as part
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
of this process because we're moving to
 
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
a whole new methodology and so where the
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
department has that
 
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
stepwise plan in mind that's going to be
 
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
piloted it feels like doing a review now
 
01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:22.940 align:start position:0%
would be a little bit premature
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
and it if I could wrap up I heard the
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
buzzer sorry currently one of the
 
01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:31.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:34.209 align:start position:0%
 
hem503.13

01:12:34.209 --> 01:12:34.219 align:start position:0%
hem503.13
 
01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
prohibits agencies when they're making
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
their budget requests from including
 
01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
such things as cost of living or other
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
wage and compensation increases so the
 
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
department has not
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
captured that in the appropriation
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
requests to the legislature nor has the
 
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
legislature accounted for that so a
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
potential while it's not a fiscal impact
 
01:12:59.930 --> 01:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
to the in the sense that it would
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
require more money necessarily right now
 
01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
if the request is to work within the
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
current appropriation
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
if the current appropriation is used to
 
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
address these older budgets it could be
 
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
that folks that are waiting for and have
 
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
not received services and who were
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
projected to receive Services as part of
 
01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
that appropriation May then not be
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
getting those services and there may be
 
01:13:21.169 --> 01:13:21.179 align:start position:0%
a wait list created
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to take any
 
01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.110 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to take any
questions

01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you questions representative
 
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.070 align:start position:0%
thank you questions representative
McLean

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
McLean
 
01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:13:31.199 --> 01:13:32.510 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um so

01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds like from your testimony that
 
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
this legislation is a little bit
 
01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:40.310 align:start position:0%
this legislation is a little bit
premature

01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
premature
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
um however I'm trying to put all the
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
pieces together in my mind it sounds
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
like it's a very complex process that I
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't really understand so it's hard for
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
me to make that determination would it
 
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
be possible
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
um for you to provide to the committee
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
some kind of like a process flow chart
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
or something so we can kind of
 
01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
understand how the pieces of the puzzle
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
go together
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
um because I think for me that would be
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
helpful anyways because I'm I'm having a
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
bit of a tough time following the whole
 
01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
process uh sure so to be clear are you
 
01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
looking for how the budgets are
 
01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
developed now and then a comparator as
 
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
yes something like that I just wanna so
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
someone they put in a put in the request
 
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
you go through you you're evaluating you
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
set the rates what are we looking at now
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
what are we looking at in the future
 
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
um I think there's a lot of discussion
 
01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
about that I think on some other bills
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
too and I think at least for me it would
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
be very clarifying to better understand
 
01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:43.739 align:start position:0%
these two different processes so it'll
 
01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
be helpful if you could do it yes I'd be
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
happy to do that
 
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
seeing Oh representative Leon thank you
 
01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking the
 
01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:55.970 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking the
question

01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to clarify how many people
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
are currently on the wait list I would
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
have to ask I'm sorry I did not come
 
01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
prepared with that information thank you
 
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you Mr chair
 
01:15:12.649 --> 01:15:12.659 align:start position:0%
are you in favor or against this bill I
 
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
and the department is here just to
 
01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
provide information thank you
 
01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
see no other questions thank you thank
 
01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:30.169 align:start position:0%
see no other questions thank you thank
you

01:15:30.169 --> 01:15:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Alex katrupus
 
01:15:34.729 --> 01:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
from csni
 
01:15:37.729 --> 01:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
and I also see someone else from csni do
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
you both want to come up or or do you
 
01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
want to do it individually
 
01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.070 align:start position:0%
want to do it individually
look

01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
sure that's fine but we'll be brief uh
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I most of my
 
01:15:52.729 --> 01:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
testimony was actually uh conveyed to
 
01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
you by representative Stringham I
 
01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
thought did a very good job explaining
 
01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
the issues
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
there's really two components to this
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
bill the first sentence of the bill is
 
01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
the issue with the wage threshold that
 
01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
was a
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
it was a major issue for the area
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
agencies because
 
01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
as representative Stringham said they
 
01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:12.530 align:start position:0%
as representative Stringham said they
are

01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
competing with retail establishments
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
fast food restaurants other entry-level
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
jobs for these workers
 
01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:22.100 align:start position:0%
and to have that bureaucratic
 
01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
justification threshold whatever you
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
want to call it it's probably not fair
 
01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
to call it a salary cap but it was an
 
01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:29.689 align:start position:0%
to call it a salary cap but it was an
impediment

01:16:29.689 --> 01:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
impediment
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
to the area agencies delivering their
 
01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
services and executing the budget that
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
the folks in this room passed and there
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
there was dollars there are dollars in
 
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
the budget to pay above the cap which is
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
why they no longer enforce that practice
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
so I think the first sentence of the
 
01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
bill is is fairly straightforward to me
 
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
the most important part of the bill is
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
is the second component and I I would
 
01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
not say that this bill is premature I
 
01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
say that it's long overdue this issue of
 
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
the Legacy budgets has been a problem
 
01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
for for many many years and really this
 
01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
this bill is an attempt to give the
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
department another tool to manage their
 
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
budget and if they have concerns that
 
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
addressing some of these Legacy budgets
 
01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
will put more people on the wait list
 
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
than they should not uh appropriate that
 
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
level of funding but couldn't we at
 
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
least give folks an opportunity I mean
 
01:17:24.169 --> 01:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
I've heard stories I don't know if it's
 
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
still true but there are people who a
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
few years ago had the same budget that
 
01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
they were awarded when they left Laconia
 
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
State School in 1991 it hasn't changed a
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
lot of people in developmental Services
 
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
System have consistent needs and under
 
01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
the current laws and the rsas if your
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
needs don't change your budget remains
 
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
flat and as people with developmental
 
01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
disabilities live longer lives
 
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
these budgets don't work anymore and uh
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
there's significant dollars available I
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
wish representative Weber was here
 
01:17:57.649 --> 01:17:57.659 align:start position:0%
because she brought this issue up at the
 
01:17:59.570 --> 01:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
oversight committee on Friday the
 
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
department has significant lapse dollars
 
01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
this budget is is going to have is going
 
01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
to recognize a lot of unspent dollars so
 
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
if there are dollars that are available
 
01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
that can be redirected even if we took
 
01:18:15.169 --> 01:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
off five or ten of these older budgets
 
01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis it would at least
 
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
begin to solve this problem we're not
 
01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
saying that this is going to create a
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
huge fiscal impact I don't think that
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
the budgets are significant in number
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
but there there is a legitimate problem
 
01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
out there and this just gives the
 
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
department another tool to manage its
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
budget the discretion under this bill is
 
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
all in their control they they can
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
manage their dollars execute the budget
 
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
and certainly the intent of this is not
 
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
to create
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
is not to create a wait list but the
 
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
other side of that is if we have a
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
budget that was approved 10 years ago
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's paying 11 an hour for direct
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
support professional
 
01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh today that but that person maybe a
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
very similar uh individual maybe getting
 
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
16.50 an hour
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
so so how do we reconcile that if
 
01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
there's dollars there let's redirect
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
them to the need that that that's what
 
01:19:09.169 --> 01:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to do and if the
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
dollars are not there then this bill
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
says let's let's at least get a registry
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
and a list of those people so that we
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
know what the costs are and then the
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
legislature can can either fund those
 
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
needs or fund part of those needs and we
 
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
can try to move forward to solve this
 
01:19:24.649 --> 01:19:24.659 align:start position:0%
issue okay thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and could we get a copy of
 
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Rebecca
 
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
and again we are we have a few minutes
 
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
we're asking people to hold the
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
testimony for three minutes
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
this morning in favor of House Bill 642
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
as the current CEO of Lakes Region
 
01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
Community Services the designated area
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
agency for Region 3 and having served as
 
01:20:12.649 --> 01:20:12.659 align:start position:0%
the CFO for over 10 years prior to my
 
01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
current position I wholeheartedly
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
support this bill which is long overdue
 
01:20:18.890 --> 01:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
and not premature and brings to light
 
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
one of the root causes of our inability
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
to retain and recruit direct care
 
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
workers just as a side note I get
 
01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
updated on these numbers daily the
 
01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
budgets that we're talking about are
 
01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
individuals and their lives a budget
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
represents a life that we're serving I
 
01:20:35.649 --> 01:20:35.659 align:start position:0%
currently am short 2
 
01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
325 hours per week of direct support
 
01:20:42.649 --> 01:20:42.659 align:start position:0%
workers in my region alone we're
 
01:20:44.530 --> 01:20:44.540 align:start position:0%
currently short
 
01:20:48.649 --> 01:20:48.659 align:start position:0%
748.25 hours per week in individuals who
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
are waiting for services to come back
 
01:20:52.729 --> 01:20:52.739 align:start position:0%
after covid they're with their families
 
01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
they're getting partial services but I'm
 
01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
not fulfilling current isps individual
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
service plans short just in my day
 
01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:00.970 align:start position:0%
service plans short just in my day
program

01:21:00.970 --> 01:21:00.980 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
748 hours a week
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
for many years two factors have tied our
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
hands and effectively capped DSP wages
 
01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
one that you've heard reference to today
 
01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
was the literal capping within the
 
01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
budget template of the Excel cell in
 
01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
which we entered the DSP wage that cell
 
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
was capped and Frozen we could not edit
 
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
that up until two years ago
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
a practice that has only been corrected
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
recently the other was the
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
administrative rule that you've heard
 
01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
reference to the for adding individuals
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
to the wait list as you well know
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
there's two sides to a budget the
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
revenue side and the expense side you're
 
01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
accustomed to Medicaid providers in the
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
area agencies advocating for a rate
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
increase in this situation we're asking
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
within the current reimbursement rate
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
for the ability to adjust to actual
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
expenses necessary to provide the
 
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:49.910 align:start position:0%
expenses necessary to provide the
services

01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:21:52.330 --> 01:21:52.340 align:start position:0%
as you've also heard this morning in hem
 
01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
50313 under the allocation of funds
 
01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
section g at States and completing the
 
01:21:59.689 --> 01:21:59.699 align:start position:0%
waitlist registry the area agency shall
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
exclude those circumstances where funds
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
might be needed to cover additional
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures such as cost of living or
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
other wage and compensation increases
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know about you but that's a
 
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
really difficult way to do business if
 
01:22:15.169 --> 01:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
you've ever been in business that means
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
we cannot ever come forward for an
 
01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
individual and say that the reason we
 
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
need a budget increase is because our
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
costs have increased
 
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
once an individual budget is approved by
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
BDS and I could happily walk you through
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
that process the only other way to ever
 
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
increase the budget is by placing the
 
01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
individual on the wait list but we're
 
01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
being told in the reg that we can't do
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
that by precluding the ability to place
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
an individual on the waitlist for wage
 
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
increases we've created 30 plus Years of
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
Legacy budgets and kept both families
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
and agencies from being competitive
 
01:22:46.679 --> 01:22:48.350 align:start position:0%
and agencies from being competitive
employers

01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
so it seems pretty straightforward to me
 
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
I've lived in the weeds for 17 years I'd
 
01:22:55.010 --> 01:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
be happy to take questions I can
 
01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
certainly I've got a lot of notes I can
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
answer all the questions that have Briar
 
01:23:00.649 --> 01:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
been asked at least from an area agency
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
perspective thank you thank you
 
01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.750 align:start position:0%
perspective thank you thank you
questions

01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions
 
01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for coming with
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
all of this information
 
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
my question I'm not sure if you're the
 
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
right one to answer it around the rules
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
but if simply that rule around
 
01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
503.13 was changed so that that was no
 
01:23:26.689 --> 01:23:26.699 align:start position:0%
longer limiting would that be something
 
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
that you think would address this the
 
01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:29.390 align:start position:0%
that you think would address this the
problem

01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it would untie the
 
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
Department's hands from being able to
 
01:23:34.729 --> 01:23:34.739 align:start position:0%
allow us to put someone on the wait list
 
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
for a wage increase currently on a
 
01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
regular basis I will hear from a vendor
 
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
so some area agencies are provider
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
agencies we actually provide the
 
01:23:45.410 --> 01:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
services some area agencies use all
 
01:23:47.570 --> 01:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
contracts with vendors our vendors
 
01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
currently will reach out and say and
 
01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
this has happened to me with a very
 
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
large New Hampshire vendor if we don't
 
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
get these budget increases passed on
 
01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
these nine individuals I'm giving notice
 
01:23:58.729 --> 01:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
on them I've received that message three
 
01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
times this year from that vendor then in
 
01:24:02.630 --> 01:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
order to get that increase from the
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
bureau and put them on the wait list I
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
have to go back to that vendor and say I
 
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
need a justification that has nothing to
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
do with wages because the first email
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
says because we need to pay twenty
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour to get staff So
 
01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
currently in my opinion as a former CFO
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
we're really bordering on the line of
 
01:24:21.169 --> 01:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fraud when we say to a vendor
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
you need to give us a justification as
 
01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
to why they're going to go on the wait
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
list because it can't be for wages but
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
we are so scared that we're going to
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
have them give notice on those
 
01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
individuals that and you heard my
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
numbers on where I'm short in my region
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have providers in New Hampshire
 
01:24:38.810 --> 01:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
and we don't have staff So currently
 
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
that is the process I hope that answers
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
your question it does thank you
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you
 
01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.570 --> 01:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm gonna try to pronounce this last
 
01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
how did I do with the name
 
01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:21.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
please turn your microphone on
 
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
I am a member of the New Hampshire
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
Council of Developmental Disabilities as
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
a policy chairperson I'm speaking on
 
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
behalf of the council
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
we support HB 642 only if it's amended
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
we support the prohibiting of the
 
01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
capping of salaries whether it comes
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
both factual and anecdotal data we know
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
that direct providers wages are
 
01:26:09.729 --> 01:26:09.739 align:start position:0%
extremely low
 
01:26:09.739 --> 01:26:11.450 align:start position:0%
extremely low
dhss

01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
dhss
 
01:26:14.649 --> 01:26:14.659 align:start position:0%
has put caps on the salary or hourly
 
01:26:18.169 --> 01:26:18.179 align:start position:0%
wages these workers can earn McDonald's
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
in the state pays more than what a DSP
 
01:26:23.689 --> 01:26:23.699 align:start position:0%
can earn
 
01:26:27.169 --> 01:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
and it is a easier job
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
for this reason many families are going
 
01:26:33.169 --> 01:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
without the support they need the
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage has made many
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
families have to make difficult
 
01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
decisions the only reason I can be here
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
today is my husband has the flexibility
 
01:26:47.689 --> 01:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
to work from home one day a week
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
yet in my son's budget he is entitled to
 
01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
a DSP for 30 hours a week
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
for the past three years we have been
 
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
unable to find a worker to work at the
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
hourly rate cap for my son my son
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
deserves to be supported in the
 
01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
community without his mom and dad
 
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
every adult deserves to have a life in
 
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
community that does not always include
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
as parents and adult child I am aware
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
our budget hasn't changed for years
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
I'm also aware that the DD waiver system
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
is in redesign
 
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
it is not clear at this time how budgets
 
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
will be established moving forward nor
 
01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
do we know the rates nor do we know how
 
01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:49.340 align:start position:0%
these rates will affect
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who are on person directed
 
01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.689 align:start position:0%
individuals who are on person directed
self-management

01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
self-management
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
the question is how can the area agency
 
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
and the service provider negotiate
 
01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
family service budgets without knowing
 
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
the changes and also they are not clear
 
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
in this legislation will the rates be
 
01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
passed through to the families
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
or the DSP workers
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
that is unclear We Have Heard
 
01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.209 align:start position:0%
that is unclear We Have Heard
that

01:28:25.209 --> 01:28:25.219 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:28.129 --> 01:28:28.139 align:start position:0%
there have problems
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's important
 
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
for the council to have questions
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
answered in legislation
 
01:28:47.090 --> 01:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
before legislation goes through we are
 
01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
here to talk about families
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately at times that does include
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
area agencies and service providers
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
but today
 
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:00.780 align:start position:0%
we are concerned about the families
 
01:29:03.169 --> 01:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:29:06.110 --> 01:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
and we could get a copy of the testimony
 
01:29:08.639 --> 01:29:17.270 align:start position:0%
and we could get a copy of the testimony
ma'am

01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning thank you for
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
the time yeah three minutes sir my name
 
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
is Will Walker I live in Hollis New
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with my wife and a 23 year old
 
01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
son with autism I'm here to ask for your
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
support for HB 642 what I believe it
 
01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
does is help retain our most skilled and
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
experienced workers I believe the
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
current system does the exact opposite
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
of that it encourages our workers after
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
a few years to exit the system because
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
they are not compensated appropriately
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
um so I want to give a quick explanation
 
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
of the process of what it's like to find
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
a DSP okay so we go to the state not the
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
state we go to our area agency we
 
01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
develop a service plan we get a budget
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay we have to then hire somebody while
 
01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
our son is not receiving Services we
 
01:30:19.010 --> 01:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
have to hire somebody find somebody hire
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
them and bring them on board and that
 
01:30:22.729 --> 01:30:22.739 align:start position:0%
person had to develop a rapport with our
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
son that takes at least six months okay
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
and I would say it's six to eight months
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay during that time we have to be at
 
01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
home and provide 24 7 care for our son
 
01:30:32.930 --> 01:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
that limits our ability to find gainful
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
employment okay it provides a very
 
01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
challenging environment for us so let's
 
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
say we find somebody
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
and a DSP to come worked with our son
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
and great they develop a rapport with
 
01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
their son a year fast forward great
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
everything's going fine two years come
 
01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
along cost of living has gone up the
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
budget remains flat the only way we can
 
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
change that budget is by doing an
 
01:30:58.129 --> 01:30:58.139 align:start position:0%
exception okay and the exceptions are
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
not put at the top of the list my
 
01:31:01.129 --> 01:31:01.139 align:start position:0%
understandings are put further down the
 
01:31:02.689 --> 01:31:02.699 align:start position:0%
list so it's likely we're not going to
 
01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
receive that exception it's likely that
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
as two years experience or or more that
 
01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:09.780 align:start position:0%
our DSP has developed
 
01:31:12.110 --> 01:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get a livable wage
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
a working wage and they have to leave
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay so a very skilled person we
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
encourage them to get out of the system
 
01:31:19.729 --> 01:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
because we're not going to increase your
 
01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
rates okay that's that's what we're
 
01:31:23.570 --> 01:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
facing and then what will happen is two
 
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
years okay we go through the whole
 
01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:26.699 align:start position:0%
process again we have to find another
 
01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
DSP it's going to take six months or so
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
there's an extreme Workforce shortage
 
01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
problem right now
 
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
we have to find another DSP we have to
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
go the whole process all over again all
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
right so this bill I believe will help
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
address that maybe it's not going to
 
01:31:41.450 --> 01:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
solve the problem but at least will help
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
cost of living uh your wages track the
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
cost of living okay so that's that's
 
01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
where I stand so I I would encourage you
 
01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
to support hb642 uh the other thing is
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
we have hb608 which we gave testimony on
 
01:31:56.209 --> 01:31:56.219 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks ago that's about the BDS
 
01:31:58.010 --> 01:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
system redesign looking the two-tier
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
waiver structure okay separate those
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
problems don't conflate these things
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
together don't join the BDS system
 
01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
transformation with this bill these
 
01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
things are separable problems okay so
 
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
don't don't set the success of this on
 
01:32:13.850 --> 01:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
the success of this BDS system
 
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:15.780 align:start position:0%
transformation which is still undergoing
 
01:32:19.010 --> 01:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
a change okay okay thank you
 
01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:21.110 align:start position:0%
a change okay okay thank you
questions

01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question just I'm just trying
 
01:32:28.129 --> 01:32:28.139 align:start position:0%
to understand the process and I'm
 
01:32:30.649 --> 01:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
relatively new to it so so you you go
 
01:32:32.810 --> 01:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
through all this work you you have a
 
01:32:35.689 --> 01:32:35.699 align:start position:0%
provider you're comfortable but now the
 
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
cost of living goes up and you say you
 
01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
you can't there's no way to amend the
 
01:32:42.530 --> 01:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
budget you say except by applying for an
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
exemption is that what you said
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
exception exceptional yes yes so what's
 
01:32:51.050 --> 01:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
involved in that and what are the kinds
 
01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
of things that you can look to in the
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
exception okay so the the reason you
 
01:32:57.649 --> 01:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
would need an exception is that if your
 
01:32:59.090 --> 01:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
needs stay the same your service plan
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
stays the same so things haven't changed
 
01:33:01.970 --> 01:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
which is you know probably pretty
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
typical okay so what do we do we work
 
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
with our area agency they help with
 
01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
providing that exception I don't know
 
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
the exact machinations to make that
 
01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
happen Okay but my understanding it's
 
01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:17.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
but the exception does not allow for
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
cost of living though um or it does or
 
01:33:23.689 --> 01:33:23.699 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
01:33:25.970 --> 01:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I can't answer definitively on
 
01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
that I just I just think it's it's a
 
01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
very challenging process and what this
 
01:33:31.610 --> 01:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
bill would do would be able to at least
 
01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
allow that to track without an exception
 
01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
process okay thank you
 
01:33:38.689 --> 01:33:38.699 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
see no other questions okay thank you
 
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:59.390 --> 01:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:02.219 align:start position:0%

Services and elderly Affairs committee I
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
am a little rusty it has been a while
 
01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
since I have had the pleasure of
 
01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
testifying in front of this committee
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
um again my name is Karen Blake I live
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
in North Woodstock New Hampshire
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
um for full disclosure I am also the
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
director of public policy for csni but
 
01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
um today I'm speaking as a private
 
01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.390 align:start position:0%
um today I'm speaking as a private
citizen

01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
um I am in support of um
 
01:34:39.290 --> 01:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
HB 642 this bill actually has you know
 
01:34:40.610 --> 01:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
the two issues that the people
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
previously have discussed you know the
 
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
first issue is to ensure that there
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
isn't a future hourly rate cap for
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
direct support professionals and the
 
01:34:52.370 --> 01:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
second is to address uh what is known as
 
01:34:54.410 --> 01:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
Legacy budgets for the adult service
 
01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:55.790 align:start position:0%
Legacy budgets for the adult service
system

01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
ensuring that there's no hourly rate cap
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
for direct service professionals will
 
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
help for some flexibility in hiring and
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully help retain direct support
 
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
professionals my understanding is the
 
01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
rate cap for direct support
 
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
professionals was in the recent past
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
but the bigger issue at least as far as
 
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned is looking at Legacy
 
01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:17.169 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned is looking at Legacy
budgets

01:35:17.169 --> 01:35:17.179 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
my understanding of how the system works
 
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
currently is that there are very
 
01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
specific reasons you know that there's
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
funding you know you have your you know
 
01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
T you know teens that are transitioning
 
01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
onto the adult service system we have
 
01:35:35.570 --> 01:35:35.580 align:start position:0%
you know someone coming new into the
 
01:35:38.570 --> 01:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
state or being no newly noted in the
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
state I actually know of one individual
 
01:35:41.890 --> 01:35:41.900 align:start position:0%
in my community
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
and then there has to be a significant
 
01:35:47.890 --> 01:35:47.900 align:start position:0%
change so what I'm hoping that this this
 
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
committee will approve especially a part
 
01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
of this bill is another way to increase
 
01:35:56.689 --> 01:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
a budget if need be cost of living
 
01:35:59.450 --> 01:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
or if there's inflation and as we've
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
seen in the last you know the last two
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
years inflation has gone up
 
01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.870 align:start position:0%
years inflation has gone up
significantly

01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
um you know your dollars that that were
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
worth you know something a year ago is
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
not the same that's worth today I know
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
me and everyone else is struggling a lot
 
01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:16.860 align:start position:0%
of times with you know all of the
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
day-to-day monthly income things that
 
01:36:21.290 --> 01:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
have gone up
 
01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
um you know and what the way that I
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
really kind of think about these Legacy
 
01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
budgets is kind of like a fixed income
 
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
you know you you're on a fixed income
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
and your dollars today are not going to
 
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
be worth the same tomorrow
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
um so why is this important to me
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
um I am a family member
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
um I have a young person who is going to
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
be transitioning into the adult service
 
01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.330 align:start position:0%
be transitioning into the adult service
system

01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
um I want to ensure that he and
 
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
individuals like him have the
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility to have a great hourly rate
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
to get a direct support professional
 
01:37:00.050 --> 01:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
hold on to that direct support
 
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
professional but also in the future make
 
01:37:05.689 --> 01:37:05.699 align:start position:0%
sure that there's enough money in his
 
01:37:08.810 --> 01:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
budget to cover all of those expenses
 
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
um you know that he isn't going to be
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
fixed into
 
01:37:14.209 --> 01:37:14.219 align:start position:0%
one budget and I know that there's a lot
 
01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
going on with the BDS
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
um you know system of work and system
 
01:37:21.110 --> 01:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
redesign and I I have to Echo what will
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%

01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
separate issues um you know into kind of

01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
talking about today
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is really important and I
 
01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
agree with Alex it is a really valuable
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
tool budget tool and it is long overdue
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
and we can't continue to wait to think
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
that there are even individuals who left
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
Laconia and 30 years later could have
 
01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
the same budget is just not okay you
 
01:38:53.689 --> 01:38:53.699 align:start position:0%
know this is a small community you get
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
to know a lot of other families and I
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
know many families that have had the
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
same budgets for more than five years
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
and some more than 10 years
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm a devoted parent and my daughter
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
Chloe experiences a significant
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
developmental disability she served by
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
gateways Community Services on the
 
01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
developmental disability waiver and we
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
actually use a pdms model that means
 
01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
that we don't hire a vendor per se pdms
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
stands for person directed managed
 
01:39:25.129 --> 01:39:25.139 align:start position:0%
services so as the family I organize her
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
program I put out ads to hire people I
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
supervise those people evaluate those
 
01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
workers provide training to those
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
workers a lot goes in when you bring on
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
a new worker like will had mentioned
 
01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.189 align:start position:0%
a new worker like will had mentioned
um

01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
given the fact that there is no
 
01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
workable mechanism right now to increase
 
01:39:50.770 --> 01:39:50.780 align:start position:0%
budgets for cost of living adjustments
 
01:39:54.410 --> 01:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
that means that in order to increase my
 
01:39:57.530 --> 01:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
DSP wages we have to realize fewer hours
 
01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
of services so over time the family
 
01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
continues to take on more and more and
 
01:40:03.239 --> 01:40:04.209 align:start position:0%
continues to take on more and more and
more

01:40:04.209 --> 01:40:04.219 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility my husband and I also
 
01:40:09.229 --> 01:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
provide overnight care Chloe got up four
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
times last night she has a seizure
 
01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
disorder significant intellectual and
 
01:40:15.649 --> 01:40:15.659 align:start position:0%
developmental disability you know we're
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
partners with the state and we want to
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
do all that we can to ensure that she
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
can live a meaningful life in the
 
01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
community and be as productive as
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
possible we also help to support her to
 
01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
open her own little small business
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
there's some pictures on the back of my
 
01:40:32.990 --> 01:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
testimony of Chloe working she likes to
 
01:40:34.729 --> 01:40:34.739 align:start position:0%
have a sense of purpose
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
this is unsustainable my husband and I
 
01:40:39.290 --> 01:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
while we're able to work remotely right
 
01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:40.490 align:start position:0%
while we're able to work remotely right
now

01:40:40.490 --> 01:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
he's with her right now I'll have to be
 
01:40:44.689 --> 01:40:44.699 align:start position:0%
with her this afternoon we work late
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
into the evening so 24 7. it's
 
01:40:49.010 --> 01:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
caregiving and it's working so that we
 
01:40:51.850 --> 01:40:51.860 align:start position:0%
can keep our jobs pay our bills and be
 
01:40:55.610 --> 01:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
contributing members to society but this
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
can't last forever I'm getting older my
 
01:40:59.570 --> 01:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
husband's getting older many families
 
01:41:01.129 --> 01:41:01.139 align:start position:0%
are getting older it's my understanding
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
about 80 percent of individuals still
 
01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
live at home with their families and and
 
01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
those parents are aging and aren't
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
unable to do more and more sometimes
 
01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
there's not like a specific change of
 
01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
life circumstance but again if we don't
 
01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
have this mechanism the budget stays the
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
same and the only way to increase your
 
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
DSP page is to get fewer hours of
 
01:41:25.729 --> 01:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
services so I absolutely urge you to
 
01:41:28.729 --> 01:41:28.739 align:start position:0%
pass this bill and create some way or a
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism so that can happen now I know
 
01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:32.870 align:start position:0%
mechanism so that can happen now I know
that

01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:33.470 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
this may mean that some people would be
 
01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
on a wait list it might create a legacy
 
01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
wait list and you know we can definitely
 
01:41:45.169 --> 01:41:45.179 align:start position:0%
work on that later but policy making is
 
01:41:47.209 --> 01:41:47.219 align:start position:0%
iterative this is the first step to
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
seeing the problem it's not part of the
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
you know shouldn't be dependent on the
 
01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
BDS system redesign there are some
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
serious concerns with the rate
 
01:41:58.010 --> 01:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
methodologies that are being developed
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
and tying budgets to this supports
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
intensity scale and I have a lot of
 
01:42:05.290 --> 01:42:05.300 align:start position:0%
questions as a family who takes that
 
01:42:07.129 --> 01:42:07.139 align:start position:0%
pdms model
 
01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
and I'm doing all this work to create
 
01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:11.300 align:start position:0%
and manage her program
 
01:42:14.090 --> 01:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
how those rates will affect families
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
like mine so I urge you to please
 
01:42:18.169 --> 01:42:18.179 align:start position:0%
support this bill create the mechanism
 
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
this is one step in the right direction
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
and it's the right thing to do thank you
 
01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.550 align:start position:0%
and it's the right thing to do thank you
questions

01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:28.139 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions
 
01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
no one else has signed up to testify on
 
01:42:36.890 --> 01:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
House Bill 642 does anybody else wish to
 
01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:39.350 align:start position:0%
House Bill 642 does anybody else wish to
testify

01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
seeing no one I am going to close the
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 642 and
 
01:42:45.649 --> 01:42:45.659 align:start position:0%
open the house of the public hearing on
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
House Bill 378 and recognize the prime
 
01:43:16.129 --> 01:43:16.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
we have one
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative Reed we do need a pink
 
01:43:22.209 --> 01:43:22.219 align:start position:0%
car at itself
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sorry no
 
01:43:28.970 --> 01:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh honorable chair and
 
01:43:31.370 --> 01:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee uh
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
from the record my name is Ellen Reed I
 
01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham 10 that's Newmarket
 
01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
in new fields
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
the bill before you today simply
 
01:43:42.890 --> 01:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
requires that a medical provider
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
and form a patient who may have been
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
drugged or assaulted of their existing
 
01:43:50.209 --> 01:43:50.219 align:start position:0%
right to have evidence collected
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
and to restored as part of a state
 
01:43:56.649 --> 01:43:56.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
it does not create a new right that
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
right already exists in 21 colon m
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
I have distributed packets including the
 
01:44:10.609 --> 01:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
current rsas regarding sexual assault
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
victims rights including the right to an
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
examination free of charge actually and
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
the right to have those kits and the
 
01:44:22.729 --> 01:44:22.739 align:start position:0%
evidence and those kits collected
 
01:44:25.729 --> 01:44:25.739 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell the story of the
 
01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
generation of this bill
 
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
on April 29 of last year a woman who
 
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
lives in my town of Newmarket was
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
sexually assaulted by a co-worker she
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
worked at a job that necessitated
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
staying overnight in a bunk house where
 
01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
she had her own room
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
she went to a get-together of co-workers
 
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
after the shift in the community room of
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
the bunkhouse and after consuming a
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
drink that she had made herself
 
01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
she discovered that an identical drink
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
had been placed in front of her while
 
01:44:52.609 --> 01:44:52.619 align:start position:0%
she was not looking she knew that there
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
had only been one individual close
 
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
enough to her and handling the drinks
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
and he confirmed that he made the drink
 
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
trusting her co-workers she began to
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
drink the beverage however she only
 
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
consumed about a third of the drink
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
before she felt groggy and laid her head
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
on the table this was unusual as she
 
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
considers herself experienced in
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
drinking and well-versed and how her
 
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
body responds to drinking
 
01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
she was woken by the sensation of the
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
same co-worker massaging her hand from
 
01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
which she pulled away repeatedly when
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
she lifted her head she realized that
 
01:45:21.890 --> 01:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
all the other co-workers had left and
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
she was alone with this one person
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
she felt ill and stood to go to the
 
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
bathroom but this co-worker grabbed her
 
01:45:29.629 --> 01:45:29.639 align:start position:0%
by the arm and pulled her back into the
 
01:45:31.609 --> 01:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
room to prevent her from leaving
 
01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:33.719 align:start position:0%
she insisted she had to vomit but the
 
01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
co-worker followed her into the single
 
01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
stall bathroom and proceeded to grope
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
her sides and buttocks while she vomited
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
and urinated on herself
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
when she tried to remove his hands he
 
01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
stated don't worry I don't care you're
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
puking I'm paying attention to your ass
 
01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
when she was able to stop vomiting
 
01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
temporarily she pushed him out of the
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
bathroom and closed and locked the door
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
but when she opened the door to leave
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
approximately 15 minutes later he was
 
01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
blocking the door
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
she got past him and ran to her room and
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
managed to close the door in his face
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
and locked herself in the room he
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
continued to text her to try to convince
 
01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
her to let him into the room which she
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
did not do
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
the next morning it was discovered that
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
the co-worker had cleaned all evidence
 
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
of what had happened including using so
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
much soap in the glass of the glass
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
smelled perfumed she was certain she was
 
01:46:20.570 --> 01:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
drugged and she is certain to this day
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
that she was drugged
 
01:46:24.109 --> 01:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
everything I have just told you was
 
01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
testified to in court and found by the
 
01:46:28.609 --> 01:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
judge to be the facts of the case and
 
01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
the basis for a permanent protective
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
order which was issued by the judge
 
01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
the next morning she was still sick and
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
called her husband to take her to
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
Wentworth Douglas hospital to be tested
 
01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
she made it clear to all the health
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
professionals there that she had been
 
01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
assaulted and believed she had been
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
drugged and that she was there to be
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
tested at one point the doctor asked but
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
were you assaulted when you were
 
01:46:49.679 --> 01:46:51.229 align:start position:0%
were you assaulted when you were
assaulted

01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
assaulted
 
01:46:52.970 --> 01:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
indicating that he did not understand
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
the definition of assault
 
01:46:57.530 --> 01:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
the doctor refused to run the state
 
01:46:59.629 --> 01:46:59.639 align:start position:0%
sexual assault kit because the patient
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
had been successful in getting away
 
01:47:04.129 --> 01:47:04.139 align:start position:0%
and protecting herself and so had not
 
01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
been penetrated the doctor only ran
 
01:47:08.450 --> 01:47:08.460 align:start position:0%
tests for illicit recreational drugs
 
01:47:10.669 --> 01:47:10.679 align:start position:0%
like cocaine and methamphetamines which
 
01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
are stimulants that are never used for
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
date rape but do carry a stigma with
 
01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:15.590 align:start position:0%
date rape but do carry a stigma with
them

01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:47:18.290 --> 01:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
to be clear she was not showing any
 
01:47:20.330 --> 01:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
symptoms of using such drugs and was not
 
01:47:21.890 --> 01:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
in medical distress in a way consistent
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
with stimulant use if the woman had
 
01:47:26.209 --> 01:47:26.219 align:start position:0%
happened to be a user of illicit drugs
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
her claims of assault would have been
 
01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
cast into doubt however all of these
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
tests were negative
 
01:47:33.770 --> 01:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
the woman who describes herself as a
 
01:47:35.570 --> 01:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
fighter in a very outspoken and capable
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
very outspoken and capable of advocacy
 
01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
even in a crisis was angry at the
 
01:47:41.689 --> 01:47:41.699 align:start position:0%
doctor's refusal to run the state kit
 
01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
and continued to insist that the doctor
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
run the appropriate tests so much so
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
that the doctor sent in a social worker
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
to calm her down
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
but he did not run the state test in any
 
01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:53.930 align:start position:0%
but he did not run the state test in any
evidence

01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
that could have helped her was lost
 
01:47:58.010 --> 01:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
I have to wonder how many victims have
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
not been nearly so vocal in advocating
 
01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
for themselves as this woman was and
 
01:48:03.890 --> 01:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
went away without ever knowing that they
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
had a right to a state kit
 
01:48:08.689 --> 01:48:08.699 align:start position:0%
further best practice guidelines
 
01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
indicate that medical providers should
 
01:48:13.129 --> 01:48:13.139 align:start position:0%
call in Advocates or sane nurses that
 
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:15.719 align:start position:0%
sexual assault nurse examiners in cases
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
of sexual assault
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
and such Advocates would have known that
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
the woman was entitled to a state kid
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
this is strongly advised but not
 
01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:24.050 align:start position:0%
this is strongly advised but not
mandatory

01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
but because the doctor and none of the
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
nurses or the social worker correctly
 
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
identified either drugging or unwanted
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
sexual contact or attempted rape as
 
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
sexual assault even though they are
 
01:48:40.030 --> 01:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
under our rsas
 
01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
sexual offenses no sane nurse or
 
01:48:45.410 --> 01:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
Advocate was called in
 
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
and here is where I have to explain uh
 
01:48:51.410 --> 01:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
what I have found out in investigating
 
01:48:54.649 --> 01:48:54.659 align:start position:0%
this issue uh there is a difference
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
between the tests that are available to
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals and the tests that are
 
01:49:00.590 --> 01:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
available in the state assault kits we
 
01:49:02.450 --> 01:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
commonly hear about the date rape drugs
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
GHB or Rohypnol or roofies these drugs
 
01:49:07.609 --> 01:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
are famous for erasing victims memory
 
01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
however I learned that they are not even
 
01:49:12.010 --> 01:49:12.020 align:start position:0%
remotely the most common date rape drugs
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
GHB and Rohypnol have the downsides of
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
being illegal and therefore expensive
 
01:49:19.370 --> 01:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
and difficult to obtain and problematic
 
01:49:22.669 --> 01:49:22.679 align:start position:0%
if anyone finds them on a person
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
the most common date rape drugs after
 
01:49:27.649 --> 01:49:27.659 align:start position:0%
alcohol itself are Benadryl and
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter sleep aids which
 
01:49:31.129 --> 01:49:31.139 align:start position:0%
severely exacerbate the effects of
 
01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol but are widely and cheaply
 
01:49:35.209 --> 01:49:35.219 align:start position:0%
available and do not arouse suspicion if
 
01:49:37.129 --> 01:49:37.139 align:start position:0%
someone is seen carrying them
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
these drugs are water soluble and have a
 
01:49:41.689 --> 01:49:41.699 align:start position:0%
short half-life in the body the tests
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
for suspected drugging with these drugs
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
involve testing for very very low levels
 
01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:48.179 align:start position:0%
of a metabolite of a metabolite of
 
01:49:48.179 --> 01:49:50.450 align:start position:0%
of a metabolite of a metabolite of
metabolite

01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
metabolite
 
01:49:52.970 --> 01:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
so there is no medical reason to test
 
01:49:55.129 --> 01:49:55.139 align:start position:0%
for these Trace levels of metabolites
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
only a forensic reason therefore Labs
 
01:50:00.050 --> 01:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
that hospitals have access to do not
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
offer these tests there are only a
 
01:50:05.090 --> 01:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
handful of labs in the country that
 
01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
offer these particular tests for Trace
 
01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
levels of over-the-counter depressants
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
and they are used entirely by State Labs
 
01:50:14.689 --> 01:50:14.699 align:start position:0%
across the country only only a state
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
sexual assault kit has access to these
 
01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:20.209 align:start position:0%
sexual assault kit has access to these
tests

01:50:20.209 --> 01:50:20.219 align:start position:0%
tests
 
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
I contacted the hospital and the woman's
 
01:50:23.689 --> 01:50:23.699 align:start position:0%
behalf and had a conference call with
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
the medical director the medical
 
01:50:27.229 --> 01:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
director claimed that there was a state
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
rule that said that state kids could
 
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
only be run in cases of penetration
 
01:50:34.129 --> 01:50:34.139 align:start position:0%
incredulous I contacted the AG's office
 
01:50:36.770 --> 01:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
Victim Assistance unit the official at
 
01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
the AG's office informed me that not
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
only did no such rule exist but the AG
 
01:50:43.010 --> 01:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
sends out guidance and I found out later
 
01:50:45.169 --> 01:50:45.179 align:start position:0%
it is actually RSA mandated guidance of
 
01:50:46.910 --> 01:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
the AG sends out
 
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
and that is also in your packets two
 
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
medical providers which state the exact
 
01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
opposite of what I was told by the
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
medical director I have distributed the
 
01:50:57.590 --> 01:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
text of some of the texts from the
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
guidance it's quite extensive the
 
01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
guidance asserts among other things that
 
01:51:04.490 --> 01:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
a victim of any sexual offense which
 
01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
includes drugging unwanted sexual
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
contact and attempted felonious or
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
aggravated felonious sexual assault AKA
 
01:51:11.689 --> 01:51:11.699 align:start position:0%
what we would call rape
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
such as the woman in this case is
 
01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
entitled in RSA 21m to a state assault
 
01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:19.860 align:start position:0%
kit being collected and that she cannot
 
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
be denied access to that
 
01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
it also asserts the kit may be collected
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
and samples stored anonymously with
 
01:51:27.649 --> 01:51:27.659 align:start position:0%
instructions on proper storage giving
 
01:51:29.330 --> 01:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
the victim at least 60 days to decide
 
01:51:31.729 --> 01:51:31.739 align:start position:0%
whether to officially report the crime
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
and it furthers asserts that any part of
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
the kit may be collected individually
 
01:51:38.930 --> 01:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
not all elements of the kit need to be
 
01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:40.370 align:start position:0%
not all elements of the kit need to be
submitted

01:51:40.370 --> 01:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
01:51:42.169 --> 01:51:42.179 align:start position:0%
the Victim Assistance official at the
 
01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
AG's office indicated to me repeatedly
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
and emphatically over two separate phone
 
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
calls that despite this AG guidance that
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
is distributed to preventical providers
 
01:51:55.129 --> 01:51:55.139 align:start position:0%
there is an issue of medical medical
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
providers feeling to understand how to
 
01:51:59.570 --> 01:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
correctly submit State kits and that
 
01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
that problem was rampant
 
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
with many doctors not understanding not
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
only the definition of assault but that
 
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
not elements of a kit needs to be
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
submitted for example blood and urine
 
01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
could be submitted without a swab
 
01:52:13.970 --> 01:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
leading to the presumption that if there
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
is no need for a vaginal or other swab
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
that none of the kit can be collected or
 
01:52:25.129 --> 01:52:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:26.350 --> 01:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
um I also
 
01:52:29.330 --> 01:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
contacted a number of organizations that
 
01:52:32.090 --> 01:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
deal with uh Victim Advocacy and had
 
01:52:34.609 --> 01:52:34.619 align:start position:0%
several Zoom calls I explained the
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
situation I'm sad to report that there
 
01:52:38.930 --> 01:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
was some defensiveness some of the
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
participants were either authors of the
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
guidance themselves which the guidance
 
01:52:45.410 --> 01:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
is fine or in charge of the same nurse
 
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
or Advocate programs and they seemed
 
01:52:48.649 --> 01:52:48.659 align:start position:0%
concerned that my desire to make sure
 
01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
that this particular crack that people
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
have been falling through according to
 
01:52:54.970 --> 01:52:54.980 align:start position:0%
the AG
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
meant that I was either imputing the
 
01:52:58.970 --> 01:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
guidance or that I was somehow going to
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
interfere with the sane or Advocate
 
01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
programs they told me they liked things
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
the way they were and I criticized them
 
01:53:06.109 --> 01:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
strongly for not advocating for the
 
01:53:08.209 --> 01:53:08.219 align:start position:0%
victims they claim to defend when I
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
explained that the AG's office indicated
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
this was indeed a systematic problem
 
01:53:13.850 --> 01:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
that kept happening they agreed that the
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
issue needed to be addressed I asked for
 
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
ideas on language but received none from
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
the organizations I believe there may be
 
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
bad feelings left between myself and the
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
organizations that may be preventing a
 
01:53:26.689 --> 01:53:26.699 align:start position:0%
good faith effort resolving this issue
 
01:53:30.609 --> 01:53:30.619 align:start position:0%
so now I will talk about the bill itself
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
because doctors clearly
 
01:53:35.810 --> 01:53:35.820 align:start position:0%
um I'll say doctors meaning providers in
 
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
general clearly are having issues
 
01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
understanding uh what the rights of the
 
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
the patient are that is why this bill is
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
needed it is simple and it is small it
 
01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
is saying that providers will inform
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
victims who are asserting that they may
 
01:53:50.570 --> 01:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
have been drugged or experienced
 
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
unwanted sexual touching or attempted
 
01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:53.510 align:start position:0%
unwanted sexual touching or attempted
assault

01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
assault
 
01:53:55.010 --> 01:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
of their right to have evidence
 
01:53:57.050 --> 01:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
collected either stored or submitted as
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
part of a state kit it simply codifies
 
01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
the core part of the AG guidance
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
so that medical providers can make sure
 
01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
the victim is aware of their legal right
 
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
to a kit in any sexual offense
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
as I said the right already exists in
 
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
21m and the AG has to inform medical
 
01:54:16.189 --> 01:54:16.199 align:start position:0%
providers of victims rights in a guide
 
01:54:19.370 --> 01:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
so RSA says that the victims have this
 
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
right and RSA says the AG's office has
 
01:54:24.890 --> 01:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
to provide information on those victims
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
rights to Medical providers but RSA does
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
not say that the medical providers or
 
01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
really anyone has to inform the victim
 
01:54:34.970 --> 01:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
of their right to a kid and if you've
 
01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
just come out of trauma and you're in
 
01:54:39.410 --> 01:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
the middle of a crisis and you're
 
01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
expected to know what some obscure RSA
 
01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
and fight for that and fight the entire
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
staff at the hospital for that right
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's right I think that
 
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
they should be notified of their rights
 
01:54:53.209 --> 01:54:53.219 align:start position:0%
and the benefit of doing that is that in
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
so doing and making the doctors inform
 
01:54:56.770 --> 01:54:56.780 align:start position:0%
the patients of their inherent right
 
01:54:59.810 --> 01:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
that the doctor then becomes aware of
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
what the rights of the patient are and
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.729 --> 01:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
it's important to note
 
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
that this in no way interferes with the
 
01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:11.639 align:start position:0%
same program or Advocate Program which
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
is not mandatory but rather this better
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
helps providers to call in sane nurses
 
01:55:17.570 --> 01:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
or Advocates by helping doctors
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
correctly identify assault this at least
 
01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
establishes a floor for the medical
 
01:55:25.010 --> 01:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
provider which currently does not exist
 
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
because all law and guidance has
 
01:55:28.370 --> 01:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
presumed that medical providers would
 
01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
have no problem identifying sexual
 
01:55:31.850 --> 01:55:31.860 align:start position:0%
assault and would have no issues
 
01:55:33.709 --> 01:55:33.719 align:start position:0%
administering a state kit when asked
 
01:55:36.109 --> 01:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
that has not been the case
 
01:55:38.090 --> 01:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
no fewer than three ER doctors were
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
consulted on this bill and all of them
 
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
stated this was not problematic
 
01:55:43.490 --> 01:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
requirement so long as notification
 
01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
could be given by a nurse or signed off
 
01:55:47.090 --> 01:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
on by a form which it certainly can
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
there's no language in here that
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
prevents that foreign
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
and then the only thing I will say is
 
01:55:56.990 --> 01:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
I've emailed before is that there was an
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
incorrect title uh put out by OLS from a
 
01:56:01.490 --> 01:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
previous version of the bill the title
 
01:56:03.709 --> 01:56:03.719 align:start position:0%
implies that the medical provider would
 
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
do the storing that is not the normal
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
way of doing things usually medical
 
01:56:09.890 --> 01:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
providers contact law enforcement and
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement does the appropriate
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
storage that is not in the bill it's
 
01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
simply an incorrect title I have also
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
distributed the amendment you don't have
 
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
to adopt the amendment because obviously
 
01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
the title doesn't affect the RSA at all
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to make sure that you had
 
01:56:25.970 --> 01:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
the correct Amendment
 
01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
and I will close by asking the committee
 
01:56:30.649 --> 01:56:30.659 align:start position:0%
to please take this seriously I know a
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
lot of bills in the state house in my
 
01:56:35.209 --> 01:56:35.219 align:start position:0%
six years here I've seen a lot of them
 
01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
get dismissed over
 
01:56:40.490 --> 01:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
small errors or you know no one really
 
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
wanting to work on it
 
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
and and good ideas sometimes fall
 
01:56:47.570 --> 01:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
through but this is a significant Gap in
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
our current system and there's no excuse
 
01:56:52.129 --> 01:56:52.139 align:start position:0%
for this Gap to exist if there is
 
01:56:53.810 --> 01:56:53.820 align:start position:0%
language that the committee this
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee feels that better suits
 
01:56:58.850 --> 01:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
meeting this need I'm happy to help the
 
01:57:00.770 --> 01:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
committee in getting an amendment
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
drafted for example if you feel that a
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
penalty is appropriate or if you feel
 
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
the inclusion of other information
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
beyond the right to a estate kit is
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate but at a bare minimum there
 
01:57:13.129 --> 01:57:13.139 align:start position:0%
needs to be accountability that the
 
01:57:16.609 --> 01:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
provider know what sexual assault is and
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
know if they are violating the existing
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
right that those victims have by denying
 
01:57:23.149 --> 01:57:23.159 align:start position:0%
them a kit and with that all attempt to
 
01:57:24.890 --> 01:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
representative profile yes thank you for
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
your testimony and thank you for taking
 
01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:35.639 align:start position:0%
my question so in the in the Attorney
 
01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
General's guidance there is some
 
01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
considerable content about Anonymous
 
01:57:40.860 --> 01:57:43.850 align:start position:0%
considerable content about Anonymous
kits

01:57:43.850 --> 01:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
kits
 
01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:45.770 align:start position:0%
kits
so

01:57:45.770 --> 01:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:47.689 --> 01:57:47.699 align:start position:0%
understanding that the bill as it is
 
01:57:49.609 --> 01:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
written right now is fairly simple do
 
01:57:51.470 --> 01:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
you think it is appropriate that that
 
01:57:55.209 --> 01:57:55.219 align:start position:0%
notification requirement be extended to
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
include notification that there is also
 
01:58:00.290 --> 01:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
a right to an anonymous kit so if a
 
01:58:01.729 --> 01:58:01.739 align:start position:0%
woman should decide
 
01:58:04.490 --> 01:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
at a later date that that
 
01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:05.629 align:start position:0%
at a later date that that
um

01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:05.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
she wants to pursue
 
01:58:11.689 --> 01:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
criminal charges or an investigation do
 
01:58:12.890 --> 01:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
you think it would be appropriate to add
 
01:58:14.209 --> 01:58:14.219 align:start position:0%
that to the bill or is there any
 
01:58:16.609 --> 01:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
downside to doing that I thank you for
 
01:58:18.169 --> 01:58:18.179 align:start position:0%
the question representative I don't see
 
01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
any downside I considered it but I
 
01:58:22.129 --> 01:58:22.139 align:start position:0%
wanted to keep it as simple as possible
 
01:58:25.250 --> 01:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
to help ensure passage if this committee
 
01:58:27.290 --> 01:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
feels which I think would be totally
 
01:58:29.810 --> 01:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh the to include the
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
information that a victim and I'll say a
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
victim rather than a woman but that a
 
01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:36.189 align:start position:0%
victim rather than a woman but that a
victim

01:58:36.189 --> 01:58:36.199 align:start position:0%
victim
 
01:58:38.689 --> 01:58:38.699 align:start position:0%
may have the dis has the decision
 
01:58:41.570 --> 01:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
already it already exists whether or not
 
01:58:43.729 --> 01:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
to immediately report it through law
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement or to have their evidence
 
01:58:46.729 --> 01:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
collected right then and there because
 
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
if they wait the evidence is gone
 
01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
and they can they through the current
 
01:58:52.490 --> 01:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
procedure as you pointed out they can
 
01:58:54.589 --> 01:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
have their evidence collected and stored
 
01:58:56.810 --> 01:58:56.820 align:start position:0%
at least for 60 days and they can
 
01:58:58.970 --> 01:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
petition to have it stored longer while
 
01:59:00.290 --> 01:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
they make the decision and that's
 
01:59:01.729 --> 01:59:01.739 align:start position:0%
collected anonymously while they make
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
the decision of whether or not to pursue
 
01:59:05.209 --> 01:59:05.219 align:start position:0%
it legally
 
01:59:06.770 --> 01:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
but yes I think it would be appropriate
 
01:59:08.689 --> 01:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
to add it absolutely
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you questions representative King
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald thank you
 
01:59:15.290 --> 01:59:15.300 align:start position:0%
for being here today my apologies I
 
01:59:18.649 --> 01:59:18.659 align:start position:0%
don't have RSA 21-m in front of me but
 
01:59:20.089 --> 01:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Healthcare Providers
 
01:59:22.129 --> 01:59:22.139 align:start position:0%
here is this only in reference to ER
 
01:59:24.410 --> 01:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
doctors or is this also a requirement
 
01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
for all pcps and Specialists and what
 
01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
what is the scope of these Healthcare
 
01:59:32.330 --> 01:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
Providers thank you so the thank you for
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
the question it is all medical providers
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
because we can't say for sure who a
 
01:59:39.890 --> 01:59:39.900 align:start position:0%
victim would report to or go to for
 
01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
assistance but the vast vast majority of
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
providers that this would actually apply
 
01:59:49.370 --> 01:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
to our ER providers so
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
having said that you can't tell a future
 
01:59:53.689 --> 01:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
victim that they only have the right to
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
that notification if they go to the ER
 
01:59:58.010 --> 01:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
and not to their primary or not to an
 
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
urgent care or not to wherever
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
02:00:04.010 --> 02:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:05.209 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

02:00:05.209 --> 02:00:05.219 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
um as a follow-up to this question what
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
would be the penalty for not being aware
 
02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
number one and therefore not providing
 
02:00:18.410 --> 02:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
the option to a victim to have this kid
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
supplied to them
 
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
so there is no penalty in the bill as I
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
said I kept it as minimal as possible to
 
02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
help increase its chances of Passage I
 
02:00:31.250 --> 02:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
would support a penalty there I looked
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
through 21 and there's no penalty for
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
any of the other requirements of medical
 
02:00:36.410 --> 02:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
providers and there are quite a few
 
02:00:37.970 --> 02:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
requirements of medical providers in
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
these cases
 
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
so another follow-up in
 
02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
which I agree with it entirely in its in
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
its premise
 
02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:48.290 align:start position:0%
its premise
um

02:00:48.290 --> 02:00:48.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:51.649 --> 02:00:51.659 align:start position:0%
if you ask all providers to provide the
 
02:00:51.659 --> 02:00:52.729 align:start position:0%
if you ask all providers to provide the
opportunity

02:00:52.729 --> 02:00:52.739 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
um to the victim to have a kid would you
 
02:00:57.410 --> 02:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
be opposed to amending it for the two
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
others who may make direct contact with
 
02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
the victim say law enforcement somebody
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
that they may not go to that you know
 
02:01:07.250 --> 02:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
they may not go to the hospital they may
 
02:01:10.129 --> 02:01:10.139 align:start position:0%
not see a primary care but they may call
 
02:01:11.930 --> 02:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
law enforcement should that be extended
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
to them as well it absolutely could be
 
02:01:16.609 --> 02:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
and and I personally think should be
 
02:01:19.490 --> 02:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
again I I was really shooting for the
 
02:01:22.729 --> 02:01:22.739 align:start position:0%
the lowest bare minimum standard that we
 
02:01:24.530 --> 02:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
should be expecting but I would be happy
 
02:01:26.089 --> 02:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
to extend it to law enforcement if the
 
02:01:27.770 --> 02:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
committee saw fit
 
02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.169 --> 02:01:39.179 align:start position:0%

career I have completed more than a
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
thousand sexual assault medical forensic
 
02:03:21.709 --> 02:03:21.719 align:start position:0%
evaluations and I'm here today to speak
 
02:03:25.070 --> 02:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
in opposition of house bill 378.
 
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
we are sincerely sorry that a negative
 
02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
experience led to this bill okay while
 
02:03:32.089 --> 02:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
we support the overall intention of this
 
02:03:33.890 --> 02:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
legislation to ensure that patients are
 
02:03:36.169 --> 02:03:36.179 align:start position:0%
offered all options available to them we
 
02:03:38.209 --> 02:03:38.219 align:start position:0%
have some significant concerns
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
specifically this bill goes against
 
02:03:41.810 --> 02:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
current practices and protocols already
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
in place in New Hampshire that have been
 
02:03:46.609 --> 02:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
carefully developed over time
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
the first the state of New Hampshire
 
02:03:49.729 --> 02:03:49.739 align:start position:0%
already has a protocol in place for the
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
medical forensic evaluations of sexual
 
02:03:53.330 --> 02:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
assault patients in the health care
 
02:03:56.089 --> 02:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
setting this protocol has existed for
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
several decades and is posted and
 
02:03:59.149 --> 02:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
followed at all New Hampshire hospitals
 
02:04:00.890 --> 02:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers throughout the
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
state are educated on the on the
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
protocol and Best Care processes it puts
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
in place for the care of patients who

02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
the current protocol is written and
 
02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
revised regularly by the

patient's needs currently within the
 
02:04:29.089 --> 02:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
protocol there is already a section
 
02:04:31.129 --> 02:04:31.139 align:start position:0%
specific to drug facilitated sexual
 
02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
assault if a patient presents reporting
 
02:04:34.970 --> 02:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
being drugged and reports that a sexual
 
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
assault did occur or might have occurred
 
02:04:38.450 --> 02:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
there is a process in place which
 
02:04:40.129 --> 02:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
involves collection of blood and or
 
02:04:42.290 --> 02:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
urine samples if the drugging occurred
 
02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
within a specific time frame those
 
02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
samples are then turned over to law
 
02:04:48.649 --> 02:04:48.659 align:start position:0%
enforcement with the jurisdiction for
 
02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
storage preservation and Analysis if
 
02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:51.950 align:start position:0%
storage preservation and Analysis if
appropriate

02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
second if a patient reports a concern
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
that they have been drugged and states
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
there is no chance of sexual assault
 
02:04:59.330 --> 02:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
occurred a sexual assault evidence
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
collection kit would not be warranted
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
because a sexual assault did not occur
 
02:05:05.149 --> 02:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
in those circumstances there would be a
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
discussion between the patient and the
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
medical provider on the medical need for
 
02:05:11.089 --> 02:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
testing if any and if so what drug
 
02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
testing options might be available and
 
02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:14.450 align:start position:0%
testing options might be available and
appropriate

02:05:14.450 --> 02:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
those decisions would be made on a
 
02:05:18.589 --> 02:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis and the medical need
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
of the patient
 
02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
many drugs have limited lifespans and
 
02:05:23.930 --> 02:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
may only be detectable for four hours
 
02:05:26.570 --> 02:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
after ingestion in addition if the
 
02:05:28.609 --> 02:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
patient reports being drugged as a crime
 
02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
to law enforcement there are additional
 
02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
legal processes already in place for the
 
02:05:34.609 --> 02:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies to obtain those
 
02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
samples from the hospital laboratory at
 
02:05:39.050 --> 02:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
their discretion I believe there's other
 
02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
he's here today to testify to that in
 
02:05:43.550 --> 02:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
summary we are in opposition of this
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
bill we believe the protocols already in
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
place serve the needs of sexual assault
 
02:05:49.070 --> 02:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
victims in our states and that patients
 
02:05:50.689 --> 02:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
would like to receive
 
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
who would like to receive blood in urine
 
02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
tests have options available to them
 
02:05:55.850 --> 02:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
already thank you and I'm happy to
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you questions representative
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:06:06.109 --> 02:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh could you tell me
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
the overall situation around sexual
 
02:06:14.330 --> 02:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
assault kid processing in New Hampshire
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
um I heard that in some other areas
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
nationally there's some backlog of
 
02:06:23.930 --> 02:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
processing those kids is there any issue
 
02:06:26.990 --> 02:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
of backlog processing in New Hampshire
 
02:06:30.250 --> 02:06:30.260 align:start position:0%
and do you see this bill
 
02:06:34.430 --> 02:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
might create or make it worse if it will
 
02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
be more kids
 
02:06:40.010 --> 02:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
distributed and need to process them do
 
02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:46.070 --> 02:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
I believe they're individuals here from
 
02:06:47.450 --> 02:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety who might be
 
02:06:49.010 --> 02:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
more appropriate to respond to that
 
02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
question if you'd like to hold it
 
02:06:52.010 --> 02:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
representative does that make sense
 
02:06:53.689 --> 02:06:53.699 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:06:56.450 --> 02:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
other questions representative pushman
 
02:06:58.250 --> 02:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:07:00.109 --> 02:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
um can you share with the committee what
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%
um in in your protocol what the
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
definition of sexual assault is does it
 
02:07:09.770 --> 02:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
only include penetration Does it include
 
02:07:13.129 --> 02:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
unwanted touching and Does it include
 
02:07:13.139 --> 02:07:15.470 align:start position:0%
unwanted touching and Does it include
drugging

02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
drugging
 
02:07:17.629 --> 02:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
so I believe that question would be best
 
02:07:21.290 --> 02:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
for the legal folks within our our
 
02:07:22.850 --> 02:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
programs but
 
02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:23.930 align:start position:0%
programs but
um

02:07:23.930 --> 02:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:26.450 --> 02:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
there are several definitions within the
 
02:07:26.460 --> 02:07:27.890 align:start position:0%
there are several definitions within the
protocol

02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
protocol
 
02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:29.209 align:start position:0%
protocol
um

02:07:29.209 --> 02:07:29.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:31.729 --> 02:07:31.739 align:start position:0%
and they reference other statutes in the
 
02:07:31.739 --> 02:07:34.010 align:start position:0%
and they reference other statutes in the
state

02:07:34.010 --> 02:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:35.810 --> 02:07:35.820 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:07:38.089 --> 02:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
thank you would you be able to provide
 
02:07:40.010 --> 02:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
the committee with um like a digital
 
02:07:42.649 --> 02:07:42.659 align:start position:0%
copy copy of that protocol and Bill of
 
02:07:44.810 --> 02:07:44.820 align:start position:0%
Rights that you mentioned
 
02:07:47.209 --> 02:07:47.219 align:start position:0%
thank God absolutely thank you
 
02:07:49.010 --> 02:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:07:53.149 --> 02:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
both for being here would you include in
 
02:07:54.770 --> 02:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
the definition of sexual assault
 
02:08:00.649 --> 02:08:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:03.410 --> 02:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
again that would be for uh legal folks
 
02:08:05.570 --> 02:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
sorry I was just trying to do that
 
02:08:07.490 --> 02:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
because that is on the domestic violence
 
02:08:10.729 --> 02:08:10.739 align:start position:0%
Coalition website as the definition and
 
02:08:12.830 --> 02:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about that mismatch if those
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
are not treated with this level of
 
02:08:16.679 --> 02:08:19.669 align:start position:0%
are not treated with this level of
severity

02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mask a
 
02:08:22.490 --> 02:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
clarifying question it seems like the
 
02:08:24.169 --> 02:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
questions that you all are asking right
 
02:08:25.850 --> 02:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
now is whether or not evidence would be
 
02:08:28.609 --> 02:08:28.619 align:start position:0%
collected if a patient presented saying
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
they'd been sexually assaulted but it
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
was not a penetration crime is that
 
02:08:34.970 --> 02:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
that is 100 correct so Janet do you want
 
02:08:36.530 --> 02:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
to speak to the what the response would
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
be yeah um so generally if a sexual
 
02:08:43.129 --> 02:08:43.139 align:start position:0%
assault evidence collection kit would be
 
02:08:44.990 --> 02:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
collected if we suspected somebody
 
02:08:47.209 --> 02:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
else's DNA on their bodies were their
 
02:08:50.209 --> 02:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
acts occurred that that led to that
 
02:08:50.219 --> 02:08:51.530 align:start position:0%
acts occurred that that led to that
um

02:08:51.530 --> 02:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:55.310 --> 02:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of a drugging
 
02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:56.689 align:start position:0%
in terms of a drugging
um

02:08:56.689 --> 02:08:56.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:58.729 --> 02:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't necessarily call someone in
 
02:09:01.609 --> 02:09:01.619 align:start position:0%
for an Evidence collection kit
 
02:09:04.070 --> 02:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
um without other acts that have occurred
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
we don't know what that potential
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
drugging might have been for and that
 
02:09:12.830 --> 02:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:16.010 --> 02:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
I think I can add a clarifying um piece
 
02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
of information if someone presented an
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
emergency room with injuries and perhaps
 
02:09:21.169 --> 02:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
they had been bitten on their breasts or
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
their buttocks and there's a possibility
 
02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
that there could be saliva that would be
 
02:09:26.089 --> 02:09:26.099 align:start position:0%
collected absolutely that evidence would
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
have been collected and it would have
 
02:09:29.209 --> 02:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
been treated as a sexual assault for
 
02:09:32.570 --> 02:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up sorry and then as a follow-up
 
02:09:37.129 --> 02:09:37.139 align:start position:0%
so if a woman is a woman or a man is
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
successful in defeating the attempted
 
02:09:41.570 --> 02:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
rape and there's no DNA transferred you
 
02:09:42.890 --> 02:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
believe it do you believe it's
 
02:09:44.930 --> 02:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to collect blood and urine
 
02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:48.589 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to collect blood and urine
samples

02:09:48.589 --> 02:09:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:51.229 --> 02:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
could you repeat that I'm sorry thank
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
you if a man or a woman is successful in
 
02:09:57.229 --> 02:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
stopping an attempted rape so that there
 
02:09:59.570 --> 02:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
is not a DNA transfer do you think that
 
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
it is inappropriate use of resources to
 
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't feel that it would be
 
02:10:11.089 --> 02:10:11.099 align:start position:0%
appropriate to collect those at that
 
02:10:11.099 --> 02:10:12.050 align:start position:0%
appropriate to collect those at that
time

02:10:12.050 --> 02:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:10:13.850 --> 02:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:16.370 --> 02:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:10:18.850 --> 02:10:18.860 align:start position:0%

02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.490 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

02:10:22.490 --> 02:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:10:24.290 --> 02:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
um so I read through your testimony and
 
02:10:26.229 --> 02:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
I noticed in there that it said this
 
02:10:29.330 --> 02:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
legislation if passed would result in
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
several unintended consequences can you
 
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit on what those
 
02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:40.260 --> 02:10:43.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.810 --> 02:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
in terms of unintended consequences a
 
02:10:53.570 --> 02:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
lot of people would think that a blutter
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
urine test is the end-all be-all
 
02:10:56.639 --> 02:10:57.530 align:start position:0%
urine test is the end-all be-all
um

02:10:57.530 --> 02:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
not necessarily they have a half-life of
 
02:11:02.270 --> 02:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
some we have a half-life of four hours
 
02:11:04.490 --> 02:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
or in are in and out of the system that
 
02:11:06.410 --> 02:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
quickly if the urine sample is not
 
02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:09.599 align:start position:0%
placed on Ice would there be a chain of
 
02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
custody issue possibly
 
02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:13.010 align:start position:0%
custody issue possibly
um

02:11:13.010 --> 02:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:15.169 --> 02:11:15.179 align:start position:0%
sometimes they will have false negatives
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
come back several states do not even
 
02:11:19.790 --> 02:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
test for drug facilitated sexual assault
 
02:11:21.530 --> 02:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
as part of their evidence collection kit
 
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
because they would provide you know
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
false sense of security that something
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
didn't happen or that something may have
 
02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:30.410 align:start position:0%
didn't happen or that something may have
happened

02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
happened
 
02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:31.430 align:start position:0%
happened
um

02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
often they will go based on the signs
 
02:11:34.970 --> 02:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
and symptoms that that person
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
experienced during or or with the
 
02:11:40.430 --> 02:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
complete lack of injury I mean complete
 
02:11:44.570 --> 02:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:45.410 --> 02:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:11:47.570 --> 02:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative another concern that we
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
have is this bill would mandate every
 
02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
medical provider to offer a test to
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
anyone who presents for any of these
 
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
crimes the victim has a choice to turn
 
02:11:58.970 --> 02:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
that down our concern would be if a
 
02:12:00.649 --> 02:12:00.659 align:start position:0%
victim didn't want to be tested for one
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
reason or another perhaps they're
 
02:12:03.530 --> 02:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
underage and they've been drinking
 
02:12:05.089 --> 02:12:05.099 align:start position:0%
perhaps they did use an illegal
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
substance that they're declining the
 
02:12:09.050 --> 02:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
test would actually be used against them
 
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
in the prosecution of their case so this
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
is an overbroad mandate by a long shot
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of who medical providers would
 
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:18.599 align:start position:0%
be required to notify
 
02:12:20.450 --> 02:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
that's very helpful thank you
 
02:12:22.669 --> 02:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lanza
 
02:12:24.530 --> 02:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh would all
 
02:12:28.189 --> 02:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
um providers be educated in regards to
 
02:12:30.109 --> 02:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
this process of what they need to do
 
02:12:33.169 --> 02:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
when a victim of assault has come into
 
02:12:35.689 --> 02:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
their office
 
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk about the internet
 
02:12:41.149 --> 02:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
um The Physicians Advanced providers and
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
what have you when they go through like
 
02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
part of their orientation process at the
 
02:12:47.089 --> 02:12:47.099 align:start position:0%
hospital would be to include going over
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
what would occur if this partic you know
 
02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
if a particular patient presented with
 
02:12:53.810 --> 02:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
this specific Chief complaint
 
02:12:56.689 --> 02:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
can I follow up follow up and would um
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
where would they have those kits within
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
their offices in order to
 
02:13:06.169 --> 02:13:06.179 align:start position:0%
um you know get the samples yep so um
 
02:13:08.569 --> 02:13:08.579 align:start position:0%
specifically these uh the sexual assault
 
02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
evidence collection kits are kept in
 
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
emergency departments in the state of
 
02:13:13.850 --> 02:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so if a patient presented
 
02:13:16.250 --> 02:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
to an office clinic or to an urgent care
 
02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
or some other setting than the emergency
 
02:13:20.990 --> 02:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
department they are then you know given
 
02:13:22.370 --> 02:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
a warm handoff to the emergency
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you um and
 
02:13:31.550 --> 02:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um just
 
02:13:32.930 --> 02:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
a question how long have these kits been
 
02:13:35.930 --> 02:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
available and do they change in time as
 
02:13:37.669 --> 02:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
far as what's in the kit
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
02:13:41.810 --> 02:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
um so oh gosh the first kit was in the
 
02:13:43.790 --> 02:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
90s when it was developed we're in the
 
02:13:45.770 --> 02:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
9000 Series kit
 
02:13:48.050 --> 02:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
um with each one thousand kits we go
 
02:13:50.569 --> 02:13:50.579 align:start position:0%
through with a multi-disciplinary team
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
that includes you know law enforcement
 
02:13:57.470 --> 02:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
medical providers advocacy crime lab
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
personnel and what have you and they go
 
02:14:01.750 --> 02:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
through what is the next best
 
02:14:03.470 --> 02:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice
 
02:14:05.569 --> 02:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
and that's how these are developed and
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
changed each time
 
02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:11.089 --> 02:14:11.099 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you chairman
 
02:14:12.410 --> 02:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you for taking questions
 
02:14:15.410 --> 02:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
I can understand the um apprehension
 
02:14:17.089 --> 02:14:17.099 align:start position:0%
with requiring every medical
 
02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
professional professional to do
 
02:14:21.050 --> 02:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
something that maybe is
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
just Overkill but you know as a as a
 
02:14:26.930 --> 02:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
victim there's got to be somewhere a
 
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
person can go to collect as much
 
02:14:31.250 --> 02:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
evidence as possible for a future legal
 
02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
action I mean it would be it just seems
 
02:14:35.089 --> 02:14:35.099 align:start position:0%
devastating the idea that somebody could
 
02:14:36.830 --> 02:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
fall through this the cracks like that
 
02:14:39.169 --> 02:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
where would a person go right now if
 
02:14:41.149 --> 02:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
they said no I'm getting this this test
 
02:14:43.370 --> 02:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
done now I don't care what anybody else
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
says I want it now where would they go
 
02:14:49.250 --> 02:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
if not the ER or somewhere else so
 
02:14:51.709 --> 02:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
um I believe our partners will talk to a
 
02:14:54.530 --> 02:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
regarding that those exact same tests
 
02:14:56.450 --> 02:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
that would be collected as part of like
 
02:14:59.629 --> 02:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
the kit law enforcement could also do
 
02:15:01.850 --> 02:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
that as well but they'll they'll talk
 
02:15:03.649 --> 02:15:03.659 align:start position:0%
about all that
 
02:15:03.659 --> 02:15:04.430 align:start position:0%
about all that
um

02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:07.129 --> 02:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
hospitals also have other means yes they
 
02:15:09.649 --> 02:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
have the general toxicology panel
 
02:15:09.659 --> 02:15:10.370 align:start position:0%
have the general toxicology panel
um

02:15:10.370 --> 02:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
some places will also do hair toxicology
 
02:15:14.569 --> 02:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
if it's been greater than three weeks
 
02:15:17.149 --> 02:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
since the time of the ingestion some
 
02:15:18.770 --> 02:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
places will send out what's called a
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
headed sedative hypnotic panel each
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hospital does have additional testing
 
02:15:26.450 --> 02:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
that they are able to complete if they
 
02:15:27.709 --> 02:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
feel it's appropriate in the medical
 
02:15:27.719 --> 02:15:29.569 align:start position:0%
feel it's appropriate in the medical
need

02:15:29.569 --> 02:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:15:32.450 --> 02:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
but follow up by the way but you're
 
02:15:34.250 --> 02:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
still dependent on somebody else giving
 
02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
you permission to take that test I mean
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
there's got to be somewhere a victim to
 
02:15:39.890 --> 02:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
go without anybody else's permission in
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
the entire world to take that test I
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
mean so is there right now or or do you
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
still at this day need permission from
 
02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
somebody else to get that test thank you
 
02:15:54.050 --> 02:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:56.030 --> 02:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
um and again if it warranted they could
 
02:15:59.089 --> 02:15:59.099 align:start position:0%
do this as part of a kit otherwise law
 
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement could potentially as well
 
02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
um have that that testing done
 
02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:06.109 align:start position:0%
um have that that testing done
um

02:16:06.109 --> 02:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:10.189 --> 02:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise I'm unaware at dhmc we do a
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
sedative hypnotic panel which does
 
02:16:14.450 --> 02:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
include Rohypnol GHB and several other
 
02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:17.149 align:start position:0%
include Rohypnol GHB and several other
drugs

02:16:17.149 --> 02:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:22.490 --> 02:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative Freitas yes I have a
 
02:16:24.290 --> 02:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
question can I purchase one of those
 
02:16:29.209 --> 02:16:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
02:16:33.650 --> 02:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here and
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question does that sedative
 
02:16:39.849 --> 02:16:39.859 align:start position:0%
hypnotic panel typically also check for
 
02:16:43.549 --> 02:16:43.559 align:start position:0%
Benadryl metabolites or no it does not

never done anything like this and this
 
02:17:40.370 --> 02:17:40.380 align:start position:0%

02:17:47.929 --> 02:17:47.939 align:start position:0%
when I saw this bill when
 
02:17:47.939 --> 02:17:49.310 align:start position:0%
when I saw this bill when
um

02:17:49.310 --> 02:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:51.290 --> 02:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:17:55.129 --> 02:17:55.139 align:start position:0%
I can't think of when this
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:01.389 --> 02:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
um when I saw this bill and talked to
 
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
Leanne and about this it really struck a
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
chord with me
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
um I am
 
02:18:11.629 --> 02:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire right through and
 
02:18:14.990 --> 02:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
through I was born here lived here my
 
02:18:16.730 --> 02:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
whole life and even after college when I
 
02:18:18.709 --> 02:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
met my husband from New York I made him
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
move here to be in New Hampshire you
 
02:18:24.410 --> 02:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
know the Live Free or Die State
 
02:18:24.420 --> 02:18:25.370 align:start position:0%
know the Live Free or Die State
um

02:18:25.370 --> 02:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:27.599 align:start position:0%
when I see a bill like this coming up
 
02:18:30.910 --> 02:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
because somebody has a personal
 
02:18:33.349 --> 02:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
experience that was so awful that they
 
02:18:35.150 --> 02:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
felt like they needed to bring it up to
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
this level of you know people who can
 
02:18:40.730 --> 02:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
help you because the people who should
 
02:18:43.370 --> 02:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
be helping you or not I think is just a
 
02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
little bit crazy
 
02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:46.070 align:start position:0%
little bit crazy
um

02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:48.889 --> 02:18:48.899 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill to me
 
02:18:52.310 --> 02:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
screams you're just
 
02:18:55.610 --> 02:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
here to protect rapists to protect
 
02:18:57.410 --> 02:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
pedophiles to protect the people
 
02:18:59.929 --> 02:18:59.939 align:start position:0%
committing these crimes and not helping
 
02:19:02.830 --> 02:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
these actual victims because what woman
 
02:19:05.690 --> 02:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
wants to come in somewhere
 
02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:06.770 align:start position:0%
wants to come in somewhere
she's

02:19:06.770 --> 02:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
she's
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
all shaken up she has no idea what's
 
02:19:10.610 --> 02:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
happening like she wants to throw up
 
02:19:15.650 --> 02:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:17.690 --> 02:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
people want to make
 
02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:19.070 align:start position:0%
people want to make
them

02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:20.990 align:start position:0%
them
bit

02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:19:24.589 --> 02:19:24.599 align:start position:0%
these incredibly specific criteria when
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
this is a human being this is most
 
02:19:29.929 --> 02:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
likely a teenage girl you know a young
 
02:19:29.939 --> 02:19:30.790 align:start position:0%
likely a teenage girl you know a young
adult

02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
adult
 
02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
that has no idea what to do has never
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
been to a hospital without her parents
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
ever and now she's in the situation
 
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
where she's seeking help for the crisis
 
02:19:44.929 --> 02:19:44.939 align:start position:0%
that now she's experiencing and
 
02:19:46.849 --> 02:19:46.859 align:start position:0%
on the other side of it
 
02:19:49.969 --> 02:19:49.979 align:start position:0%
she could get pushed back saying well we
 
02:19:51.469 --> 02:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
don't think what happened to you was an
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
actual assault
 
02:19:57.170 --> 02:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
and the Damage that can do to a person
 
02:19:58.250 --> 02:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you've seen the
 
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
statistics lately
 
02:20:02.450 --> 02:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
The Washington Post just
 
02:20:05.570 --> 02:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
um posted this crazy statistic saying
 
02:20:09.410 --> 02:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
American Girls in high school right now
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
one in three have seriously considered
 
02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:14.090 align:start position:0%
one in three have seriously considered
suicide

02:20:14.090 --> 02:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
02:20:17.810 --> 02:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
that's insane to me like these girls are
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
getting to a point where they would
 
02:20:25.070 --> 02:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
rather kill themselves than
 
02:20:28.250 --> 02:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
try to keep going in this society that
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
literally is giving us nothing we're
 
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
losing women are losing everything and
 
02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:33.650 align:start position:0%
losing women are losing everything and
now

02:20:33.650 --> 02:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:20:35.929 --> 02:20:35.939 align:start position:0%
a simple Bill like this like hey can we
 
02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
get more rape kits and more places and
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
make sure it's easier for these victims
 
02:20:42.530 --> 02:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
to to get these sort of things so they
 
02:20:46.370 --> 02:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
can pursue Justice if they want to for
 
02:20:48.650 --> 02:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
them to begin the healing Journey that
 
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely is going to take years for
 
02:20:53.570 --> 02:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
them to recover from
 
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
um I feel like those essential moments
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
when a woman comes in and needs help and
 
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
mayor said something like that's not
 
02:21:03.290 --> 02:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
protocol for what you've experienced
 
02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:05.630 align:start position:0%
protocol for what you've experienced
like

02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:21:08.210 --> 02:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
how can you be a human being
 
02:21:13.309 --> 02:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
and think that not every single person
 
02:21:16.010 --> 02:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
who's experiencing some sort of sexual
 
02:21:16.020 --> 02:21:17.210 align:start position:0%
who's experiencing some sort of sexual
assault

02:21:17.210 --> 02:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
assault
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
should have access to the testing and
 
02:21:23.389 --> 02:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
the health care that they think they
 
02:21:26.030 --> 02:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
need in order to heal and move forward
 
02:21:28.130 --> 02:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:21:28.140 --> 02:21:29.750 align:start position:0%
with this
um

02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:32.570 --> 02:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
that's all I can think of I mean I you
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
know it just really scares me
 
02:21:37.969 --> 02:21:37.979 align:start position:0%
I don't know a single woman who has not
 
02:21:40.190 --> 02:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
encountered some sort of sexual
 
02:21:45.530 --> 02:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
harassment or abuse I'm a childhood
 
02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:46.550 align:start position:0%
harassment or abuse I'm a childhood
um

02:21:46.550 --> 02:21:46.560 align:start position:0%

02:21:53.929 --> 02:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
assault and I'm 35 now and literally to
 
02:21:55.309 --> 02:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
this day
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
nobody knows because I didn't know who
 
02:22:01.610 --> 02:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
to tell I didn't know what to do
 
02:22:04.429 --> 02:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
as I got older I saw that it's not just
 
02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
me experiencing these scary ordeals and
 
02:22:09.950 --> 02:22:09.960 align:start position:0%

02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:55.429 align:start position:0%
which I am
um

02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's very important to provide
 
02:24:01.790 --> 02:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
them to any sexual assault Survivor
 
02:24:04.429 --> 02:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
um every 68 seconds an American is
 
02:24:06.410 --> 02:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
sexually assaulted every nine minutes
 
02:24:09.170 --> 02:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
that victim is a child one in six women
 
02:24:11.210 --> 02:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
have experienced at least one sexual
 
02:24:13.130 --> 02:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
assault in their lifetime
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
one in 33 men will as well
 
02:24:18.530 --> 02:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
these statistics are just those that are
 
02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:20.150 align:start position:0%
these statistics are just those that are
reported

02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
reported
 
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
according I just wanted to clear up when
 
02:24:25.849 --> 02:24:25.859 align:start position:0%
in listening to the women who were
 
02:24:28.190 --> 02:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
opposed of this bill and there was some
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
question as to what sexual assault is
 
02:24:33.889 --> 02:24:33.899 align:start position:0%
defined as I did a quick Google search
 
02:24:33.899 --> 02:24:34.670 align:start position:0%
defined as I did a quick Google search
um

02:24:34.670 --> 02:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:37.010 --> 02:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
because I have an idea
 
02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:39.180 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to make sure I got it right
 
02:24:42.530 --> 02:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
According to rain.org which is the rape
 
02:24:45.530 --> 02:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
abuse and incest national network the
 
02:24:47.630 --> 02:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
term sexual assault refers to the sexual
 
02:24:49.490 --> 02:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
contact or behavior that occurs without
 
02:24:52.490 --> 02:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
explicit consent of the victim
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
some forms of sexual assault include
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
attempted rape fondling or unwanted
 
02:24:59.929 --> 02:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
sexual touching forcing a victim to
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
perform sexual acts such as oral sex or
 
02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
penetrating the perpetrator's body
 
02:25:07.010 --> 02:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
penetration of the victim's body also
 
02:25:09.290 --> 02:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
known as rape
 
02:25:12.530 --> 02:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
only 25 of every 1000 Predators will end
 
02:25:15.290 --> 02:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
up serving time in prison DNA evidence
 
02:25:17.090 --> 02:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
can increase the likelihood of holding
 
02:25:18.889 --> 02:25:18.899 align:start position:0%
perpetrators accountable and prevent
 
02:25:21.710 --> 02:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
other attacks rate kits provide this
 
02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:24.050 align:start position:0%
other attacks rate kits provide this
evidence

02:25:24.050 --> 02:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:27.730 --> 02:25:27.740 align:start position:0%
rape kits gather clothing fibers hair
 
02:25:30.110 --> 02:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
bodily fluids that could be used to
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
convict these perpetrators and bodily
 
02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:33.050 align:start position:0%
convict these perpetrators and bodily
fluids

02:25:33.050 --> 02:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
fluids
 
02:25:35.929 --> 02:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
survivors who endure the intrusive and
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
extensive steps to have DNA evidence
 
02:25:40.790 --> 02:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
stored to be tested which can take about
 
02:25:44.210 --> 02:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:44.220 --> 02:25:47.090 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:25:47.090 --> 02:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:50.330 --> 02:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
sorry identify unknown performing these
 
02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
rape kits help to identify unknown
 
02:25:56.510 --> 02:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
assailants solve crimes reveal serial
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
offenders and exonerate wrongfully
 
02:26:02.410 --> 02:26:02.420 align:start position:0%
convicted in unveiling criminal patterns
 
02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
statistically assailants
 
02:26:08.450 --> 02:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
it is not their first time and it will
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
not be their first time
 
02:26:13.010 --> 02:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
so if we can prevent that I don't
 
02:26:17.270 --> 02:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
understand why we would try to stop that
 
02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:18.410 align:start position:0%
understand why we would try to stop that
um

02:26:18.410 --> 02:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:22.370 --> 02:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
in a fun little fact that I found on the
 
02:26:22.380 --> 02:26:26.270 align:start position:0%
in a fun little fact that I found on the
endthebacklog.org

02:26:26.270 --> 02:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:28.849 --> 02:26:28.859 align:start position:0%
was in addition to increasing safety
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
communities save money by testing and
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
providing kits and Prosecuting offenders
 
02:26:36.410 --> 02:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
in Cuyahoga County Ohio officials tested
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
over 7 000 backlogged kits investigated
 
02:26:41.809 --> 02:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
every lead engaged survivors in
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
prosecuted cases through this testing
 
02:26:45.889 --> 02:26:45.899 align:start position:0%
serial criminals were taken off the
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
streets and future crimes were averted
 
02:26:49.969 --> 02:26:49.979 align:start position:0%
saving the county an estimated 38
 
02:26:52.130 --> 02:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
million dollars you could begin wrapping
 
02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
up ma'am please sure if you take a look
 
02:26:56.510 --> 02:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
around the room as I mentioned before at
 
02:26:57.950 --> 02:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
least one in six women here have
 
02:26:59.270 --> 02:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
experienced sexual assault in their
 
02:27:01.849 --> 02:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
lifetime 33 men have as well and every
 
02:27:03.710 --> 02:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
nine minutes one of those victims is a
 
02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
child every single one of these victims
 
02:27:07.370 --> 02:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
deserve to have tests readily available
 
02:27:09.170 --> 02:27:09.180 align:start position:0%
to provide at least any semblance of
 
02:27:12.889 --> 02:27:12.899 align:start position:0%
safety after such a traumatic experience
 
02:27:16.429 --> 02:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
um just a quick note I am a survivor of
 
02:27:19.370 --> 02:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and I
 
02:27:23.270 --> 02:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
was not given the opportunity to
 
02:27:26.330 --> 02:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
have a rape kit performed
 
02:27:29.809 --> 02:27:29.819 align:start position:0%
and I wish more than anything that I
 
02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
could have because
 
02:27:37.849 --> 02:27:37.859 align:start position:0%
as I am learning from other individuals
 
02:27:40.730 --> 02:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
who have also been victims of my
 
02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:42.889 align:start position:0%
who have also been victims of my
assailant

02:27:42.889 --> 02:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
assailant
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
what if a rape kit could have stopped
 
02:27:47.330 --> 02:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
him and prevented the so far six other
 
02:27:51.050 --> 02:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
victims of this perpetrator
 
02:27:53.929 --> 02:27:53.939 align:start position:0%
um I just I it's very important to the
 
02:27:57.710 --> 02:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
safety of the community and yeah
 
02:28:02.330 --> 02:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay no questions thank you very much
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:12.770 --> 02:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Michelle
 
02:28:12.780 --> 02:28:23.750 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Michelle
Sanborn

02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
02:28:29.570 --> 02:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing this bill and um
 
02:28:31.610 --> 02:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
yeah considering
 
02:28:34.670 --> 02:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
the significance of the implication of
 
02:28:36.410 --> 02:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
what this great minutes ma'am if you can
 
02:28:39.530 --> 02:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
simple bill will accomplish thank you my
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
name is Michelle Sanborn I'm from
 
02:28:43.070 --> 02:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
Belmont New Hampshire
 
02:28:44.990 --> 02:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
um in my 20s I was a victim of sexual
 
02:28:47.690 --> 02:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
assault I'm now in my 50s
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
that experience never leaves you was I
 
02:28:51.889 --> 02:28:51.899 align:start position:0%
raped no
 
02:28:55.309 --> 02:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
so would a rape Kip do me any good no
 
02:28:57.770 --> 02:28:57.780 align:start position:0%
would the expanded what I would consider
 
02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
and this is my verbiage understanding of
 
02:29:04.370 --> 02:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
this is more of a toxicology report
 
02:29:06.530 --> 02:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
versus an actual rape kid that is
 
02:29:08.929 --> 02:29:08.939 align:start position:0%
looking for DNA this would have helped
 
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
me I wasn't bit on the buttocks I wasn't
 
02:29:14.270 --> 02:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
bit on the breast there was no DNA
 
02:29:16.490 --> 02:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
transfer it doesn't mean that my
 
02:29:18.410 --> 02:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
experience was any less
 
02:29:21.170 --> 02:29:21.180 align:start position:0%
significant than any other woman or
 
02:29:21.180 --> 02:29:23.450 align:start position:0%
significant than any other woman or
person

02:29:23.450 --> 02:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:29:23.460 --> 02:29:24.469 align:start position:0%
person
um

02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:26.929 --> 02:29:26.939 align:start position:0%
I heard earlier from and I don't know
 
02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
the exact name of the organization but
 
02:29:32.530 --> 02:29:32.540 align:start position:0%
domestic violence organization
 
02:29:36.349 --> 02:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
that this would mandate collection of
 
02:29:38.990 --> 02:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
samples that could incriminate a victim
 
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:40.690 align:start position:0%
samples that could incriminate a victim
potentially

02:29:40.690 --> 02:29:40.700 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
the way I read this it says requiring a
 
02:29:47.330 --> 02:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
health care provider to inform and offer
 
02:29:51.710 --> 02:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't force a victim to do anything
 
02:29:54.050 --> 02:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
it doesn't force a health care provider
 
02:29:57.469 --> 02:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
to do anything other than inform and
 
02:30:01.130 --> 02:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
offer leaving the choice to the victim
 
02:30:03.889 --> 02:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
I wanted to clarify that
 
02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
if I had had the choice I would have
 
02:30:09.770 --> 02:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
opted for this kind of testing
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
I didn't have that choice
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
I have a 23 year old daughter who
 
02:30:17.270 --> 02:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
currently could be in a position where
 
02:30:19.490 --> 02:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
she may not have that choice
 
02:30:21.530 --> 02:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
I've been to a number of Health Care
 
02:30:24.429 --> 02:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
providers in my life many of us have
 
02:30:27.349 --> 02:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
that have often not been willing to
 
02:30:30.050 --> 02:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
perform procedures
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
that I was interested in learning more
 
02:30:34.490 --> 02:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
about didn't mean I was going to jump in
 
02:30:36.349 --> 02:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
and do it it meant I wanted more
 
02:30:36.359 --> 02:30:37.910 align:start position:0%
and do it it meant I wanted more
information

02:30:37.910 --> 02:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:30:39.770 --> 02:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
and they were unwilling to provide that
 
02:30:41.809 --> 02:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
information on something that wasn't
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
even this significant
 
02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
so we look to our health care providers
 
02:30:50.330 --> 02:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
as symbols of authority
 
02:30:52.250 --> 02:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
that's the structure of our culture and
 
02:30:53.870 --> 02:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
our society and what we're conditioned
 
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
and trained to believe like teachers and
 
02:30:58.250 --> 02:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
and police officers
 
02:31:00.290 --> 02:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
so if a healthcare provider doesn't
 
02:31:03.889 --> 02:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
believe that it's warranted that person
 
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
will never receive the information or
 
02:31:08.690 --> 02:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
they'll run up against resistance and a
 
02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
rejection a denial
 
02:31:13.610 --> 02:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
that's not a right
 
02:31:18.650 --> 02:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
human Humane if you will
 
02:31:24.050 --> 02:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
people should at least have the right to
 
02:31:26.929 --> 02:31:26.939 align:start position:0%
be informed and in my view that's what
 
02:31:28.370 --> 02:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
this bill is accomplishing it's not me
 
02:31:30.710 --> 02:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
and dating anything other than
 
02:31:33.770 --> 02:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
those that we look to in Authority as
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
protection figures are mandated to at
 
02:31:39.410 --> 02:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
least offer and inform
 
02:31:40.969 --> 02:31:40.979 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the very least that
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
could be done
 
02:31:45.050 --> 02:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
I'm open to questions thank you
 
02:31:45.060 --> 02:31:47.870 align:start position:0%
I'm open to questions thank you
questions

02:31:47.870 --> 02:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:50.150 --> 02:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
see no questions okay thank you ma'am
 
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Alex Lee from
 
02:32:08.469 --> 02:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:10.910 --> 02:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning Mr chairman
 
02:32:12.349 --> 02:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
02:32:13.790 --> 02:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
again if you could keep your testimony
 
02:32:16.010 --> 02:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
around three minutes yes sir my name is
 
02:32:18.290 --> 02:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
Alex Lee I'm the chief of police in
 
02:32:20.990 --> 02:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
Newport until about three weeks ago I
 
02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
was a specialized sexual assault
 
02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
investigator for the last 19 years
 
02:32:28.370 --> 02:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
I come before you this morning I support
 
02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
the intention behind this bill but I
 
02:32:32.809 --> 02:32:32.819 align:start position:0%
have serious concerns and I have to
 
02:32:35.330 --> 02:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
oppose the specific language related to
 
02:32:38.570 --> 02:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
toxicology samples and the reason why is
 
02:32:40.250 --> 02:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
because I believe that the language of
 
02:32:43.070 --> 02:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
this bill will have serious unintended
 
02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:44.690 align:start position:0%
this bill will have serious unintended
consequences

02:32:44.690 --> 02:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
02:32:46.969 --> 02:32:46.979 align:start position:0%
sexual assault is a crime and the
 
02:32:49.130 --> 02:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
investigation of sexual assault is very
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
complex in these cases law enforcement
 
02:32:55.429 --> 02:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
and prosecution has to discuss together
 
02:32:58.849 --> 02:32:58.859 align:start position:0%
and decide together what evidence should
 
02:33:00.889 --> 02:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
and should not be collected what
 
02:33:03.250 --> 02:33:03.260 align:start position:0%
evidence will or will not be helpful
 
02:33:06.770 --> 02:33:06.780 align:start position:0%
towards a prosecution in order to hold
 
02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
offenders accountable and those
 
02:33:11.150 --> 02:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
discussions take place on a case-by-case
 
02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:12.410 align:start position:0%
discussions take place on a case-by-case
basis

02:33:12.410 --> 02:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
basis
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
in some cases a toxicology sample from a
 
02:33:18.469 --> 02:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
Survivor is very important and helpful
 
02:33:20.510 --> 02:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
evidence in a prosecution
 
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
in those cases law enforcement already
 
02:33:26.210 --> 02:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
has protocols in place and the ability
 
02:33:29.389 --> 02:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
to request a legal blood draw from a
 
02:33:33.290 --> 02:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
Survivor or to request already taken
 
02:33:35.690 --> 02:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
samples from a hospital for evidentiary
 
02:33:35.700 --> 02:33:37.250 align:start position:0%
samples from a hospital for evidentiary
purposes

02:33:37.250 --> 02:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
02:33:40.010 --> 02:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
those Protocols are in place and working
 
02:33:42.170 --> 02:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
02:33:44.929 --> 02:33:44.939 align:start position:0%
the first unintended consequence of this
 
02:33:48.110 --> 02:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
bill in my opinion is that in many cases
 
02:33:50.990 --> 02:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
depending on the drug involved and
 
02:33:52.610 --> 02:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
depending on the time frames of
 
02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
ingestion The Taking of a toxicology
 
02:33:57.710 --> 02:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
sample which is outside of our
 
02:34:00.110 --> 02:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
established protocols may actually be
 
02:34:03.050 --> 02:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
harmful to a prosecution
 
02:34:05.330 --> 02:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
the second unintended consequence of
 
02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
this bill in my opinion is related to
 
02:34:11.330 --> 02:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
storage Hospital toxicology labs are not
 
02:34:13.730 --> 02:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
equipped to store samples in a legal
 
02:34:16.309 --> 02:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
chain of custody manner police
 
02:34:17.929 --> 02:34:17.939 align:start position:0%
departments and the New Hampshire State
 
02:34:21.650 --> 02:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
Police forensic lab also do not have the
 
02:34:25.370 --> 02:34:25.380 align:start position:0%
space available to store a large influx
 
02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
of new samples taken outside of the
 
02:34:30.889 --> 02:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
established protocols for up to in some
 
02:34:34.190 --> 02:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
cases 40 years as may be required
 
02:34:36.889 --> 02:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
the third unintended consequence of this
 
02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
bill in my opinion is related to testing
 
02:34:42.410 --> 02:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
many hospitals as well as the New
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police forensic lab do
 
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
not have the ability to test for many
 
02:34:50.030 --> 02:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
substances that are commonly used in
 
02:34:52.849 --> 02:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
drug facilitated sexual assaults for
 
02:34:55.130 --> 02:34:55.140 align:start position:0%
this reason when law enforcement is
 
02:34:58.190 --> 02:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
working on a case of a drug facilitated
 
02:35:00.650 --> 02:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
sexual assault where a toxicology sample
 
02:35:02.750 --> 02:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
has been taken we have to send that
 
02:35:05.230 --> 02:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
sample to a private lab in Pennsylvania
 
02:35:08.270 --> 02:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
at a cost of approximately one thousand
 
02:35:10.010 --> 02:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
dollars per test
 
02:35:14.450 --> 02:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
we use that tool routinely when we along
 
02:35:16.370 --> 02:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
with prosecution believe that it will be
 
02:35:18.889 --> 02:35:18.899 align:start position:0%
helpful for a prosecution
 
02:35:21.889 --> 02:35:21.899 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I ask you to find that
 
02:35:24.230 --> 02:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is inexpedient to legislate in
 
02:35:26.270 --> 02:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
its current form I thank you for your
 
02:35:27.770 --> 02:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
time and I'm happy to answer your
 
02:35:29.809 --> 02:35:29.819 align:start position:0%
questions including maybe some of the
 
02:35:31.849 --> 02:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
questions that came up earlier that were
 
02:35:33.770 --> 02:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
not able to be answered
 
02:35:36.050 --> 02:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative King thank
 
02:35:38.090 --> 02:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
you chairman thank you chairman McDonald
 
02:35:40.309 --> 02:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here today
 
02:35:43.730 --> 02:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
um this is very interesting because
 
02:35:45.410 --> 02:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
there is a problem around the idea of
 
02:35:52.010 --> 02:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
sexual assault so we we know it's
 
02:35:53.630 --> 02:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
illegal just to drug somebody even if
 
02:35:55.309 --> 02:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
there is no sexual assault whatsoever
 
02:35:57.290 --> 02:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
right you can't just Spike somebody's
 
02:35:59.330 --> 02:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
drink and even if there's no sexual you
 
02:36:01.969 --> 02:36:01.979 align:start position:0%
just can't do that so but if a victim
 
02:36:04.250 --> 02:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
goes into a hospital and they say it's
 
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
sexual assault but there is no other you
 
02:36:08.570 --> 02:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
know DNA evidence or anything like that
 
02:36:10.849 --> 02:36:10.859 align:start position:0%
then there's this weird protocol
 
02:36:14.690 --> 02:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
loophole that prevents or allows for the
 
02:36:18.050 --> 02:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
prevention of taking a drug test but if
 
02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
the same victim were to go in there and
 
02:36:22.969 --> 02:36:22.979 align:start position:0%
just say I got drug no sexual assault it
 
02:36:25.250 --> 02:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
seems like there probably is some way
 
02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
for them to be like oh let's test for
 
02:36:28.969 --> 02:36:28.979 align:start position:0%
that so so you're telling me that if
 
02:36:30.050 --> 02:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
somebody were to go in there and say
 
02:36:31.790 --> 02:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
there was no sexual assault I was just
 
02:36:34.730 --> 02:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
drugged without you know my consent they
 
02:36:37.130 --> 02:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
can test for that but if you say and
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
there was sexual assault then they say
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
oh now I'm sorry that you you're in a
 
02:36:42.530 --> 02:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
loophole we can't test now anymore so so
 
02:36:44.330 --> 02:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
what is a person to do here it seems
 
02:36:45.410 --> 02:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
like there's this weird loophole where
 
02:36:48.290 --> 02:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
you know you just if if there's sexual
 
02:36:49.790 --> 02:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
assault but there's no other DNA
 
02:36:52.190 --> 02:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
evidence you'll get denied a test but if
 
02:36:55.370 --> 02:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
it's just you know if it's just you were
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
drugged without your consent then they
 
02:36:59.090 --> 02:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
will test you because I have a hard time
 
02:37:00.590 --> 02:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
imagining that if a person right now
 
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
goes to a hospital and says I was
 
02:37:04.370 --> 02:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
drugged without my consent that they're
 
02:37:05.570 --> 02:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
going to say no we're not going to test
 
02:37:06.830 --> 02:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
you of course they're going to test you
 
02:37:08.809 --> 02:37:08.819 align:start position:0%
so why wouldn't they test you in this
 
02:37:12.530 --> 02:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
other other case too thank you thank you
 
02:37:14.270 --> 02:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
for your question and I can only speak
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
from the law enforcement perspective but
 
02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
if a person comes into a police
 
02:37:20.990 --> 02:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
department or a hospital but in some way
 
02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
reports to law enforcement that they've
 
02:37:25.849 --> 02:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
been drugged that is a crime and law
 
02:37:28.250 --> 02:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
enforcement can request a legal blood
 
02:37:31.610 --> 02:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
draw from a medical professional for
 
02:37:34.190 --> 02:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
evidentiary purposes whether or not that
 
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
drugging was related to a sexual assault
 
02:37:39.770 --> 02:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
the specific evidence collection within
 
02:37:43.130 --> 02:37:43.140 align:start position:0%
a sexual assault kit is based on a
 
02:37:45.410 --> 02:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
variety of different factors in every
 
02:37:48.590 --> 02:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
sexual assault examination may result in
 
02:37:50.210 --> 02:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
different types of evidence being
 
02:37:51.770 --> 02:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
collected and different types of
 
02:37:54.290 --> 02:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
evidence being tested depending on the
 
02:37:57.469 --> 02:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
specific facts of that case so in many
 
02:37:57.479 --> 02:37:58.510 align:start position:0%
specific facts of that case so in many
cases

02:37:58.510 --> 02:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:38:01.309 --> 02:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
some cases a full kit is appropriate
 
02:38:05.450 --> 02:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
some cases a partial kit but we are
 
02:38:08.270 --> 02:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
going to tailor the evidence collection
 
02:38:10.370 --> 02:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
to what would actually be helpful to a
 
02:38:12.530 --> 02:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
prosecution so in a case where somebody
 
02:38:14.270 --> 02:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
may have been drugged there may have
 
02:38:16.130 --> 02:38:16.140 align:start position:0%
been an attempted sexual assault which
 
02:38:17.690 --> 02:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
is a very serious crime that we take
 
02:38:20.809 --> 02:38:20.819 align:start position:0%
seriously but where there may not be DNA
 
02:38:23.090 --> 02:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
evidence available to collect law
 
02:38:25.910 --> 02:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement can request a toxicology
 
02:38:28.730 --> 02:38:28.740 align:start position:0%
sample in coordination with prosecution
 
02:38:31.490 --> 02:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
as well as using other law enforcement
 
02:38:33.889 --> 02:38:33.899 align:start position:0%
Tools in that investigation such as
 
02:38:36.349 --> 02:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
victim interviews collection of digital
 
02:38:39.910 --> 02:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
forensic evidence off of mobile devices
 
02:38:42.830 --> 02:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
recorded one-party telephone calls so we
 
02:38:45.290 --> 02:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
have a whole tool belt of tools to deal
 
02:38:47.809 --> 02:38:47.819 align:start position:0%
with attempted sexual assaults drug
 
02:38:51.469 --> 02:38:51.479 align:start position:0%
facilitated assaults but not every case
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
calls for the specific evidence
 
02:38:58.370 --> 02:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
collection in the kit and not every
 
02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
single case even which might have been
 
02:39:03.590 --> 02:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
suspected to involve drugs not in every
 
02:39:05.809 --> 02:39:05.819 align:start position:0%
case would a toxicology sample be
 
02:39:09.050 --> 02:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
helpful the example that I use is in a
 
02:39:11.570 --> 02:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
case where we believe that the drug was
 
02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
in adjusted outside of the scientific
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
Windows where it would test positive
 
02:39:20.330 --> 02:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
taking that sample and creating a
 
02:39:22.429 --> 02:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
laboratory report that shows negative
 
02:39:25.010 --> 02:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
for all substances would actually be
 
02:39:27.170 --> 02:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
harmful in the prosecution of that case
 
02:39:30.590 --> 02:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
so we try to tailor what evidence we're
 
02:39:32.809 --> 02:39:32.819 align:start position:0%
collecting to the specific facts of each
 
02:39:34.849 --> 02:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
case in front of us
 
02:39:37.210 --> 02:39:37.220 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:39:39.770 --> 02:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
my apologies I just I'm I'm struggling
 
02:39:41.210 --> 02:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
to understand it seems like you're
 
02:39:42.590 --> 02:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
putting the car before the horse a
 
02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
little bit I mean it seems like the very
 
02:39:45.710 --> 02:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
first thing you do is just collect all
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
the evidence possible you worry about
 
02:39:49.370 --> 02:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
the prosecution later I mean there's not
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
a prosecute there's no attorney general
 
02:39:52.790 --> 02:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
in the hospital representative King I
 
02:39:54.530 --> 02:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
think he's basically just following
 
02:39:56.690 --> 02:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
protocols that have been given to you
 
02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
right yes and respectfully I I disagree
 
02:40:02.690 --> 02:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
there uh if you collect all of the
 
02:40:04.670 --> 02:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
evidence without regard to what evidence
 
02:40:06.830 --> 02:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
is probative in other words what
 
02:40:09.290 --> 02:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
evidence will establish guilt or
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
innocence uh that that unnecessary
 
02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
collection of evidence that will not be
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
probative can be used by for example
 
02:40:20.210 --> 02:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
defense counsel at a trial as sort of a
 
02:40:22.790 --> 02:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
red herring to say look the state has
 
02:40:25.130 --> 02:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
accused my client of a drug facilitated
 
02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and this Toxicology test
 
02:40:29.889 --> 02:40:29.899 align:start position:0%
shows no drugs in the victim system
 
02:40:32.929 --> 02:40:32.939 align:start position:0%
therefore you know my client is not
 
02:40:36.170 --> 02:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
guilty when we know that in many cases
 
02:40:38.510 --> 02:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
based on the type of drug and the time
 
02:40:41.090 --> 02:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
frames of ingestion a laboratory report
 
02:40:43.790 --> 02:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
would not normally show positive for
 
02:40:45.950 --> 02:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
that specific substance
 
02:40:47.110 --> 02:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
02:40:49.070 --> 02:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
02:40:50.630 --> 02:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:40:52.490 --> 02:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
chief for being here
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
02:40:56.030 --> 02:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
um basically getting a little deeper
 
02:40:59.530 --> 02:40:59.540 align:start position:0%
into that time frame it are there known
 
02:41:02.090 --> 02:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
standards about what the half-life and
 
02:41:04.969 --> 02:41:04.979 align:start position:0%
what the testing protocol is and would a
 
02:41:06.830 --> 02:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
negative result for something with a
 
02:41:08.990 --> 02:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
very short half-life be what the
 
02:41:11.090 --> 02:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
expected result is if you were drugged
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
with say Benadryl
 
02:41:15.230 --> 02:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
yes and I can't speak to the specific
 
02:41:17.870 --> 02:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
half-life for Benadryl or any other
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
specific drug as I'm not a chemist or a
 
02:41:22.969 --> 02:41:22.979 align:start position:0%
toxicologist however depending on the
 
02:41:25.309 --> 02:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
drug and the half-life involved there
 
02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
are going to be uh expected time frames
 
02:41:30.770 --> 02:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
in which it would be positive or
 
02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
negative also based on the amount of the
 
02:41:35.809 --> 02:41:35.819 align:start position:0%
drug too and the limits of detection and
 
02:41:38.090 --> 02:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
so the Attorney General's protocol for
 
02:41:40.370 --> 02:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
evidence collection and the forensic
 
02:41:42.410 --> 02:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
Labs protocol for their lab
 
02:41:45.170 --> 02:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
accreditation is all based around the
 
02:41:48.170 --> 02:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
best science available for time frames
 
02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
of collection and that's not specific to
 
02:41:53.870 --> 02:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
just toxicology samples that's uh that
 
02:41:56.210 --> 02:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
is applicable to other types of forensic
 
02:41:57.590 --> 02:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
evidence as well
 
02:42:00.410 --> 02:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
well thank you um and then as a
 
02:42:02.809 --> 02:42:02.819 align:start position:0%
follow-up are those evidence protocols
 
02:42:04.969 --> 02:42:04.979 align:start position:0%
limited by storage space and is this
 
02:42:07.370 --> 02:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
something where we're potentially not
 
02:42:09.050 --> 02:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
collecting evidence that we should have
 
02:42:11.389 --> 02:42:11.399 align:start position:0%
and is this something we should take to
 
02:42:13.070 --> 02:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
um the budget or others so that we can
 
02:42:14.690 --> 02:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
actually make sure that crimes in New
 
02:42:16.130 --> 02:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are appropriately prosecuted
 
02:42:20.510 --> 02:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
no the the protocols and the forensic
 
02:42:23.150 --> 02:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
Labs Protocols are based on the best
 
02:42:24.770 --> 02:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
scientific literature that's available
 
02:42:28.370 --> 02:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
as far as uh the lab equipment that's
 
02:42:31.790 --> 02:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
available and the types of results that
 
02:42:33.469 --> 02:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
can be expected of different types of
 
02:42:38.450 --> 02:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:39.889 --> 02:42:39.899 align:start position:0%
um previously you'd said that some
 
02:42:41.389 --> 02:42:41.399 align:start position:0%
evidence was not collected because of
 
02:42:43.910 --> 02:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
storage space so that's is that a
 
02:42:45.590 --> 02:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
correct statement or not a correct
 
02:42:47.030 --> 02:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
statement and I'm not trying to accuse
 
02:42:48.290 --> 02:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
you of anything I'm just trying to get
 
02:42:50.450 --> 02:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of this sure what what I
 
02:42:53.030 --> 02:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
was trying to suggest is that
 
02:42:55.130 --> 02:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
um an unintended consequence of this
 
02:42:56.990 --> 02:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
bill is that evidence may be need
 
02:42:59.030 --> 02:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
required hired to be collected and
 
02:43:01.610 --> 02:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
stored under this bill that is not going
 
02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
to be used for a prosecution and so it
 
02:43:06.650 --> 02:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
will increase the requirements of our
 
02:43:09.710 --> 02:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
storage space for evidence that is not
 
02:43:11.570 --> 02:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:43:13.730 --> 02:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
um helpful to a prosecution that's what
 
02:43:16.130 --> 02:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
I was intending to say thank you
 
02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
other representative McLean
 
02:43:20.330 --> 02:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:43:23.270 --> 02:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um we heard in in
 
02:43:26.090 --> 02:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsors opening testimony uh
 
02:43:28.849 --> 02:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
a case of a woman who went and
 
02:43:31.490 --> 02:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
desperately was trying to have a kit
 
02:43:34.010 --> 02:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
collected and you know there was a
 
02:43:35.929 --> 02:43:35.939 align:start position:0%
refusal so
 
02:43:38.270 --> 02:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
um I would like to think that as part of
 
02:43:41.270 --> 02:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
the discussions as to whether or not you
 
02:43:43.429 --> 02:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
go forward with that not only is it
 
02:43:45.290 --> 02:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
going to be the medical staff and the
 
02:43:47.330 --> 02:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
law enforcement but I'm hoping that the
 
02:43:49.550 --> 02:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
the victim has a voice in that
 
02:43:52.670 --> 02:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
discussion as well but oftentimes we
 
02:43:54.410 --> 02:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
have protocols Protocols are
 
02:43:56.210 --> 02:43:56.220 align:start position:0%
misunderstood because law enforcement
 
02:43:58.010 --> 02:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
are only human beings medical staff for
 
02:44:01.969 --> 02:44:01.979 align:start position:0%
only human beings so in a case where a
 
02:44:05.150 --> 02:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
victim feels that guess what I don't
 
02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
think you understand the protocol you
 
02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
may be law enforcement I really don't
 
02:44:10.550 --> 02:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
think you understand the protocol what
 
02:44:13.130 --> 02:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
modes of redress are available to a
 
02:44:14.929 --> 02:44:14.939 align:start position:0%
person in that case
 
02:44:17.210 --> 02:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I do sit on
 
02:44:19.130 --> 02:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's sexual assault
 
02:44:22.130 --> 02:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
insane Advisory Board and we have robust
 
02:44:24.410 --> 02:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
discussions at all of our meetings about
 
02:44:27.950 --> 02:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
specific cases we have discussions about
 
02:44:30.349 --> 02:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not the protocol should be
 
02:44:33.410 --> 02:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
amended to create new best practices as
 
02:44:36.230 --> 02:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
new situations arise we also have robust
 
02:44:38.450 --> 02:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
discussions about whether additional
 
02:44:41.630 --> 02:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
training is needed for medical providers
 
02:44:44.809 --> 02:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement for prosecution so
 
02:44:48.530 --> 02:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
we do that on an ongoing basis and so as
 
02:44:51.710 --> 02:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
situations arise where perhaps a
 
02:44:53.870 --> 02:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
provider or a law enforcement officer
 
02:44:56.630 --> 02:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
has not followed protocol then we will
 
02:45:01.190 --> 02:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
establish training memorandums or uh
 
02:45:04.969 --> 02:45:04.979 align:start position:0%
ongoing continuing education to ensure
 
02:45:07.790 --> 02:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
that everybody involved in the system is
 
02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
following the protocol going forward
 
02:45:14.270 --> 02:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up and you know and so I I do
 
02:45:16.490 --> 02:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
respect that answer and I do think you
 
02:45:18.889 --> 02:45:18.899 align:start position:0%
know that we do have to when mistakes do
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
happen take a step back learn from it
 
02:45:23.410 --> 02:45:23.420 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that that answer
 
02:45:27.530 --> 02:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
necessarily addresses the individual in
 
02:45:30.170 --> 02:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
that case who is saying I think that
 
02:45:32.330 --> 02:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
you're not adhering to the protocol is
 
02:45:34.370 --> 02:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
there anything that we have in the
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
moment aside from a follow-up review to
 
02:45:38.389 --> 02:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
say you know what
 
02:45:40.849 --> 02:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
you want to have a kind of an appeal of
 
02:45:43.309 --> 02:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
sorts yeah I can go and I can get a
 
02:45:44.929 --> 02:45:44.939 align:start position:0%
second ruling on that is there any
 
02:45:47.290 --> 02:45:47.300 align:start position:0%
mechanism like that that exists because
 
02:45:50.690 --> 02:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
a victim may not want to wait to have a
 
02:45:52.130 --> 02:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
review board come back and say yeah
 
02:45:53.870 --> 02:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
protocols were violated we need to
 
02:45:56.270 --> 02:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
retrain many people will want to have
 
02:45:58.910 --> 02:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
redress in the moment so I just want to
 
02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
get your thoughts on that I appreciate
 
02:46:02.990 --> 02:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
your question and I uh appreciate the
 
02:46:04.969 --> 02:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
point behind it that it's too late
 
02:46:06.830 --> 02:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes to close the door after the
 
02:46:09.469 --> 02:46:09.479 align:start position:0%
horse has left the barn that being said
 
02:46:12.290 --> 02:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
I I do think that in many situations
 
02:46:15.290 --> 02:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
when a report is made to law enforcement
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
there is a discussion at the time
 
02:46:19.610 --> 02:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
between law enforcement the medical
 
02:46:22.610 --> 02:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
provider and prosecution while
 
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
Consulting with the protocol to
 
02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
determine uh what the best course is
 
02:46:30.469 --> 02:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
going forward with respect to situations
 
02:46:32.510 --> 02:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
that are not reported to law enforcement
 
02:46:34.610 --> 02:46:34.620 align:start position:0%
and this is only a conversation between
 
02:46:37.070 --> 02:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
the patient and the medical provider I
 
02:46:38.389 --> 02:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
can't really speak to that because I'm
 
02:46:40.910 --> 02:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
not privileged of those discussions
 
02:46:45.290 --> 02:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:47.570 --> 02:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and also thank you
 
02:46:50.450 --> 02:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
officer Lee for taking this question at
 
02:46:52.190 --> 02:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
the very beginning of your testimony you
 
02:46:54.110 --> 02:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you were in support of
 
02:46:56.270 --> 02:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
the intent but not of the way it's
 
02:46:58.969 --> 02:46:58.979 align:start position:0%
written so can you offer up some ideas
 
02:47:01.490 --> 02:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
on how this bill would be amended to
 
02:47:04.070 --> 02:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
your liking
 
02:47:07.610 --> 02:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
I I support the intent of notifying
 
02:47:10.010 --> 02:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
victims of their rights that
 
02:47:14.090 --> 02:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
um are already in statute and already in
 
02:47:17.210 --> 02:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's protocol and uh
 
02:47:20.330 --> 02:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
that should be in place already and
 
02:47:24.349 --> 02:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
um but my concerns are specific to the
 
02:47:26.750 --> 02:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
requirement to offer a Toxicology test
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
and my concerns are specific to that
 
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
because a Toxicology test is not always
 
02:47:35.090 --> 02:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
helpful to an investigation and
 
02:47:37.490 --> 02:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
prosecution and in fact is sometimes
 
02:47:40.730 --> 02:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
harmful depending on the fact so I don't
 
02:47:43.250 --> 02:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
think that we should always offer a
 
02:47:46.010 --> 02:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
toxicology sample in cases where it is
 
02:47:48.469 --> 02:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
not going to move an investigation or a
 
02:47:54.410 --> 02:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:56.809 --> 02:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
thank you again chairman McDonald
 
02:47:58.250 --> 02:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
um I think you're getting to the Crux of
 
02:48:00.469 --> 02:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
the issue here which is you know forcing
 
02:48:03.530 --> 02:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
providers to provide something that they
 
02:48:05.630 --> 02:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
think is specious but at the end of the
 
02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
day you still have a victim who doesn't
 
02:48:09.230 --> 02:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
think it's specious
 
02:48:11.210 --> 02:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
please tell me there must be somewhere a
 
02:48:12.469 --> 02:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
person can go can they go to the local
 
02:48:15.050 --> 02:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
CVS and say give me a drug test and just
 
02:48:16.849 --> 02:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
hold on to that bottle maybe in a future
 
02:48:18.830 --> 02:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
day I'll come get you I mean or is there
 
02:48:20.330 --> 02:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
lit I mean you can get your blood tested
 
02:48:22.190 --> 02:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
for DNA to find out you know your
 
02:48:23.690 --> 02:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
ancestry come on there's got to be a way
 
02:48:25.610 --> 02:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
to get your blood tested for you know
 
02:48:28.010 --> 02:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
drugs in your system
 
02:48:30.650 --> 02:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
where where can they go right now if if
 
02:48:32.389 --> 02:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
everybody else is saying no we're not
 
02:48:33.469 --> 02:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
going to do that because of some weird
 
02:48:34.670 --> 02:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
protocol there's got to be somewhere
 
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
they can go even if they pay out of
 
02:48:37.849 --> 02:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
pocket come on tell me thank you
 
02:48:40.130 --> 02:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
there are private
 
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
um phlebotomists that could draw
 
02:48:43.849 --> 02:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
somebody's blood there are independent
 
02:48:46.429 --> 02:48:46.439 align:start position:0%
private Laboratories that can conduct
 
02:48:49.370 --> 02:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
blood tests however I I don't support
 
02:48:52.610 --> 02:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
generally uh private parties going that
 
02:48:54.530 --> 02:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
route as opposed to reporting to law
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement because those tests do not
 
02:48:59.750 --> 02:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh follow the chain of custody
 
02:49:02.090 --> 02:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
guidelines and very well may not be
 
02:49:04.370 --> 02:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
admissible in any kind of Court
 
02:49:06.170 --> 02:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
proceeding whether some civil or
 
02:49:09.590 --> 02:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
criminal so you know my suggestion is
 
02:49:12.250 --> 02:49:12.260 align:start position:0%
that victims report to law enforcement
 
02:49:14.809 --> 02:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
so that we can make sure that the
 
02:49:16.910 --> 02:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
procedures are followed and that the
 
02:49:18.590 --> 02:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
evidence is collected in a legally
 
02:49:20.150 --> 02:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
defensible way
 
02:49:22.910 --> 02:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon
 
02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:49:27.469 --> 02:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:49:27.479 --> 02:49:28.309 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:49:28.309 --> 02:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:30.770 --> 02:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about protocols
 
02:49:34.730 --> 02:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
if if a victim not knowing that they
 
02:49:36.590 --> 02:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
probably should go to the police first
 
02:49:39.650 --> 02:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
goes to an ER room and
 
02:49:42.530 --> 02:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
let some know that they've been
 
02:49:46.670 --> 02:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
sexually assaulted or maybe a drug rape
 
02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
type situation is there a protocol as
 
02:49:52.670 --> 02:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
far as time frame for getting that
 
02:49:54.830 --> 02:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
decision from a prosecutor or whatever
 
02:49:57.170 --> 02:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
to take a sample
 
02:50:00.290 --> 02:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
um and how long how long between them
 
02:50:02.570 --> 02:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
getting into the ER or even into the
 
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
police department how long a period of
 
02:50:06.770 --> 02:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
time does it take to get that decision
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
that a blood sample should be taken in
 
02:50:12.590 --> 02:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
the majority of sexual assault cases
 
02:50:14.570 --> 02:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
that we investigate the victim actually
 
02:50:17.210 --> 02:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
does present to the ER often before the
 
02:50:19.010 --> 02:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
police and the police department
 
02:50:22.250 --> 02:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
responds to the ER to begin the pro the
 
02:50:25.570 --> 02:50:25.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:28.969 --> 02:50:28.979 align:start position:0%
so if the beginning the investigation at
 
02:50:30.770 --> 02:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
that time would there be a request to
 
02:50:33.770 --> 02:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
take a toxicology
 
02:50:36.590 --> 02:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
um test yeah and again it depends on the
 
02:50:38.450 --> 02:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
specific circumstances but if I
 
02:50:41.809 --> 02:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
responded to the ER and a victim said I
 
02:50:43.969 --> 02:50:43.979 align:start position:0%
was I believe that I was drugged and
 
02:50:46.610 --> 02:50:46.620 align:start position:0%
they described feeling the effects of
 
02:50:48.830 --> 02:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
impairment from a potential drug and
 
02:50:50.210 --> 02:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
that they believed there was an
 
02:50:52.429 --> 02:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
attempted sexual assault but an assault
 
02:50:55.130 --> 02:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
that was not completed then
 
02:50:58.130 --> 02:50:58.140 align:start position:0%
um I would I have a canister with blood
 
02:51:00.530 --> 02:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
tubes in it that I carry in my cruiser
 
02:51:02.809 --> 02:51:02.819 align:start position:0%
and I would request the victim's consent
 
02:51:05.809 --> 02:51:05.819 align:start position:0%
to have the medical staff draw a legal
 
02:51:07.910 --> 02:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
blood draw for me with the victim's
 
02:51:09.770 --> 02:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
consent and then I would submit it to
 
02:51:13.130 --> 02:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
the appropriate lab for testing
 
02:51:16.670 --> 02:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cushman
 
02:51:18.170 --> 02:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:51:18.180 --> 02:51:19.429 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
question

02:51:19.429 --> 02:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:51:21.250 --> 02:51:21.260 align:start position:0%
where does that leave
 
02:51:24.349 --> 02:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
victims who are not ready to go to the
 
02:51:24.359 --> 02:51:25.190 align:start position:0%
victims who are not ready to go to the
police

02:51:25.190 --> 02:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
police
 
02:51:28.030 --> 02:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
who may be in the situation that the
 
02:51:30.290 --> 02:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
woman that we heard about in the
 
02:51:32.570 --> 02:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill
 
02:51:34.969 --> 02:51:34.979 align:start position:0%
um would find themselves in where does
 
02:51:36.349 --> 02:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
that leave them
 
02:51:38.450 --> 02:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh where that leaves us is that the
 
02:51:40.610 --> 02:51:40.620 align:start position:0%
medical provider should follow the
 
02:51:42.170 --> 02:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's protocol that's
 
02:51:45.889 --> 02:51:45.899 align:start position:0%
already in place that specifies when a
 
02:51:48.530 --> 02:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
toxicology sample should or should not
 
02:51:51.410 --> 02:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:53.150 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:51:53.150 --> 02:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:51:55.370 --> 02:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:51:58.550 --> 02:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
being here uh for us uh does New
 
02:52:01.370 --> 02:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a backlog of processing
 
02:52:03.469 --> 02:52:03.479 align:start position:0%
this kit
 
02:52:07.010 --> 02:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has traditionally had a
 
02:52:10.610 --> 02:52:10.620 align:start position:0%
backlog however uh we have obtained
 
02:52:14.450 --> 02:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
grant funding and that backlog is being
 
02:52:19.090 --> 02:52:19.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:21.050 --> 02:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
um uh you were talking about
 
02:52:27.650 --> 02:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
requirements for storage space and that
 
02:52:27.660 --> 02:52:29.030 align:start position:0%
requirements for storage space and that
um

02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:32.510 --> 02:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
um if there will be excessive new flow
 
02:52:35.349 --> 02:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
of kids
 
02:52:38.389 --> 02:52:38.399 align:start position:0%
7bn app storage can you give me some
 
02:52:41.150 --> 02:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
percentage of how much of storage is
 
02:52:44.210 --> 02:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
currently utilized with current flow is
 
02:52:46.610 --> 02:52:46.620 align:start position:0%
it close to 100 percent can we increase
 
02:52:50.090 --> 02:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
at five percent some estimate please
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
currently law enforcement storage is
 
02:52:55.309 --> 02:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
designed to temporarily store a sample
 
02:52:57.710 --> 02:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
until it is submitted to the appropriate
 
02:53:00.590 --> 02:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
lab and tested so a majority of smaller
 
02:53:03.110 --> 02:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
police departments have essentially a
 
02:53:06.290 --> 02:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
college dorm style mini fridge to hold
 
02:53:09.170 --> 02:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
samples for a short period of time until
 
02:53:11.389 --> 02:53:11.399 align:start position:0%
they are delivered to the lab larger
 
02:53:13.730 --> 02:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
police departments like mine have
 
02:53:16.610 --> 02:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
essentially a standard kitchen size
 
02:53:19.910 --> 02:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
refrigerator no police departments that
 
02:53:23.090 --> 02:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of have large industrial
 
02:53:26.630 --> 02:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
walk-in cooler style refrigerators to
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
store you know hundreds of samples for
 
02:53:33.230 --> 02:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
years or decades as might be
 
02:53:36.590 --> 02:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
contemplated under this system
 
02:53:39.110 --> 02:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you other representative Leon
 
02:53:41.750 --> 02:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you from
 
02:53:43.550 --> 02:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
the facts that you heard earlier on
 
02:53:46.130 --> 02:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
about the constituent do you think that
 
02:53:47.929 --> 02:53:47.939 align:start position:0%
that was an error on the healthcare
 
02:53:49.849 --> 02:53:49.859 align:start position:0%
providers from not offering that sample
 
02:53:52.070 --> 02:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
from what you heard
 
02:53:54.349 --> 02:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
it that is a difficult question for me
 
02:53:56.750 --> 02:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
to answer because I wasn't
 
02:53:58.550 --> 02:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
um you know privy to the facts of that
 
02:54:00.769 --> 02:54:00.779 align:start position:0%
case as they were happening
 
02:54:03.230 --> 02:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
um so I really hesitate to speculate on
 
02:54:03.240 --> 02:54:04.250 align:start position:0%
um so I really hesitate to speculate on
that

02:54:04.250 --> 02:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:06.410 --> 02:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
um I will say that there are situations
 
02:54:08.389 --> 02:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
that come before the Attorney General's
 
02:54:11.870 --> 02:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
Advisory board that specific cases or
 
02:54:14.690 --> 02:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
specific complaints where we identify
 
02:54:18.050 --> 02:54:18.060 align:start position:0%
weaknesses either in the protocol or in
 
02:54:20.210 --> 02:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
members of the system following the
 
02:54:22.490 --> 02:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
protocol as they should and when there
 
02:54:25.130 --> 02:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
are weaknesses in the protocol we vote
 
02:54:28.150 --> 02:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
as a board to amend the protocol to
 
02:54:31.190 --> 02:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that it is calling for best
 
02:54:34.490 --> 02:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
practices and when the protocol is
 
02:54:36.469 --> 02:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate but it's not being
 
02:54:39.230 --> 02:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
completely followed then we look for
 
02:54:41.150 --> 02:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
ways through the Attorney General's
 
02:54:43.610 --> 02:54:43.620 align:start position:0%
office through County Prosecutors
 
02:54:45.110 --> 02:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire Chiefs of
 
02:54:47.690 --> 02:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
Police Association to
 
02:54:47.700 --> 02:54:48.469 align:start position:0%
Police Association to
um

02:54:48.469 --> 02:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:51.170 --> 02:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
to get the word down to the boots on the
 
02:54:53.210 --> 02:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
ground for lack of a better word to
 
02:54:55.070 --> 02:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that the process is being
 
02:54:57.410 --> 02:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
followed and that's not specific only to
 
02:54:59.090 --> 02:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
sexual assault investigations that's
 
02:55:00.469 --> 02:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
every type of law enforcement
 
02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
investigation you know we want to
 
02:55:04.730 --> 02:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
improve and make sure that everybody's
 
02:55:08.750 --> 02:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:10.730 --> 02:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo
 
02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
02:55:15.710 --> 02:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my other question can you
 
02:55:18.290 --> 02:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
help me understand when police got
 
02:55:24.130 --> 02:55:24.140 align:start position:0%
involved so if a victim in eer
 
02:55:27.610 --> 02:55:27.620 align:start position:0%
is a victim offered to
 
02:55:31.870 --> 02:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
involve police or is there some
 
02:55:34.969 --> 02:55:34.979 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements to report to
 
02:55:38.929 --> 02:55:38.939 align:start position:0%
police's a and is it different like uh
 
02:55:41.809 --> 02:55:41.819 align:start position:0%
on in different cases like one case if
 
02:55:45.050 --> 02:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
there was like uh penetrated generally
 
02:55:47.110 --> 02:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
even as a case when there was like
 
02:55:50.450 --> 02:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
sexual assault without penetration or
 
02:55:53.150 --> 02:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
suitcase like somebody was drugged let's
 
02:55:56.210 --> 02:55:56.220 align:start position:0%
say for financial crime so in this
 
02:55:59.870 --> 02:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
different scenarios like uh how police
 
02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
got involved is it offered to victim or
 
02:56:07.389 --> 02:56:07.399 align:start position:0%
is medical professional required to
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
report to police thank you thank you for
 
02:56:13.969 --> 02:56:13.979 align:start position:0%
the question it is the uh survivor's
 
02:56:16.130 --> 02:56:16.140 align:start position:0%
decision whether or not to involve the
 
02:56:18.710 --> 02:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
police so a Survivor can go to a medical
 
02:56:24.830 --> 02:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
professional for an anonymous kit and in
 
02:56:28.670 --> 02:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
those situations the decision on whether
 
02:56:31.070 --> 02:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
a kit is conducted and what pieces of
 
02:56:33.170 --> 02:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
evidence are collected those decisions
 
02:56:35.090 --> 02:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
are made by the medical provider because
 
02:56:37.250 --> 02:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
the police are not involved and they
 
02:56:38.450 --> 02:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
should be following the Attorney
 
02:56:42.349 --> 02:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
General's protocol on that if the
 
02:56:44.510 --> 02:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
Survivor chooses to involve the police
 
02:56:48.590 --> 02:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
the police also should follow the
 
02:56:51.290 --> 02:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's protocol but again
 
02:56:53.990 --> 02:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
the more people that are involved in the
 
02:56:56.269 --> 02:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
discussion in the investigation and
 
02:56:58.790 --> 02:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
considering the facts of the case
 
02:56:58.800 --> 02:56:59.570 align:start position:0%
considering the facts of the case
um

02:56:59.570 --> 02:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:01.790 --> 02:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
the easier it is to come up with
 
02:57:04.969 --> 02:57:04.979 align:start position:0%
additional investigative tools that
 
02:57:08.750 --> 02:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
might be used to move a case forward
 
02:57:11.690 --> 02:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
okay other questions
 
02:57:13.610 --> 02:57:13.620 align:start position:0%
saying no other questions thank you
 
02:57:16.790 --> 02:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:18.469 --> 02:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
hey I have no one else signed up to
 
02:57:20.690 --> 02:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill does anyone else
 
02:57:22.490 --> 02:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
wish to testify
 
02:57:24.590 --> 02:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else I'm going to close
 
02:57:27.110 --> 02:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 378.
 
02:57:31.309 --> 02:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
our next hearing is scheduled for 1pm uh
 
02:57:33.469 --> 02:57:33.479 align:start position:0%
it's 11 56 currently so we're going to
 
02:57:36.650 --> 02:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
be in recess until 1 pm until and in
 
02:57:38.269 --> 02:57:38.279 align:start position:0%
that time we will be opening the public
 
04:02:33.229 --> 04:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:33.239 --> 04:02:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:02:35.150 --> 04:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:44.090 --> 04:02:44.100 align:start position:0%
It's One o'clock And I would like to
 
04:02:46.130 --> 04:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on House Bill
 
04:02:46.140 --> 04:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on House Bill
277

04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
277
 
04:02:51.170 --> 04:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
and begin with recognizing the prime
 
04:02:57.530 --> 04:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:59.090 --> 04:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
and again representative Reed I believe
 
04:03:01.370 --> 04:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
we need a card from you this time this
 
04:03:02.990 --> 04:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
time you actually do need a card for me
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't fill it out in time last time I
 
04:03:07.550 --> 04:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
had I always say it so
 
04:03:10.670 --> 04:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
it's coming Mr chair again thank you Mr
 
04:03:12.290 --> 04:03:12.300 align:start position:0%
chair and honorable members of the
 
04:03:12.300 --> 04:03:13.490 align:start position:0%
chair and honorable members of the
committee

04:03:13.490 --> 04:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:03:15.110 --> 04:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
um again for the record my name is Ellen
 
04:03:17.210 --> 04:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
Reed and I represent Newmarket in new
 
04:03:20.269 --> 04:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
fields which is Rockingham 10 and I want
 
04:03:22.610 --> 04:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
to apologize in advance this day is
 
04:03:25.969 --> 04:03:25.979 align:start position:0%
most of my bills are in election law and
 
04:03:27.530 --> 04:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
so this has been a very difficult day
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
and I didn't intend for both of the
 
04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
bills that impacted me on a very very
 
04:03:32.750 --> 04:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
personal level to be on the same day
 
04:03:35.510 --> 04:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
before the same committee uh but thems
 
04:03:41.450 --> 04:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
the breaks uh HB 277 is uh relative to a
 
04:03:42.830 --> 04:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
patient's right to sterilization
 
04:03:45.229 --> 04:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
treatment so once again I'm going to go
 
04:03:48.170 --> 04:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
through a story and um that and this
 
04:03:50.150 --> 04:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
happened to me
 
04:03:52.729 --> 04:03:52.739 align:start position:0%
um I have never in my life had a regular
 
04:03:52.739 --> 04:03:53.870 align:start position:0%
um I have never in my life had a regular
period

04:03:53.870 --> 04:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:03:55.910 --> 04:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh from the time that I started having
 
04:03:58.969 --> 04:03:58.979 align:start position:0%
periods they were maybe four months but
 
04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
it varied four months apart but then it
 
04:04:02.450 --> 04:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
would be several weeks of heavy heavy
 
04:04:05.689 --> 04:04:05.699 align:start position:0%
bleeding and my mom was not the kind of
 
04:04:07.670 --> 04:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
person to like talk openly about these
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
things so it wasn't until I was in
 
04:04:10.849 --> 04:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
college that I talked to a doctor and
 
04:04:12.530 --> 04:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
the doctor kind of dismissed me and said
 
04:04:14.030 --> 04:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
well as long as you're having a few a
 
04:04:16.849 --> 04:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
year you're fine so
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
um it continued and it got worse to the
 
04:04:21.530 --> 04:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
point that I went through a solid year
 
04:04:23.570 --> 04:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
of bleeding every day bleeding every
 
04:04:25.250 --> 04:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
single day for over a year
 
04:04:27.769 --> 04:04:27.779 align:start position:0%
I finally got diagnosed in my late 20s
 
04:04:29.650 --> 04:04:29.660 align:start position:0%
with PCOS
 
04:04:34.010 --> 04:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
which is just as in a nutshell too many
 
04:04:36.469 --> 04:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
hormones too many eggs
 
04:04:38.090 --> 04:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
um goes and it's more than that but
 
04:04:40.309 --> 04:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
that's basically what it is
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
so the they tried many different
 
04:04:45.650 --> 04:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
treatments uh all of which have to do
 
04:04:47.710 --> 04:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
with hormones and there was a
 
04:04:50.210 --> 04:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
breakthrough bleeding through all of the
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
treatments I went through this for 12
 
04:04:54.590 --> 04:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
years six different doctors
 
04:04:58.370 --> 04:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
um did IUD NuvaRing implants pills all
 
04:05:00.769 --> 04:05:00.779 align:start position:0%
of it it didn't fix the problem and and
 
04:05:02.269 --> 04:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
it's worth noting that through all this
 
04:05:05.689 --> 04:05:05.699 align:start position:0%
bleeding there's pain and um and
 
04:05:06.889 --> 04:05:06.899 align:start position:0%
embarrassment and everything because
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
it's very heavy bleeding
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
I went through a particularly difficult
 
04:05:13.490 --> 04:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
four months where the flow was so very
 
04:05:14.990 --> 04:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
heavy for four months straight that
 
04:05:16.610 --> 04:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
there was not a product on the market
 
04:05:18.410 --> 04:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
that could control what I was going
 
04:05:21.830 --> 04:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
through I had to wear adult diapers
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
um to to deal with what I was going
 
04:05:23.520 --> 04:05:24.410 align:start position:0%
um to to deal with what I was going
through

04:05:24.410 --> 04:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:05:26.929 --> 04:05:26.939 align:start position:0%
and that ended that four-month period
 
04:05:28.670 --> 04:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
ended with apparently something that's
 
04:05:30.769 --> 04:05:30.779 align:start position:0%
relatively rare called shedding a cast
 
04:05:33.889 --> 04:05:33.899 align:start position:0%
which is essentially giving birth to a
 
04:05:35.929 --> 04:05:35.939 align:start position:0%
mold of the inside of your uterus I have
 
04:05:38.269 --> 04:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
never had children I don't want children
 
04:05:39.830 --> 04:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
that never wanted children because I
 
04:05:42.349 --> 04:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
raised my four younger brothers
 
04:05:44.689 --> 04:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
um and so I didn't know what I was going
 
04:05:46.250 --> 04:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
through I didn't know I was literally on
 
04:05:48.590 --> 04:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
the phone with 9-1-1 when this was
 
04:05:50.809 --> 04:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
happening and uh
 
04:05:53.150 --> 04:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
so rewinding back through this entire
 
04:05:54.170 --> 04:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
time I'm going through all these
 
04:05:56.090 --> 04:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
different doctors they consistently tell
 
04:05:58.309 --> 04:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
me well one of the treatment the ideal
 
04:06:00.830 --> 04:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
treatment for you would be a
 
04:06:03.170 --> 04:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
hysterectomy and I would say that's
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
great because my husband has already had
 
04:06:07.490 --> 04:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
a vasectomy I chose at a young age to
 
04:06:09.349 --> 04:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
not have children I haven't changed my
 
04:06:12.130 --> 04:06:12.140 align:start position:0%
mind since we're not having children
 
04:06:15.170 --> 04:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
and every single doctor told me no no
 
04:06:17.090 --> 04:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
you're too young you don't know what
 
04:06:18.290 --> 04:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
you're going to want in the future
 
04:06:20.450 --> 04:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
you'll change your mind we're not going
 
04:06:22.670 --> 04:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
to give you this treatment mind you Not
 
04:06:24.410 --> 04:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
only would it have saved me all of the
 
04:06:26.030 --> 04:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
pain and suffering and bleeding and
 
04:06:27.650 --> 04:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
everything that I went through but also
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
as a PCOS sufferer I'm at an increased
 
04:06:33.469 --> 04:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
risk for uterine cancer and ovarian
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
cancer 90 of ovarian cancer happens in
 
04:06:36.950 --> 04:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
the Fallopian tubes which is removed
 
04:06:39.889 --> 04:06:39.899 align:start position:0%
during a typical a typical hysterectomy
 
04:06:42.110 --> 04:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
so I was put through increased risk of
 
04:06:43.610 --> 04:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
cancer in addition to all of the
 
04:06:45.290 --> 04:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
suffering that I went through for those
 
04:06:49.130 --> 04:06:49.140 align:start position:0%
12 years until I was 38 and a doctor
 
04:06:51.710 --> 04:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
finally decided that I was old and and
 
04:06:55.070 --> 04:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
passed my child bearing years and
 
04:06:56.330 --> 04:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
finally agreed to give me the
 
04:06:59.030 --> 04:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
hysterectomy now through all of this
 
04:07:00.830 --> 04:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
um I thought that this was just a me
 
04:07:02.210 --> 04:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
thing the fact that I was getting told
 
04:07:02.220 --> 04:07:04.070 align:start position:0%
thing the fact that I was getting told
no

04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:07:07.010 --> 04:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
um so I got the hysterectomy at 38 I
 
04:07:09.950 --> 04:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
became state rep at 36 so two years I
 
04:07:12.170 --> 04:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
suffered as a State Rep then three more
 
04:07:14.450 --> 04:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
years before I put in this bill and the
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
only reason I put in this bill is
 
04:07:17.809 --> 04:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
because I found a community of women
 
04:07:20.510 --> 04:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
across the country actually that
 
04:07:22.250 --> 04:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
experienced the same exact thing through
 
04:07:24.110 --> 04:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
a number a number of different medical
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
conditions uh but we're being told no in
 
04:07:29.809 --> 04:07:29.819 align:start position:0%
fact it's such a common practice in this
 
04:07:32.570 --> 04:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
medical community to deny particularly
 
04:07:34.670 --> 04:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
women although the bill is written in
 
04:07:37.550 --> 04:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
gender-neutral language uh and sex
 
04:07:39.950 --> 04:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
neutral but it's so such a common
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
practice that uh that the this community
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
of women across the country actually
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
curates a list of friendly doctors who
 
04:07:51.769 --> 04:07:51.779 align:start position:0%
will in fact believe you when you say I
 
04:07:53.090 --> 04:07:53.100 align:start position:0%
actually have made my mind up to not
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
have children
 
04:07:58.130 --> 04:07:58.140 align:start position:0%
so um the bill I'll just walk through
 
04:08:00.650 --> 04:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
there's three parts to the bill the
 
04:08:03.050 --> 04:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
first part is that if a patient has a
 
04:08:06.830 --> 04:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
medical diagnosis and a legitimate
 
04:08:08.349 --> 04:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
treatment for that medical condition
 
04:08:10.490 --> 04:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
includes a hysterectomy includes
 
04:08:12.889 --> 04:08:12.899 align:start position:0%
sterilization treatment I should say
 
04:08:15.170 --> 04:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
then the doctor cannot deny that
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
treatment if the patient so wants it on
 
04:08:20.689 --> 04:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
the basis solely on the basis of the
 
04:08:22.189 --> 04:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
doctor's perception of the patient's
 
04:08:24.290 --> 04:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
future reproductive desires the doctor
 
04:08:26.450 --> 04:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
can still deny it for religious reasons
 
04:08:28.010 --> 04:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
the doctor can still deny it for payment
 
04:08:30.530 --> 04:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
for any kind of medical reason any other
 
04:08:33.830 --> 04:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
reason just not no no you don't know
 
04:08:36.830 --> 04:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:38.570 --> 04:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill is that if
 
04:08:40.429 --> 04:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
it's a voluntary procedure the doctor
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
can deny it
 
04:08:44.570 --> 04:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
however the doctor has to refer them to
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
a a doctor who will perform the
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
procedure and takes their form of
 
04:08:48.720 --> 04:08:49.490 align:start position:0%
procedure and takes their form of
payment

04:08:49.490 --> 04:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
payment
 
04:08:51.650 --> 04:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
and the last part of the bill is simply
 
04:08:53.570 --> 04:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
there to protect the doctors that the
 
04:08:56.809 --> 04:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
doctor can require a signed informed
 
04:09:00.050 --> 04:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
consent waiver saying that you know that
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
you're getting sterilized so you cannot
 
04:09:04.490 --> 04:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
Sue and have no legal recourse when
 
04:09:06.410 --> 04:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
you're sterile now you can still sue for
 
04:09:08.210 --> 04:09:08.220 align:start position:0%
any number of
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know they left four steps in you or
 
04:09:12.170 --> 04:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
what have you but but the point is is
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
that you knew you were becoming sterile
 
04:09:15.650 --> 04:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
you made this decision and now you
 
04:09:18.110 --> 04:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
cannot sue for being sterile and that's
 
04:09:21.050 --> 04:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
the bill it's as simple as that but I
 
04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
think I really want to bring it back to
 
04:09:25.610 --> 04:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
the idea that these decisions need to be
 
04:09:28.429 --> 04:09:28.439 align:start position:0%
in the hands of patients who are
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
full-grown people
 
04:09:33.170 --> 04:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
and I just want to point out that the
 
04:09:35.330 --> 04:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
hypocrisy of this medical community and
 
04:09:37.250 --> 04:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
obviously there's not all because we
 
04:09:38.750 --> 04:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
have this wonderful list of doctors that
 
04:09:40.849 --> 04:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
are friendly and and believe patients
 
04:09:42.590 --> 04:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
when they say this is the decision I've
 
04:09:44.510 --> 04:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
made for myself
 
04:09:47.269 --> 04:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
um but a lot of the culture of the
 
04:09:49.370 --> 04:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
medical community they will say these
 
04:09:50.630 --> 04:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
are the same people that say they
 
04:09:52.490 --> 04:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
support a in particular a woman's right
 
04:09:54.590 --> 04:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
to control her own body but then they
 
04:09:56.570 --> 04:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
deny grown women with medical conditions
 
04:09:58.610 --> 04:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
the right to make a choice for one of
 
04:09:59.830 --> 04:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
those treatments for that condition
 
04:10:02.210 --> 04:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
because no no I know better than you
 
04:10:04.130 --> 04:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
what you're going to want in the future
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
these are also the same people who say
 
04:10:08.929 --> 04:10:08.939 align:start position:0%
rightfully I think that they support
 
04:10:11.150 --> 04:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
trans children rights to undergo
 
04:10:13.670 --> 04:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
treatment and I understand trans
 
04:10:15.170 --> 04:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
children almost never getting kind of
 
04:10:16.969 --> 04:10:16.979 align:start position:0%
surgery but then sometimes hormonal
 
04:10:20.150 --> 04:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
therapies uh can uh lead to
 
04:10:22.610 --> 04:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
sterilization and I have very limited
 
04:10:24.349 --> 04:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
knowledge about this I think that's
 
04:10:25.969 --> 04:10:25.979 align:start position:0%
right but then they say that a
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
full-grown person doesn't get to say
 
04:10:30.950 --> 04:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not they want this treatment
 
04:10:33.170 --> 04:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
versus that treatment because no no we
 
04:10:34.729 --> 04:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
know better than you
 
04:10:36.110 --> 04:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
about what you're going to want in your
 
04:10:36.120 --> 04:10:37.550 align:start position:0%
about what you're going to want in your
future

04:10:37.550 --> 04:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
future
 
04:10:39.889 --> 04:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
so I would really like to normalize the
 
04:10:42.110 --> 04:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
idea that in particular because this
 
04:10:45.410 --> 04:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
does impact women more that women get to
 
04:10:46.910 --> 04:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
make up their minds as to whether or not
 
04:10:49.070 --> 04:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
they have children and
 
04:10:51.050 --> 04:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
um you know I know this is obviously not
 
04:10:52.550 --> 04:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
an abortion Bill I know abortion is a
 
04:10:54.889 --> 04:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
Hot Topic and I'm not looking to get
 
04:10:56.570 --> 04:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
into that argument but this does reduce
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
the need for abortion because if people
 
04:11:01.969 --> 04:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
have the right to to make that decision
 
04:11:03.290 --> 04:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
ahead of time then you don't have to
 
04:11:05.090 --> 04:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
deal with that problem
 
04:11:07.729 --> 04:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
so I just want to normalize the idea of
 
04:11:09.229 --> 04:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
living Child free lives and normalize
 
04:11:11.450 --> 04:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
the idea that adults get to make their
 
04:11:13.729 --> 04:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
decisions for their health care options
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take questions
 
04:11:19.370 --> 04:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:21.110 --> 04:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:11:23.809 --> 04:11:23.819 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:11:23.819 --> 04:11:24.710 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

04:11:24.710 --> 04:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:26.150 --> 04:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
I've read the bill over several times
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to understand it exactly
 
04:11:31.729 --> 04:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
but my concern is or my question is
 
04:11:34.849 --> 04:11:34.859 align:start position:0%
especially in part A is this mandating
 
04:11:37.370 --> 04:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
that a physician or surgeon say a
 
04:11:39.469 --> 04:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
gynecologist who is skilled at
 
04:11:39.479 --> 04:11:41.450 align:start position:0%
gynecologist who is skilled at
hysterectomy

04:11:41.450 --> 04:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
hysterectomy
 
04:11:41.460 --> 04:11:42.889 align:start position:0%
hysterectomy
boarded

04:11:42.889 --> 04:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
boarded
 
04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
is forced to do a hysterectomy if he or
 
04:11:48.170 --> 04:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
she does not want to do it or does not
 
04:11:49.550 --> 04:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
think it's the appropriate course of
 
04:11:51.710 --> 04:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
action no if they think it's an
 
04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
inappropriate course of action for
 
04:11:55.370 --> 04:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
medical reasons for religious reasons
 
04:11:57.650 --> 04:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
they can still deny it the only thing it
 
04:11:59.990 --> 04:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
says is that you can't deny it on the
 
04:12:01.910 --> 04:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
basis of I think I know better than you
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
what you want to do with your future in
 
04:12:05.150 --> 04:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
terms of children
 
04:12:07.330 --> 04:12:07.340 align:start position:0%
that's the only condition
 
04:12:09.410 --> 04:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:12:14.170 --> 04:12:14.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:17.570 --> 04:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
community of friendly Physicians or
 
04:12:19.490 --> 04:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
surgeons or whomever will do the
 
04:12:22.670 --> 04:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
procedure a serialization procedure why
 
04:12:24.469 --> 04:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
does this become necessary then if there
 
04:12:26.809 --> 04:12:26.819 align:start position:0%
are others that will do it as opposed to
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who does not feel it's the
 
04:12:31.429 --> 04:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate medical procedure for you or
 
04:12:34.189 --> 04:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
any patient so few and far between the
 
04:12:36.290 --> 04:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
list that they had only contained four
 
04:12:38.570 --> 04:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
doctors in all of New Hampshire
 
04:12:38.580 --> 04:12:39.769 align:start position:0%
doctors in all of New Hampshire
so

04:12:39.769 --> 04:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:42.050 --> 04:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
I think we have more people testifying
 
04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
as to the need and for doctors would not
 
04:12:47.090 --> 04:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
meet those needs
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
just one quick phone sure it does follow
 
04:12:52.189 --> 04:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
up to the initial question so it does it
 
04:12:54.650 --> 04:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
is a mandate of sorts then correct only
 
04:12:57.469 --> 04:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
in the sense that a doctor can't insert
 
04:13:00.229 --> 04:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
their personal opinion about your
 
04:13:02.750 --> 04:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
personal decisions in the future
 
04:13:04.910 --> 04:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to making a decision
 
04:13:07.130 --> 04:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
medically that's all it would be the
 
04:13:09.229 --> 04:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
same as if a doctor were to insert their
 
04:13:12.530 --> 04:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
opinion on who you should date or insert
 
04:13:14.689 --> 04:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
their opinion on you know what color you
 
04:13:16.429 --> 04:13:16.439 align:start position:0%
should wear the flavor of food that you
 
04:13:18.769 --> 04:13:18.779 align:start position:0%
like they should not and I think it's
 
04:13:20.570 --> 04:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
across the board they should not be
 
04:13:22.490 --> 04:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
inserting those opinions those personal
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
opinions they should only be making
 
04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
decisions based on your medical needs
 
04:13:28.969 --> 04:13:28.979 align:start position:0%
and these are conditions where these
 
04:13:30.889 --> 04:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
people mostly women mostly people with
 
04:13:34.250 --> 04:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
uterus as I should say actually do need
 
04:13:36.530 --> 04:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
these procedures which you will hear
 
04:13:38.710 --> 04:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
more from
 
04:13:41.090 --> 04:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you chairman
 
04:13:41.100 --> 04:13:43.550 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you chairman
McDonald

04:13:43.550 --> 04:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:46.370 --> 04:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking questions
 
04:13:49.010 --> 04:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
do you are you concerned at all with
 
04:13:52.070 --> 04:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences blowback
 
04:13:54.050 --> 04:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
um you know when you have somebody
 
04:13:57.050 --> 04:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
potentially doing
 
04:13:59.450 --> 04:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
um something that they really don't want
 
04:14:01.790 --> 04:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
to for whatever reason they do it
 
04:14:04.610 --> 04:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
begrudgingly that the quality of care
 
04:14:07.910 --> 04:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
could be less than desirable and when
 
04:14:10.010 --> 04:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with something like a
 
04:14:13.010 --> 04:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
surgery that could could kill a person I
 
04:14:15.650 --> 04:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
mean people do die in surgery do you do
 
04:14:17.809 --> 04:14:17.819 align:start position:0%
you really want to have a doctor
 
04:14:20.210 --> 04:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
performing a potentially deadly surgery
 
04:14:22.610 --> 04:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
when he doesn't have
 
04:14:25.729 --> 04:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
full Gusto the full weight of his
 
04:14:27.469 --> 04:14:27.479 align:start position:0%
conscience supporting him do you really
 
04:14:30.650 --> 04:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
want somebody that is only doing it
 
04:14:33.410 --> 04:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
because the law says I mean I I
 
04:14:35.689 --> 04:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
personally think that that could lead to
 
04:14:35.699 --> 04:14:37.189 align:start position:0%
personally think that that could lead to
disasters

04:14:37.189 --> 04:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
disasters
 
04:14:37.199 --> 04:14:37.729 align:start position:0%
disasters
um

04:14:37.729 --> 04:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:39.410 --> 04:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
maybe it's better just to go the extra
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
distance find those four doctors that
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
can do it with their full conscience
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
behind them as opposed to somebody who's
 
04:14:47.330 --> 04:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
just doing it because they have to I
 
04:14:49.910 --> 04:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
mean that's that's scary to me so thank
 
04:14:52.490 --> 04:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
you for the question we mandate a lot of
 
04:14:53.870 --> 04:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
things out of the medical community
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
because anytime we have given a lot of
 
04:15:00.050 --> 04:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
power to really anyone in society they
 
04:15:01.490 --> 04:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
have a lot of responsibility back
 
04:15:04.969 --> 04:15:04.979 align:start position:0%
doctors have a lot of power over people
 
04:15:07.130 --> 04:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
because they control their health
 
04:15:10.189 --> 04:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
so we mandate a lot of things so you
 
04:15:12.769 --> 04:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
can't as a doctor for example
 
04:15:15.530 --> 04:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
um insert any number of personal
 
04:15:17.150 --> 04:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
opinions that would impact that
 
04:15:19.130 --> 04:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
patient's Health you have to act in the
 
04:15:20.809 --> 04:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
patient's best interest Hippocratic oath
 
04:15:23.269 --> 04:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
and all of that so to the extent we're
 
04:15:26.210 --> 04:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
normalizing the idea that that's how you
 
04:15:27.769 --> 04:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
should actually be making decisions and
 
04:15:30.050 --> 04:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
not through this kind of toxic basically
 
04:15:33.349 --> 04:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
misogynistic culture that's a good thing
 
04:15:33.359 --> 04:15:35.269 align:start position:0%
misogynistic culture that's a good thing
so

04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
is it can you say that in the interim
 
04:15:39.889 --> 04:15:39.899 align:start position:0%
while you're normalizing that that some
 
04:15:41.570 --> 04:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
of these doctors might say you know what
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
my heart's really not in it why don't
 
04:15:45.469 --> 04:15:45.479 align:start position:0%
you go to some other doctor yeah sure
 
04:15:47.809 --> 04:15:47.819 align:start position:0%
that could happen but we have a standard
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
of care for a reason and and I really
 
04:15:52.729 --> 04:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
think that if they're not willing to
 
04:15:56.030 --> 04:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
listen to their patients desires about
 
04:15:57.710 --> 04:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
what they want to do with their life
 
04:15:59.809 --> 04:15:59.819 align:start position:0%
then maybe they should not be in that
 
04:16:01.130 --> 04:16:01.140 align:start position:0%
particular field anyway and we should
 
04:16:02.750 --> 04:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
not be normalizing that particular
 
04:16:02.760 --> 04:16:04.790 align:start position:0%
not be normalizing that particular
mindset

04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
mindset
 
04:16:07.429 --> 04:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Palazzo
 
04:16:10.010 --> 04:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:16:12.650 --> 04:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm concerned about
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh Patsy because we give some additional
 
04:16:17.279 --> 04:16:19.450 align:start position:0%
uh Patsy because we give some additional
immunity

04:16:19.450 --> 04:16:19.460 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
04:16:23.450 --> 04:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
and informative informed consent is
 
04:16:26.510 --> 04:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
important but I'm concerned that
 
04:16:31.090 --> 04:16:31.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh side effects are not
 
04:16:34.189 --> 04:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
properly discussed like in my personal
 
04:16:34.199 --> 04:16:35.630 align:start position:0%
properly discussed like in my personal
experience

04:16:35.630 --> 04:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:16:35.640 --> 04:16:36.950 align:start position:0%
experience
uh

04:16:36.950 --> 04:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:16:40.130 --> 04:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
just I mean before placidia I was made
 
04:16:43.130 --> 04:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
to sign a paper like oh by the way all
 
04:16:45.769 --> 04:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
this like and you may die and this side
 
04:16:48.170 --> 04:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
effect and that side effect and it was
 
04:16:50.030 --> 04:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
not discussed with me before but I
 
04:16:52.550 --> 04:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
already like kind of concerned just
 
04:16:54.370 --> 04:16:54.380 align:start position:0%
signing a paper
 
04:16:57.769 --> 04:16:57.779 align:start position:0%
for me it's why do we need this
 
04:16:59.510 --> 04:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
additional immunity
 
04:17:02.269 --> 04:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
so I thank you for the question
 
04:17:04.849 --> 04:17:04.859 align:start position:0%
um I agree with you I think the
 
04:17:06.469 --> 04:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
committee knows now I agree with you
 
04:17:08.990 --> 04:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
that doctors need to be informing their
 
04:17:10.610 --> 04:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
patients a lot more than they currently
 
04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
are in general
 
04:17:15.769 --> 04:17:15.779 align:start position:0%
um and with some things in particular
 
04:17:18.110 --> 04:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
so it that is a definite problem that
 
04:17:19.849 --> 04:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed it's a separate
 
04:17:22.429 --> 04:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
problem than than this problem which is
 
04:17:24.950 --> 04:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
specifically a misogynistic culture
 
04:17:28.370 --> 04:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
making determinations mostly for women
 
04:17:30.290 --> 04:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
um about what they can and can't
 
04:17:33.469 --> 04:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
treatments they can and can't access so
 
04:17:36.290 --> 04:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
yes the doctors need to be more
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
informative when it comes to things I it
 
04:17:40.969 --> 04:17:40.979 align:start position:0%
I mean if you wanted to remove the
 
04:17:42.050 --> 04:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to remove that that's
 
04:17:43.969 --> 04:17:43.979 align:start position:0%
fine I was trying to help the medical
 
04:17:45.710 --> 04:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
community out by saying okay we're
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
saying that you have to have this
 
04:17:48.769 --> 04:17:48.779 align:start position:0%
standard of care so we're going to
 
04:17:50.809 --> 04:17:50.819 align:start position:0%
protect you and kind of balance that out
 
04:17:52.250 --> 04:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
it's up to the committee if you want to
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:58.610 --> 04:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:00.050 --> 04:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you
 
04:18:01.370 --> 04:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
04:18:03.530 --> 04:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Missouri yeah
 
04:18:05.689 --> 04:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry no no it's fine
 
04:18:07.309 --> 04:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
04:18:09.769 --> 04:18:09.779 align:start position:0%
question so you mentioned that list of
 
04:18:13.010 --> 04:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
four providers currently who would do
 
04:18:15.050 --> 04:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
this so how do you foresee that that
 
04:18:18.290 --> 04:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
list would grow with the passage of this
 
04:18:21.050 --> 04:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
like because it sounds like
 
04:18:23.870 --> 04:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
maybe they've already made that decision
 
04:18:26.090 --> 04:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
and that's why they put themselves on
 
04:18:28.790 --> 04:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
that list of four providers well they
 
04:18:31.490 --> 04:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
don't put themselves on but yeah
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
but so you think that others
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
would willingly be added to that list I
 
04:18:39.769 --> 04:18:39.779 align:start position:0%
think that once you're saying you cannot
 
04:18:42.170 --> 04:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
behave in this way anymore that you're
 
04:18:44.689 --> 04:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
normalizing a better healthier culture
 
04:18:48.170 --> 04:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
and attitude towards patients rights to
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
make their own decisions when it comes
 
04:18:51.050 --> 04:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
to their treatment when it's legitimate
 
04:18:52.729 --> 04:18:52.739 align:start position:0%
medical decisions now I'm not ever
 
04:18:54.710 --> 04:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
saying that they should be able to make
 
04:18:56.450 --> 04:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
a decision that is not in their medical
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
best interest but these are doctors is
 
04:19:00.769 --> 04:19:00.779 align:start position:0%
saying yeah this is medically best for
 
04:19:02.210 --> 04:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
you but
 
04:19:04.670 --> 04:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to want to have kids so by
 
04:19:07.550 --> 04:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
normalizing that that is by saying that
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's not good and normalizing a
 
04:19:10.990 --> 04:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
culture that
 
04:19:13.969 --> 04:19:13.979 align:start position:0%
rightfully gives the decision to the
 
04:19:16.070 --> 04:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
patients you're going to end up with
 
04:19:18.290 --> 04:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
more and more doctors that see this as
 
04:19:20.330 --> 04:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
the correct way of doing things
 
04:19:21.590 --> 04:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
because it's the legal way of doing
 
04:19:24.670 --> 04:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
things yeah and you also mentioned the
 
04:19:27.110 --> 04:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
misogynistic culture
 
04:19:29.929 --> 04:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
um is that in the provider field or like
 
04:19:32.630 --> 04:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
cultural in culture in general because
 
04:19:34.790 --> 04:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
there are I know of many many many
 
04:19:38.450 --> 04:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
female providers so being female does
 
04:19:39.889 --> 04:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
not disqualify you from being
 
04:19:39.899 --> 04:19:41.990 align:start position:0%
not disqualify you from being
misogynistic

04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
misogynistic
 
04:19:44.210 --> 04:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
um that those two things are independent
 
04:19:47.150 --> 04:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
of each other and we unfortunately have
 
04:19:50.750 --> 04:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
a culture going back into history that
 
04:19:53.870 --> 04:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
sees women as reproducers
 
04:19:57.290 --> 04:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
sees the role of women primarily early
 
04:20:00.050 --> 04:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
in life as having to look a certain way
 
04:20:02.809 --> 04:20:02.819 align:start position:0%
and then later in life as producing
 
04:20:04.790 --> 04:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
children and that's the main role of
 
04:20:07.130 --> 04:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
women that's an old very old-fashioned
 
04:20:09.889 --> 04:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
way of looking at it but it's still the
 
04:20:11.330 --> 04:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
the remnants of it are still in our
 
04:20:13.969 --> 04:20:13.979 align:start position:0%
culture today and to the the extent that
 
04:20:15.650 --> 04:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
it's still in our culture today the
 
04:20:19.130 --> 04:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
medical field has adopted some of that
 
04:20:20.689 --> 04:20:20.699 align:start position:0%
because they are denying people the
 
04:20:24.290 --> 04:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
right to have needed needed procedures
 
04:20:26.750 --> 04:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
medically necessary procedures because
 
04:20:28.729 --> 04:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
no no you're going to want to have kids
 
04:20:31.729 --> 04:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
even when I tell you as a 32 year old I
 
04:20:31.739 --> 04:20:34.189 align:start position:0%
even when I tell you as a 32 year old I
don't

04:20:34.189 --> 04:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:36.349 --> 04:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:20:44.929 --> 04:20:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
04:20:49.030 --> 04:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative Daniel
 
04:20:51.110 --> 04:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
papavichi Mueller
 
04:20:52.550 --> 04:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully I
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
announce that fairly close
 
04:20:57.349 --> 04:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:20:59.150 --> 04:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
committee members and by the way up to
 
04:21:01.729 --> 04:21:01.739 align:start position:0%
now it was the absolute best first shot
 
04:21:03.650 --> 04:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
at my last name or second shot at my
 
04:21:06.110 --> 04:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
last name that I've had again keep it to
 
04:21:08.290 --> 04:21:08.300 align:start position:0%
three minutes that'd be great
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
excuse me I was planning to speak very
 
04:21:12.830 --> 04:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
briefly and I will try to keep it very
 
04:21:12.840 --> 04:21:14.269 align:start position:0%
briefly and I will try to keep it very
brief

04:21:14.269 --> 04:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
brief
 
04:21:16.610 --> 04:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
when I learned about this bill
 
04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
I read it and
 
04:21:22.670 --> 04:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
I really you know it seems like a very
 
04:21:26.030 --> 04:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
straightforward type of situation where
 
04:21:27.950 --> 04:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
we should respect people's rights to
 
04:21:27.960 --> 04:21:28.849 align:start position:0%
we should respect people's rights to
make

04:21:28.849 --> 04:21:28.859 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:21:31.429 --> 04:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
decisions that only affect themselves
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
right it's my body I should have the
 
04:21:36.410 --> 04:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
ability to control what I do to it
 
04:21:38.450 --> 04:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
you know there are plenty of things that
 
04:21:40.370 --> 04:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
I see other people do that I disagree
 
04:21:42.170 --> 04:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
with but it's their body you know I'm
 
04:21:43.550 --> 04:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
not there to tell them what the
 
04:21:46.490 --> 04:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
consequences of that may be
 
04:21:48.769 --> 04:21:48.779 align:start position:0%
so to me I look at it from the point of
 
04:21:51.590 --> 04:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
view of just respecting people's agency
 
04:21:54.410 --> 04:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
and I want to make it very clear that I
 
04:21:56.689 --> 04:21:56.699 align:start position:0%
do not feel in any way that anybody is
 
04:21:59.330 --> 04:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
trying to treat people differently
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
because of you know
 
04:22:04.910 --> 04:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
being women or men or whatnot but there
 
04:22:07.490 --> 04:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
is a implicit assumption in a lot of us
 
04:22:09.410 --> 04:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
that actually is seen in a lot of other
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
legal areas where there are biases in
 
04:22:13.790 --> 04:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
the law in the practice that were put
 
04:22:15.650 --> 04:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
there forward seemed like good reasons
 
04:22:16.790 --> 04:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
04:22:20.090 --> 04:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
and which are no longer good reasons
 
04:22:22.790 --> 04:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
if you look at this bill there were
 
04:22:24.769 --> 04:22:24.779 align:start position:0%
questions rate about a couple of things
 
04:22:28.670 --> 04:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
one of them would be in letter A that a
 
04:22:32.030 --> 04:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
physician may be less than a hundred
 
04:22:34.010 --> 04:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
percent when required to perform a
 
04:22:36.349 --> 04:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
procedure they really disagree with
 
04:22:38.750 --> 04:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
and I've spoken with you know medical
 
04:22:42.469 --> 04:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
doctors and I I agree that that is a you
 
04:22:43.910 --> 04:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
know concern
 
04:22:46.130 --> 04:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
but I want to point out that while the
 
04:22:48.170 --> 04:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
text of the law does not specifically
 
04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
say you can deny it by referring it to
 
04:22:53.269 --> 04:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
somebody else it does not prevent that
 
04:22:55.070 --> 04:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
choice from being offered to the patient
 
04:22:57.290 --> 04:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
the doctor who will tell the patient
 
04:22:59.929 --> 04:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
look if I have to do this procedure I
 
04:23:01.849 --> 04:23:01.859 align:start position:0%
will do it but I think he would be best
 
04:23:03.889 --> 04:23:03.899 align:start position:0%
off if you went to this doctor that also
 
04:23:06.110 --> 04:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
takes this insurance who would feel much
 
04:23:08.030 --> 04:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
more comfortable and has done this more
 
04:23:10.189 --> 04:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
often and you would be in better hands
 
04:23:12.469 --> 04:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
most patients would probably be very
 
04:23:14.809 --> 04:23:14.819 align:start position:0%
happy to be recommended that way in the
 
04:23:16.849 --> 04:23:16.859 align:start position:0%
rare situations when that's not a choice
 
04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
it seems that the only choice the
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
patient has is to not receive a
 
04:23:22.370 --> 04:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
treatment that's medically necessary and
 
04:23:25.010 --> 04:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
there are balances we have to make the
 
04:23:26.870 --> 04:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
Mandate part concerned me right I
 
04:23:28.370 --> 04:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
thought about it because it is
 
04:23:31.070 --> 04:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
Meaningful but I think it's a minimal
 
04:23:33.530 --> 04:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
infringement a minimal mandate in very
 
04:23:35.809 --> 04:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
specific circumstances and for good
 
04:23:35.819 --> 04:23:37.070 align:start position:0%
specific circumstances and for good
reasons

04:23:37.070 --> 04:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about on the basis of
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
perceived future reproductive desires of
 
04:23:43.969 --> 04:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
the patient there are many other reasons
 
04:23:46.130 --> 04:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
why this procedure can be denied
 
04:23:49.189 --> 04:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
medically and so on but that's just not
 
04:23:51.950 --> 04:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
a good reason as far as I'm concerned
 
04:23:53.330 --> 04:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
the other question was for
 
04:23:55.130 --> 04:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
representative polosov in terms of the
 
04:23:57.530 --> 04:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
waiver of liability the waiver of
 
04:24:00.110 --> 04:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
liability is essential in this bill
 
04:24:02.330 --> 04:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
because you are mandating that medical
 
04:24:05.150 --> 04:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
providers do this legally how would it
 
04:24:07.550 --> 04:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
be fair for them to then be sued in
 
04:24:09.710 --> 04:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
civil court for doing what the patient
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
told them and they had a legal
 
04:24:14.150 --> 04:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
obligation to do I mean if we are going
 
04:24:16.189 --> 04:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
to have a mandate we have to have the
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
shield from civil liability for that
 
04:24:20.389 --> 04:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
mandate we create
 
04:24:22.729 --> 04:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
this is no different than you know 28
 
04:24:25.070 --> 04:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
day if we impose a spending mandate we
 
04:24:27.650 --> 04:24:27.660 align:start position:0%
should pay for it if you impose this
 
04:24:29.269 --> 04:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
mandate then you should provide the
 
04:24:31.610 --> 04:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
proper shield for the Physicians
 
04:24:34.250 --> 04:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
and um you can start wrapping up please
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
I will and I really appreciate it
 
04:24:38.090 --> 04:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
actually I'm gonna wrap it right right
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
now I know that I took more than one
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
minute but I did expand a little bit
 
04:24:44.269 --> 04:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
from my original plans and I appreciate
 
04:24:47.090 --> 04:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
your understanding thank you sir
 
04:24:49.729 --> 04:24:49.739 align:start position:0%
uh questions yes representative McLean
 
04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:24:53.210 --> 04:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:24:57.229 --> 04:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
um in uh paragraph B of the bill which
 
04:25:00.170 --> 04:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
is basically when you're asking for a
 
04:25:02.450 --> 04:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
sterilizing procedure without any
 
04:25:04.670 --> 04:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
underlying medical condition
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
the bill allows you to say no I'm not
 
04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that but I'm going to
 
04:25:12.349 --> 04:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
refer you to another position
 
04:25:17.150 --> 04:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
but in in section A that right of
 
04:25:20.630 --> 04:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
referral is denied to the position so it
 
04:25:23.750 --> 04:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
is effectively in in part A a mandate
 
04:25:25.790 --> 04:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
that says they do have to do it because
 
04:25:29.210 --> 04:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
the option of referral is taken away do
 
04:25:30.950 --> 04:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know why
 
04:25:34.250 --> 04:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
um why that right of referral was
 
04:25:36.769 --> 04:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
included in section B but not in section
 
04:25:36.779 --> 04:25:38.929 align:start position:0%
included in section B but not in section
A

04:25:38.929 --> 04:25:38.939 align:start position:0%
A
 
04:25:41.330 --> 04:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
I cannot speak for the prime sponsor and
 
04:25:43.070 --> 04:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a question I ask them directly
 
04:25:46.070 --> 04:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
but I will say that as somebody who had
 
04:25:48.110 --> 04:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
a discussion about an optional
 
04:25:50.149 --> 04:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
sterilization procedure somewhere in my
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
40s with my physician my experience has
 
04:25:56.030 --> 04:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
been that I got no pushback whatsoever
 
04:25:58.130 --> 04:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
and yet I read about a lot of story
 
04:26:00.590 --> 04:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
about people who have that pushback a
 
04:26:03.050 --> 04:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
lot in exactly the situation prescribed
 
04:26:05.210 --> 04:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
in paragraph B so
 
04:26:08.510 --> 04:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
personally and I hope I'm not getting in
 
04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
trouble here I wouldn't really
 
04:26:14.210 --> 04:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
object to the committee
 
04:26:17.030 --> 04:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
expanding that language to paragraph a
 
04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
as long as a physician can be found that
 
04:26:22.189 --> 04:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
will perform that procedure if this is
 
04:26:24.530 --> 04:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
what the committee feels is the best way
 
04:26:26.510 --> 04:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
to go forward at the end of the day this
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
is your bill now and I believe that any
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
form of language that respects the
 
04:26:34.610 --> 04:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
intent is language that I would support
 
04:26:36.769 --> 04:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
but the intent of this is to make sure
 
04:26:38.689 --> 04:26:38.699 align:start position:0%
that the people's right to make a
 
04:26:40.490 --> 04:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
decision about their own body that only
 
04:26:41.809 --> 04:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
affects them
 
04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
is respected you know based on that
 
04:26:47.870 --> 04:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
criteria so I would really not you know
 
04:26:50.269 --> 04:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
object to that potential expansion of
 
04:26:53.929 --> 04:26:53.939 align:start position:0%
the language to you know refer in a
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you other questions
 
04:27:00.649 --> 04:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
see no other questions thank you very
 
04:27:00.659 --> 04:27:04.070 align:start position:0%
see no other questions thank you very
much

04:27:04.070 --> 04:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:05.809 --> 04:27:05.819 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Virginia
 
04:27:05.819 --> 04:27:13.490 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Virginia
Sykes

04:27:13.490 --> 04:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:16.370 --> 04:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
yeah a few minutes ma'am
 
04:27:18.410 --> 04:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and honorable
 
04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
04:27:22.370 --> 04:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
hearing this bill today
 
04:27:24.110 --> 04:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to be speaking mostly about
 
04:27:25.790 --> 04:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
part c
 
04:27:28.130 --> 04:27:28.140 align:start position:0%
um I grew up in a family of doctors my
 
04:27:30.110 --> 04:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
grandfather was a physician as was his
 
04:27:31.670 --> 04:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
father before him
 
04:27:34.269 --> 04:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
and my uncle is also a doctor
 
04:27:38.570 --> 04:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
I grew up in the medical community and
 
04:27:40.610 --> 04:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot about complaints about
 
04:27:43.130 --> 04:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice and this that and
 
04:27:44.570 --> 04:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
the other thing
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
I've known since I was 16 I did not want
 
04:27:50.330 --> 04:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
children I I strongly believe from the
 
04:27:52.010 --> 04:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
bottom of my heart if you can't look at
 
04:27:53.929 --> 04:27:53.939 align:start position:0%
children and say oh my God I want that
 
04:27:56.570 --> 04:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
child more than anything they make me
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
happy they bring me joy you shouldn't
 
04:28:03.469 --> 04:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
have children and I could only even as a
 
04:28:05.750 --> 04:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
preschool teacher and many many other
 
04:28:05.760 --> 04:28:07.309 align:start position:0%
preschool teacher and many many other
children

04:28:07.309 --> 04:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:28:09.530 --> 04:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
I could never look at a child and say
 
04:28:11.450 --> 04:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
having this in my life would bring me
 
04:28:14.330 --> 04:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
joy would make me want them as anything
 
04:28:17.809 --> 04:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
other than a duty and so since I was 16
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
I've told my gynecologist I want to get
 
04:28:22.370 --> 04:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
sterilized now I say oh no no you're too
 
04:28:24.290 --> 04:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
young you're too young
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm now 33 and I still want to be
 
04:28:27.840 --> 04:28:29.389 align:start position:0%
and I'm now 33 and I still want to be
sterilized

04:28:29.389 --> 04:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
sterilized
 
04:28:29.399 --> 04:28:30.229 align:start position:0%
sterilized
um

04:28:30.229 --> 04:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:32.149 --> 04:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
because quite frankly the most
 
04:28:33.649 --> 04:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
horrifying thing I can think of is
 
04:28:34.849 --> 04:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
getting pregnant
 
04:28:37.250 --> 04:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
it is to me
 
04:28:40.429 --> 04:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
I would rather die than have a child for
 
04:28:42.769 --> 04:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
personal reasons
 
04:28:45.229 --> 04:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
I don't want them not only do they not
 
04:28:46.969 --> 04:28:46.979 align:start position:0%
want them I don't think the quality of
 
04:28:48.590 --> 04:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
life of a child I could bring to this
 
04:28:50.510 --> 04:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
world would be worth having for them
 
04:28:53.030 --> 04:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
because I'm on a lot of medications
 
04:28:55.010 --> 04:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
and I'd have to get off of it which
 
04:28:57.469 --> 04:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
would leave me in excruciating pain for
 
04:28:59.510 --> 04:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
the months it would take to have this
 
04:29:01.610 --> 04:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
child plus breastfeeding
 
04:29:04.250 --> 04:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
I don't see the balance
 
04:29:04.260 --> 04:29:05.929 align:start position:0%
I don't see the balance
but

04:29:05.929 --> 04:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:29:08.269 --> 04:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
one thing that's important here is I was
 
04:29:11.870 --> 04:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
told later in my life that to get enough
 
04:29:13.969 --> 04:29:13.979 align:start position:0%
to get a sterilization I would have to
 
04:29:16.790 --> 04:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
go through two psychiatric appointments
 
04:29:18.170 --> 04:29:18.180 align:start position:0%
and then three meetings with the
 
04:29:18.180 --> 04:29:20.030 align:start position:0%
and then three meetings with the
gynecologist

04:29:20.030 --> 04:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
gynecologist
 
04:29:22.729 --> 04:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
and I said okay why
 
04:29:24.469 --> 04:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
and the doctor said because I don't want
 
04:29:26.389 --> 04:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
to get sued
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
so I think the most important part of
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is in fact the legal
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
protection of doctors for sterilization
 
04:29:36.050 --> 04:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
procedures because then that list of
 
04:29:37.849 --> 04:29:37.859 align:start position:0%
four people those four people say okay
 
04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah no I know what women want what they
 
04:29:40.910 --> 04:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
want they're probably not going to
 
04:29:42.769 --> 04:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
change their mind those people that
 
04:29:44.929 --> 04:29:44.939 align:start position:0%
think oh well you know women they're
 
04:29:47.330 --> 04:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
very fickle and they change their mind
 
04:29:48.830 --> 04:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to have this legal
 
04:29:51.170 --> 04:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
protection now that they say okay look
 
04:29:55.010 --> 04:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
you can't sue me for sterilizing you
 
04:29:57.349 --> 04:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
they now maybe will get on that list I
 
04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
think the most important part is that
 
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
legal protection that will encourage
 
04:30:03.469 --> 04:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
doctors to take a procedure they might
 
04:30:05.929 --> 04:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
not have earlier taken because of the
 
04:30:08.809 --> 04:30:08.819 align:start position:0%
legal protections and I can answer any
 
04:30:11.870 --> 04:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
questions to that particular part
 
04:30:15.410 --> 04:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:18.649 --> 04:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions okay thank you
 
04:30:22.670 --> 04:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:28.790 --> 04:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:28.800 --> 04:30:31.790 align:start position:0%
 
everyone

04:30:31.790 --> 04:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:33.349 --> 04:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
hi everybody how are you
 
04:30:35.689 --> 04:30:35.699 align:start position:0%
okay uh so I just want to talk briefly
 
04:30:38.210 --> 04:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
on uh sort of the situation in which I
 
04:30:41.210 --> 04:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
find myself here I am in support of this
 
04:30:42.889 --> 04:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
um but I want to talk a bit about how
 
04:30:46.070 --> 04:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
the uh experience between a male uh
 
04:30:49.130 --> 04:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
getting sterilization uh myself and my
 
04:30:50.630 --> 04:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
wife was a bit different uh and and
 
04:30:52.010 --> 04:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
we're still kind of working through that
 
04:30:53.689 --> 04:30:53.699 align:start position:0%
but essentially
 
04:30:56.090 --> 04:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
um after our second child was born and
 
04:30:58.010 --> 04:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
we had made attempts prior to talk about
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh his directory for my wife and also
 
04:31:02.090 --> 04:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
vasectomy for myself
 
04:31:04.910 --> 04:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
um the the option for me to walk into
 
04:31:06.590 --> 04:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
the office two months after my second
 
04:31:09.170 --> 04:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
was born and get a vasectomy was simple
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
five minutes doctor said you understand
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
what you were doing I said yes sent me
 
04:31:16.370 --> 04:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
on my way I set up a scheduled
 
04:31:18.710 --> 04:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
appointment came and got it done she has
 
04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
been trying now to get someone to even
 
04:31:25.189 --> 04:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
think about doing a hysterectomy for her
 
04:31:27.530 --> 04:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
um for gosh as long as I've known her
 
04:31:29.769 --> 04:31:29.779 align:start position:0%
for about 15 years here
 
04:31:32.630 --> 04:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
the issue is more that getting the right
 
04:31:33.830 --> 04:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
people to
 
04:31:36.050 --> 04:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
talk with her and speak with her and
 
04:31:38.090 --> 04:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
understand where she's coming from and
 
04:31:39.469 --> 04:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
then understanding all of the maladies
 
04:31:42.110 --> 04:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
that kind of live with her she's
 
04:31:44.929 --> 04:31:44.939 align:start position:0%
essentially giving this issue to herself
 
04:31:46.670 --> 04:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
where she spends about a week every
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
month in bed in extreme pain a lot of it
 
04:31:51.649 --> 04:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
stemming from her period in her
 
04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
menstrual cycle
 
04:31:57.130 --> 04:31:57.140 align:start position:0%
and the remedy is to remove her uterus
 
04:31:59.689 --> 04:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
but the issue is you need to have
 
04:32:01.370 --> 04:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
children you're not old enough you got
 
04:32:02.809 --> 04:32:02.819 align:start position:0%
to wait have some children we had two
 
04:32:04.670 --> 04:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
children now it's well you don't know
 
04:32:05.929 --> 04:32:05.939 align:start position:0%
you have to take medicine for the rest
 
04:32:08.149 --> 04:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
of your life she understands that we
 
04:32:09.769 --> 04:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
both are in the medical field we come
 
04:32:12.410 --> 04:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
from medical backgrounds the key piece
 
04:32:15.290 --> 04:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
here is that we need to ensure that the
 
04:32:17.090 --> 04:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
Physicians are informing their patients
 
04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
and that they can then consent to the
 
04:32:18.720 --> 04:32:20.290 align:start position:0%
and that they can then consent to the
procedure

04:32:20.290 --> 04:32:20.300 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
04:32:22.729 --> 04:32:22.739 align:start position:0%
you mentioned signing the piece of paper
 
04:32:24.889 --> 04:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
right before you got your procedure if
 
04:32:26.330 --> 04:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
you could find me a physician who can
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
give you a piece of paper and do a
 
04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
procedure same day please let me know
 
04:32:31.370 --> 04:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
who it is because uh that is few and far
 
04:32:33.290 --> 04:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
between nowadays usually we're booking
 
04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
six months out out so a patient would
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
have to understand exactly what they're
 
04:32:39.889 --> 04:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
signing up to do prior to any sort of
 
04:32:42.530 --> 04:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
scheduling because obviously cash is
 
04:32:44.689 --> 04:32:44.699 align:start position:0%
King and unless they can pay for it and
 
04:32:46.550 --> 04:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
understand what they're paying for they
 
04:32:47.929 --> 04:32:47.939 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even be considered to have this
 
04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
procedure done so again it's very
 
04:32:54.349 --> 04:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
important that we allow people to get
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
these decisions or get into the hands of
 
04:32:58.610 --> 04:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
the right people who can help them when
 
04:33:00.590 --> 04:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
they are unavailable to them
 
04:33:02.990 --> 04:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
and that's all I had to say thank you
 
04:33:05.869 --> 04:33:05.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:11.689 --> 04:33:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:13.730 --> 04:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Jennifer
 
04:33:25.970 --> 04:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
three minutes ma'am
 
04:33:29.810 --> 04:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
I timed it I'm right on the dot there
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:36.769 --> 04:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Jen uh and I'm in support of this
 
04:33:36.779 --> 04:33:38.209 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Jen uh and I'm in support of this
bill

04:33:38.209 --> 04:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:33:38.219 --> 04:33:40.250 align:start position:0%
bill
um

04:33:40.250 --> 04:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:42.170 --> 04:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
for the simple fact that the idea that
 
04:33:43.849 --> 04:33:43.859 align:start position:0%
we live in a society where the medical
 
04:33:46.490 --> 04:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
field pushes biological Parenthood above
 
04:33:48.590 --> 04:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
everything else such as pain and quality
 
04:33:51.830 --> 04:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
of life is incredibly troubling
 
04:33:53.209 --> 04:33:53.219 align:start position:0%
especially when they're a medically
 
04:33:55.551 --> 04:33:55.561 align:start position:0%
proven benefits of individuals having
 
04:33:57.109 --> 04:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
the right to make their own biological
 
04:34:00.410 --> 04:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
decisions around their medical decisions
 
04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
personally I'm surprised I haven't
 
04:34:03.470 --> 04:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
ruined my liver with the amount of
 
04:34:05.570 --> 04:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
Tylenol and Midol I consume every month
 
04:34:07.369 --> 04:34:07.379 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to make the crippling pain
 
04:34:09.470 --> 04:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
manageable which I'm sure several people
 
04:34:11.510 --> 04:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
can relate with
 
04:34:13.551 --> 04:34:13.561 align:start position:0%
it isn't just the unpredictable and
 
04:34:15.289 --> 04:34:15.299 align:start position:0%
inconvenient bleeding that wreaks havoc
 
04:34:17.150 --> 04:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
on our quality of life it's a sudden
 
04:34:18.890 --> 04:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
Rush of hormones that change the anatomy
 
04:34:20.449 --> 04:34:20.459 align:start position:0%
of our bodies and deplete our bodies of
 
04:34:23.090 --> 04:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
energy it's the debilitating and literal
 
04:34:24.890 --> 04:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
blinding migraines the bone deep back
 
04:34:27.289 --> 04:34:27.299 align:start position:0%
pain the nausea and vomiting among many
 
04:34:29.869 --> 04:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
other menstrual cycle symptoms
 
04:34:31.970 --> 04:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
when I was in my early 20s I was
 
04:34:34.189 --> 04:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with endometriosis which is a
 
04:34:35.869 --> 04:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
disease that causes the uterine lining
 
04:34:37.970 --> 04:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
to grow outside of the uterus the pain
 
04:34:39.910 --> 04:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
from this disease is Indescribable
 
04:34:42.529 --> 04:34:42.539 align:start position:0%
constant and especially bad during my
 
04:34:42.539 --> 04:34:45.830 align:start position:0%
constant and especially bad during my
cycle

04:34:45.830 --> 04:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:45.840 --> 04:34:46.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:34:46.670 --> 04:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:48.529 --> 04:34:48.539 align:start position:0%
when I tell you that my pain tolerance
 
04:34:50.510 --> 04:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
is high I'm not joking I've woken up in
 
04:34:52.369 --> 04:34:52.379 align:start position:0%
the middle of two surgeries and opted to
 
04:34:55.010 --> 04:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
stay awake to watch the procedure I
 
04:34:57.470 --> 04:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
don't know why
 
04:34:59.510 --> 04:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
um so when I tell you that the sudden
 
04:35:01.609 --> 04:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
sharp pain that hits without warning can
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
drop me to my knees in less than a
 
04:35:04.609 --> 04:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
second you can rest assured that the
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
pain is not exaggerated
 
04:35:08.209 --> 04:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
it's hard to reach your potential in
 
04:35:10.010 --> 04:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
being a functioning member of society
 
04:35:11.869 --> 04:35:11.879 align:start position:0%
when many of us only experience two
 
04:35:13.609 --> 04:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
weeks a month that are not consumed by
 
04:35:15.470 --> 04:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
the debilitating symptoms that accompany
 
04:35:16.849 --> 04:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
a menstrual cycle
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
especially when they're as severe as
 
04:35:20.689 --> 04:35:20.699 align:start position:0%
many women experience
 
04:35:23.090 --> 04:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
the easiest solution for many is a
 
04:35:23.100 --> 04:35:24.410 align:start position:0%
the easiest solution for many is a
hysterectomy

04:35:24.410 --> 04:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
hysterectomy
 
04:35:26.510 --> 04:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
for many birth control is not an option
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
many times the risks outweigh the
 
04:35:30.890 --> 04:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
benefits but when women seek to have a
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
procedure such as a hysterectomy we are
 
04:35:34.970 --> 04:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
told no and asked but what if you want
 
04:35:36.709 --> 04:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
children someday which is a question I'm
 
04:35:37.849 --> 04:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
sure is weighed heavily on the
 
04:35:41.449 --> 04:35:41.459 align:start position:0%
individual who is seeking sterilization
 
04:35:43.429 --> 04:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
when the chronic pain prevents us from
 
04:35:44.990 --> 04:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
living children are often the last
 
04:35:46.849 --> 04:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
priority on our minds or we're so
 
04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
desperate to better our quality of life
 
04:35:49.910 --> 04:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
we're willing to push our dreams of
 
04:35:52.609 --> 04:35:52.619 align:start position:0%
giving birth aside just for any sense of
 
04:35:52.619 --> 04:35:53.650 align:start position:0%
giving birth aside just for any sense of
relief

04:35:53.650 --> 04:35:53.660 align:start position:0%
relief
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
how fair would it be to our children if
 
04:35:58.310 --> 04:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
we were only able to be present half of
 
04:36:01.010 --> 04:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
the time if we're lucky furthermore
 
04:36:03.650 --> 04:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
motherhood does not stop at carrying and
 
04:36:05.510 --> 04:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
birthing your child women who wish to
 
04:36:07.369 --> 04:36:07.379 align:start position:0%
have children are no less of a mother if
 
04:36:08.869 --> 04:36:08.879 align:start position:0%
they adopt
 
04:36:10.670 --> 04:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
when doctors try convincing us that the
 
04:36:12.289 --> 04:36:12.299 align:start position:0%
most important thing is prioritizing the
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
preservation of fertility we are being
 
04:36:16.010 --> 04:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
gaslit and denied basic human rights
 
04:36:18.051 --> 04:36:18.061 align:start position:0%
it's a response that is rooted in a long
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%
history of the medical establishment
 
04:36:22.070 --> 04:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
trivializing and dismissing pain
 
04:36:24.590 --> 04:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
reported by women it also reflects the
 
04:36:26.449 --> 04:36:26.459 align:start position:0%
stereotypical views about the proper
 
04:36:28.131 --> 04:36:28.141 align:start position:0%
function of women in our bodies that our
 
04:36:29.390 --> 04:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
most important function is to have
 
04:36:31.010 --> 04:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
children and if we don't we are failing
 
04:36:31.020 --> 04:36:32.570 align:start position:0%
children and if we don't we are failing
somewhere

04:36:32.570 --> 04:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
04:36:34.310 --> 04:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
when I reached my breaking point I asked
 
04:36:35.869 --> 04:36:35.879 align:start position:0%
my doctor about a hysterectomy and I was
 
04:36:37.789 --> 04:36:37.799 align:start position:0%
told no I had a decision made for me
 
04:36:39.949 --> 04:36:39.959 align:start position:0%
without my consent a decision that could
 
04:36:41.869 --> 04:36:41.879 align:start position:0%
have made the last 22 years of my life a
 
04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
lot more pain-free and enjoyable and a
 
04:36:45.529 --> 04:36:45.539 align:start position:0%
decision that would protect me from the
 
04:36:47.330 --> 04:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
ovarian and cervical cancer that runs
 
04:36:50.209 --> 04:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:51.830 --> 04:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
I still don't have children and I would
 
04:36:53.349 --> 04:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
be okay with not carrying a child
 
04:36:55.131 --> 04:36:55.141 align:start position:0%
adoption has always been a welcome
 
04:36:56.929 --> 04:36:56.939 align:start position:0%
option for my husband and I in a route I
 
04:36:58.910 --> 04:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
would happily travel if I were able to
 
04:37:00.830 --> 04:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
make the decision to have a hysterectomy
 
04:37:00.840 --> 04:37:02.510 align:start position:0%
make the decision to have a hysterectomy
myself

04:37:02.510 --> 04:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
myself
 
04:37:03.949 --> 04:37:03.959 align:start position:0%
we're a state in which we proudly
 
04:37:05.570 --> 04:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
showcase our model of Live Free or Die
 
04:37:07.490 --> 04:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
yet every citizens in New Hampshire
 
04:37:09.410 --> 04:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
especially women are not given the right
 
04:37:10.789 --> 04:37:10.799 align:start position:0%
to live freely and make our own medical
 
04:37:10.799 --> 04:37:13.131 align:start position:0%
to live freely and make our own medical
decisions

04:37:13.131 --> 04:37:13.141 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
04:37:15.650 --> 04:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
and that is all I have
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:37:18.890 --> 04:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative McLean thank you Mr chair
 
04:37:23.570 --> 04:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question would
 
04:37:25.730 --> 04:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
would you be comfortable I'll ask you
 
04:37:27.590 --> 04:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
the same question I asked a co-sponsor
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
would you be comfortable if the
 
04:37:32.869 --> 04:37:32.879 align:start position:0%
legislation was amended so that if you
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
were to go to the doctor and they're
 
04:37:36.410 --> 04:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
really not comfortable giving that
 
04:37:39.709 --> 04:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
procedure that okay I can't
 
04:37:42.410 --> 04:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh do that for you but I can refer you
 
04:37:45.109 --> 04:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
to somebody who will so if we move that
 
04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
language into the top part of the bill
 
04:37:48.170 --> 04:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
would you be comfortable with that
 
04:37:48.180 --> 04:37:50.269 align:start position:0%
would you be comfortable with that
Amendment

04:37:50.269 --> 04:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:37:52.789 --> 04:37:52.799 align:start position:0%
um I personally would be I think as
 
04:37:54.529 --> 04:37:54.539 align:start position:0%
mentioned before there aren't many
 
04:37:57.730 --> 04:37:57.740 align:start position:0%
options out there so as long as the
 
04:38:00.590 --> 04:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
if as long as the
 
04:38:00.600 --> 04:38:01.310 align:start position:0%
if as long as the

the doctor the surgeon was
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
willing to do the the procedure yes I
 
04:38:08.869 --> 04:38:08.879 align:start position:0%
would be more comfortable with that
 
04:38:11.330 --> 04:38:11.340 align:start position:0%
being there thank you
 
04:38:14.269 --> 04:38:14.279 align:start position:0%

04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:31.070 --> 04:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
you have three minutes good afternoon
 
04:38:33.709 --> 04:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
everyone thank you for having me today
 
04:38:36.289 --> 04:38:36.299 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to talk in support and
 
04:38:38.150 --> 04:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
about something very personal and a
 
04:38:39.650 --> 04:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
story that I don't often share with
 
04:38:41.150 --> 04:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
people especially a room full of
 
04:38:41.160 --> 04:38:42.410 align:start position:0%
people especially a room full of
strangers

04:38:42.410 --> 04:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
strangers
 
04:38:45.051 --> 04:38:45.061 align:start position:0%
and that story is my health history and
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
the decisions that I have made for my
 
04:38:49.189 --> 04:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
body and my future because of that
 
04:38:49.199 --> 04:38:50.209 align:start position:0%
body and my future because of that
history

04:38:50.209 --> 04:38:50.219 align:start position:0%
history
 
04:38:52.250 --> 04:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
when I was two years old my family and I
 
04:38:53.810 --> 04:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
discovered that I had a blood disorder
 
04:38:56.449 --> 04:38:56.459 align:start position:0%
called spherocytosis it's where my red
 
04:38:58.250 --> 04:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
blood cells are spherical instead of
 
04:39:01.010 --> 04:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
donut shaped and my condition is a
 
04:39:03.410 --> 04:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
hereditary disorder and at the age of
 
04:39:06.051 --> 04:39:06.061 align:start position:0%
two I was it was causing severe anemia
 
04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
and fatigue
 
04:39:10.490 --> 04:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
and over the years as my body grew up I
 
04:39:12.890 --> 04:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
started to experience some severe issues
 
04:39:14.810 --> 04:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
at eight years old I developed
 
04:39:17.750 --> 04:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
gallstones and an enlarged spleen and
 
04:39:20.029 --> 04:39:20.039 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of memories of my
 
04:39:22.551 --> 04:39:22.561 align:start position:0%
abdominal area in so much pain that I
 
04:39:24.650 --> 04:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
would actually pass out from it
 
04:39:27.170 --> 04:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
so when I was nine I had my spleen and
 
04:39:30.289 --> 04:39:30.299 align:start position:0%
my gallbladder removed now when they
 
04:39:31.970 --> 04:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
were doing that surgery the surgeons
 
04:39:34.551 --> 04:39:34.561 align:start position:0%
discovered that because I had strained
 
04:39:37.368 --> 04:39:37.378 align:start position:0%
and clenched my abdominal region so much
 
04:39:40.670 --> 04:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
that I actually caused bilateral hernias
 
04:39:42.530 --> 04:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
they didn't repair this right away in
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
that surgery so after a couple of years
 
04:39:46.850 --> 04:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
of healing and my body adjusting to the
 
04:39:49.310 --> 04:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
first surgery I then had this hernia
 
04:39:52.368 --> 04:39:52.378 align:start position:0%
repair in my teens
 
04:39:54.890 --> 04:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
I had a few years of Peace in terms of
 
04:39:57.470 --> 04:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
my health issues until I hit my early
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
20s when I was diagnosed with stage two
 
04:40:02.810 --> 04:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
Hodgkin's lymphoma a blood cancer that
 
04:40:05.270 --> 04:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
for my age range at the time was a high
 
04:40:07.130 --> 04:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
survivorship rate
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
before I began my abvd chemo and
 
04:40:11.630 --> 04:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
radiation treatments I was given the
 
04:40:13.970 --> 04:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
option to freeze my eggs
 
04:40:16.610 --> 04:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
and this was the first time at 22 years
 
04:40:18.288 --> 04:40:18.298 align:start position:0%
old I really had to start thinking about
 
04:40:20.448 --> 04:40:20.458 align:start position:0%
my desire to have kids
 
04:40:22.250 --> 04:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
we talked about the process of egg
 
04:40:24.170 --> 04:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
extraction and at that time with
 
04:40:26.410 --> 04:40:26.420 align:start position:0%
everything that I was going through
 
04:40:28.970 --> 04:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
anything else happening to me was just
 
04:40:31.610 --> 04:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
too much so I went with my intuition and
 
04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
I said no to having my ex Frozen
 
04:40:36.590 --> 04:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
and went through chemo and radiation
 
04:40:38.750 --> 04:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
and that decision really stuck with me
 
04:40:42.650 --> 04:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
because as the years continued I kept
 
04:40:47.208 --> 04:40:47.218 align:start position:0%
thinking and learning about how I would
 
04:40:48.770 --> 04:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
feel if I were to physically have a
 
04:40:50.390 --> 04:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
child of my own
 
04:40:52.970 --> 04:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
the idea of growing a baby inside of my
 
04:40:55.310 --> 04:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
womb and giving birth is not a beautiful
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
aspiration to everybody
 
04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
for some people it can be a very
 
04:41:03.288 --> 04:41:03.298 align:start position:0%
terrifying experience
 
04:41:05.868 --> 04:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
and so ever since then I led with my
 
04:41:08.030 --> 04:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
intuition and I said
 
04:41:09.948 --> 04:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
I led with my intuition when I said no
 
04:41:12.288 --> 04:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
to having my eggs frozen and I have been
 
04:41:14.208 --> 04:41:14.218 align:start position:0%
researching talking to doctors friends
 
04:41:16.850 --> 04:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
family and myself
 
04:41:20.270 --> 04:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
and genuinely considering sterilization
 
04:41:22.550 --> 04:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
and after seven years of this when I was
 
04:41:25.070 --> 04:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
29 I began the process
 
04:41:27.050 --> 04:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
what I was expecting to hear was much
 
04:41:28.970 --> 04:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
like what you have heard and will hear
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
today denial dismissal but I wasn't met
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
with any of that
 
04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
my doctor listened to my whole story
 
04:41:39.650 --> 04:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
told me the risks told me it was
 
04:41:39.660 --> 04:41:40.730 align:start position:0%
told me the risks told me it was
irreversible

04:41:40.730 --> 04:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
irreversible
 
04:41:42.890 --> 04:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
and we decided together that an elective
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
bilateral salpinectomy a tube removal
 
04:41:48.708 --> 04:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
was the best course of action for me
 
04:41:51.948 --> 04:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
and in 2021 I hopefully had the last
 
04:41:54.410 --> 04:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
surgery on my abdomen and I removed my
 
04:41:56.270 --> 04:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
fallopian tubes
 
04:41:58.430 --> 04:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
I like to say that I'm grateful for
 
04:42:00.050 --> 04:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
compassionate and understanding doctors
 
04:42:02.810 --> 04:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
who helped me get that surgery but it's
 
04:42:04.010 --> 04:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
not just them
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
I'm grateful for doctors who put the
 
04:42:08.930 --> 04:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
well-being of their Patient First which
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
is their job
 
04:42:12.890 --> 04:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
you could be wrapping up please okay
 
04:42:15.470 --> 04:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
because the only reason a two-year-old
 
04:42:17.690 --> 04:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
little girl was able to survive to the
 
04:42:19.788 --> 04:42:19.798 align:start position:0%
31 year old I am today is because of
 
04:42:22.310 --> 04:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
doctors who cared about their patient my
 
04:42:24.590 --> 04:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
life and my well-being
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
and to dismiss or to dismiss or deny
 
04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
anyone an elective surgery that could
 
04:42:30.610 --> 04:42:30.620 align:start position:0%
help them in their mental condition
 
04:42:32.628 --> 04:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
based on a preconceived future
 
04:42:34.850 --> 04:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
reproductive desires that a doctor
 
04:42:37.190 --> 04:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
places on a patient is inappropriate and
 
04:42:37.200 --> 04:42:38.750 align:start position:0%
places on a patient is inappropriate and
wrong

04:42:38.750 --> 04:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:42:41.570 --> 04:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'm here today to advocate
 
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:44.520 align:start position:0%

04:43:12.410 --> 04:43:12.420 align:start position:0%

free lifestyle Advocate speaker
 
04:43:32.410 --> 04:43:32.420 align:start position:0%
podcaster and most importantly a woman
 
04:43:34.670 --> 04:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
I'm originally from Maryland but I have
 
04:43:36.350 --> 04:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
a network of child-free women all over
 
04:43:37.910 --> 04:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
the world who are telling me their
 
04:43:40.670 --> 04:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
stories every day I moderate a Facebook
 
04:43:43.610 --> 04:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
group of over 10 000 of these women
 
04:43:46.070 --> 04:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
I'd like to begin my testimony by
 
04:43:47.570 --> 04:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
telling you a funny story that my mother
 
04:43:49.190 --> 04:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
always likes to tell
 
04:43:50.930 --> 04:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
when I was three years old I looked up
 
04:43:52.368 --> 04:43:52.378 align:start position:0%
at her at the grocery store and I said
 
04:43:55.010 --> 04:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
Mom I'm not having kids and she said
 
04:43:56.570 --> 04:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
well that's a funny thing to say what
 
04:43:59.330 --> 04:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
are you gonna do so I said I'm gonna be
 
04:44:01.490 --> 04:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
a working girl I'm gonna work at
 
04:44:01.500 --> 04:44:02.628 align:start position:0%
a working girl I'm gonna work at
McDonald's

04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
McDonald's
 
04:44:02.638 --> 04:44:04.190 align:start position:0%
McDonald's
luckily

04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
luckily
 
04:44:06.830 --> 04:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
I shot higher in my career path but one
 
04:44:08.270 --> 04:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
thing hasn't changed since I was three
 
04:44:11.990 --> 04:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
years old I have never wanted children
 
04:44:14.330 --> 04:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
when I was 14 years old I was diagnosed
 
04:44:17.150 --> 04:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
with endometriosis I was bleeding so
 
04:44:19.550 --> 04:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
much that I was passing out
 
04:44:21.530 --> 04:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
I started asking my gynecologist what
 
04:44:23.868 --> 04:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
could surgically be done at 15 put on
 
04:44:27.110 --> 04:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
birth control at the age of 12. 12.
 
04:44:29.330 --> 04:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
because my periods were so heavy that I
 
04:44:33.170 --> 04:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:35.330 --> 04:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
despite me begging him to sterilize me
 
04:44:37.430 --> 04:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
and give me the ablation every year
 
04:44:40.490 --> 04:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
until I turned 24 he retired without
 
04:44:42.650 --> 04:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
doing the procedure
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
when I moved to New England I went to
 
04:44:46.610 --> 04:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
another doctor
 
04:44:49.250 --> 04:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
she said let's try the depo-provera shot
 
04:44:51.948 --> 04:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
I went into anaphylactic shock from
 
04:44:53.090 --> 04:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
birth control
 
04:44:58.550 --> 04:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:01.128 --> 04:45:01.138 align:start position:0%
after telling my new gynecologist
 
04:45:03.410 --> 04:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
about those issues she once again
 
04:45:05.208 --> 04:45:05.218 align:start position:0%
suggested maybe you should try a
 
04:45:09.170 --> 04:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
I have found a doctor off of that list
 
04:45:13.730 --> 04:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
that Ellen mentioned earlier who will
 
04:45:15.948 --> 04:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
sterilize me except she doesn't accept
 
04:45:17.570 --> 04:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
my insurance
 
04:45:20.090 --> 04:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
so it's live with it or Fork up ten
 
04:45:22.610 --> 04:45:22.620 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that me and my fiance
 
04:45:26.208 --> 04:45:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:28.910 --> 04:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
I would also like to talk to you about
 
04:45:31.730 --> 04:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
how important the freedom to choose a
 
04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:37.610 --> 04:45:37.620 align:start position:0%
I know in my heart
 
04:45:40.010 --> 04:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
that motherhood is not for me
 
04:45:41.810 --> 04:45:41.820 align:start position:0%
and I'm frustrated that I am supposed to
 
04:45:44.288 --> 04:45:44.298 align:start position:0%
live my life sick with not only
 
04:45:48.530 --> 04:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
endometriosis but with a lupus diagnosis
 
04:45:50.150 --> 04:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
because someone thinks I don't know
 
04:45:50.160 --> 04:45:51.288 align:start position:0%
because someone thinks I don't know
myself

04:45:51.288 --> 04:45:51.298 align:start position:0%
myself
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
if I was 27 and seeking IVF treatment I
 
04:45:56.150 --> 04:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
would be encouraged
 
04:45:59.030 --> 04:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
if I was 27 and wanted to have a baby
 
04:46:01.610 --> 04:46:01.620 align:start position:0%
everyone would say congratulations
 
04:46:03.830 --> 04:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
but if I'm 27
 
04:46:06.948 --> 04:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
and want serious treatment to prevent
 
04:46:09.110 --> 04:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
something that could very well kill me
 
04:46:11.810 --> 04:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
because I also have lupus
 
04:46:15.050 --> 04:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:17.090 --> 04:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
Child free people think about the
 
04:46:19.368 --> 04:46:19.378 align:start position:0%
decision to have kids daily
 
04:46:21.708 --> 04:46:21.718 align:start position:0%
my partner and I touch on this topic at
 
04:46:23.208 --> 04:46:23.218 align:start position:0%
least once a week
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
we weigh the pros and cons we think
 
04:46:26.990 --> 04:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
about the future
 
04:46:28.970 --> 04:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
probably than people who simply have
 
04:46:30.770 --> 04:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
baby fever do
 
04:46:33.590 --> 04:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
we are teachers therapists scientists
 
04:46:36.890 --> 04:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
writers reporters doctors nurses and
 
04:46:39.410 --> 04:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
good citizens who by the way are the
 
04:46:41.270 --> 04:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
only group of adults in the US who are
 
04:46:43.610 --> 04:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
actually taxed into poverty
 
04:46:46.128 --> 04:46:46.138 align:start position:0%
and who do not have access to social
 
04:46:47.750 --> 04:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
welfare programs
 
04:46:49.550 --> 04:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
we are discriminated against by
 
04:46:51.350 --> 04:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
employers we are not given the same
 
04:46:53.270 --> 04:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
legal protections as parents in this
 
04:46:55.670 --> 04:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
country so all we are asking you to do
 
04:46:58.490 --> 04:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
today is the ability to choose for
 
04:47:01.970 --> 04:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
ourselves what we want to do
 
04:47:03.350 --> 04:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
I had a
 
04:47:05.830 --> 04:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
miscarriage I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant
 
04:47:10.190 --> 04:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
in September of 2021 because I have
 
04:47:13.550 --> 04:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
Lupus I
 
04:47:16.368 --> 04:47:16.378 align:start position:0%
started to go into kidney failure I went
 
04:47:19.610 --> 04:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
septic and had to have an emergency DNE
 
04:47:22.070 --> 04:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
as well as emergency surgery on my
 
04:47:24.590 --> 04:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
kidneys and now I will never be off of
 
04:47:24.600 --> 04:47:25.970 align:start position:0%
kidneys and now I will never be off of
medication

04:47:25.970 --> 04:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
medication
 
04:47:28.970 --> 04:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
I do not want that to happen again
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
let's start wrapping up please ma'am
 
04:47:33.288 --> 04:47:33.298 align:start position:0%
Parenthood is beautiful but only if you
 
04:47:35.810 --> 04:47:35.820 align:start position:0%
want it and the only person who knows if
 
04:47:38.090 --> 04:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
you want it is you
 
04:47:40.730 --> 04:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
my mother loved being a mother
 
04:47:44.208 --> 04:47:44.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:46.250 --> 04:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
I will stay Child free no matter how
 
04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
this hearing goes today no matter what
 
04:47:51.110 --> 04:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:53.868 --> 04:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
but you have the power to decide if I
 
04:47:56.690 --> 04:47:56.700 align:start position:0%
have to live sick
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
or if I can have the freedom to live how
 
04:48:05.690 --> 04:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:07.430 --> 04:48:07.440 align:start position:0%

um it's always been uh something that I
 
04:49:26.570 --> 04:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
saw myself doing in the future when I
 
04:49:28.010 --> 04:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
was ready
 
04:49:30.770 --> 04:49:30.780 align:start position:0%

04:49:36.590 --> 04:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
number of years we got married and when
 
04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%

doctor I'm ready to start trying having
 
04:49:41.520 --> 04:49:42.830 align:start position:0%
doctor I'm ready to start trying having
children

04:49:42.830 --> 04:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:49:45.890 --> 04:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
she asked me okay you need to prepare to
 
04:49:47.810 --> 04:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
go off birth control in order for
 
04:49:51.288 --> 04:49:51.298 align:start position:0%
ovulation to start back up and I told
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
her I hadn't been on any sort of birth
 
04:49:56.270 --> 04:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
control for at least five six years now
 
04:49:58.190 --> 04:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
and she looks me dead in the eye and she
 
04:50:00.530 --> 04:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
goes you've never had a miscarriage I'm
 
04:50:03.170 --> 04:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
like not that I know of and she goes so
 
04:50:05.208 --> 04:50:05.218 align:start position:0%
you've never accidentally got gotten
 
04:50:06.890 --> 04:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
pregnant in these eight years that you
 
04:50:09.050 --> 04:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
are not using birth control and I said
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
no and she said to me you better start
 
04:50:12.590 --> 04:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
trying now because you probably have
 
04:50:15.770 --> 04:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
fertility issues and I'm like huh weird
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
I thought I just knew how creating
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
children worked and then avoided making
 
04:50:23.868 --> 04:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
a child that way so
 
04:50:26.570 --> 04:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
my so I come home I tell my husband you
 
04:50:28.190 --> 04:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
know this lady saying that I might have
 
04:50:29.868 --> 04:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
fertility issues and you have to be
 
04:50:31.610 --> 04:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
trying for a year in order to get any
 
04:50:34.250 --> 04:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
sort of assistance with fertility
 
04:50:34.260 --> 04:50:35.510 align:start position:0%
sort of assistance with fertility
um

04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:36.948 --> 04:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
for me
 
04:50:41.810 --> 04:50:41.820 align:start position:0%
it was just crazy that she she this this
 
04:50:45.288 --> 04:50:45.298 align:start position:0%
provider this woman who who knows
 
04:50:47.868 --> 04:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
exactly how women's bodies work is
 
04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
highly educated has known me for years
 
04:50:53.448 --> 04:50:53.458 align:start position:0%
knows my background was acting like I
 
04:50:54.770 --> 04:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
didn't know what I was talking about
 
04:50:58.490 --> 04:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
that I was not educated enough to make
 
04:51:01.070 --> 04:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
real actual decisions for my body and
 
04:51:03.650 --> 04:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
couldn't believe that I could use
 
04:51:06.470 --> 04:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
a system for Family Planning that didn't
 
04:51:09.770 --> 04:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
involve chemicals hormones or surgeries
 
04:51:09.780 --> 04:51:10.788 align:start position:0%
involve chemicals hormones or surgeries
like

04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:51:14.448 --> 04:51:14.458 align:start position:0%
that that right there is why I think
 
04:51:16.730 --> 04:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
that this bill is really important
 
04:51:19.610 --> 04:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
because it's the medical gaslighting
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
that needs to stop I know gaslighting is
 
04:51:24.288 --> 04:51:24.298 align:start position:0%
kind of like a hot trendy word but it's
 
04:51:26.448 --> 04:51:26.458 align:start position:0%
it really is what it is
 
04:51:30.350 --> 04:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
um patients come in complaining of of uh
 
04:51:33.890 --> 04:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
symptoms or you know awful periods or
 
04:51:35.690 --> 04:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
not wanting to have children for
 
04:51:38.868 --> 04:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons genetic defects abuse
 
04:51:41.990 --> 04:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
they have experienced and just I don't
 
04:51:43.550 --> 04:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
know maybe not wanting to bring children
 
04:51:45.948 --> 04:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
into this whatever this country is left
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
because what are they going to have
 
04:51:51.050 --> 04:51:51.060 align:start position:0%
other than chemical spills and more
 
04:51:54.890 --> 04:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
doctor bills but um for me I think it's
 
04:51:56.628 --> 04:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
really important we pass this bill
 
04:52:00.110 --> 04:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
to preserve the autonomy of the patients
 
04:52:04.610 --> 04:52:04.620 align:start position:0%
and to give patients even the leg up to
 
04:52:06.890 --> 04:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
be taken seriously by Healthcare
 
04:52:08.750 --> 04:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
professionals from some of the questions
 
04:52:10.730 --> 04:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing from you guys today it's
 
04:52:12.890 --> 04:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
very obvious that
 
04:52:16.128 --> 04:52:16.138 align:start position:0%
um we regard doctors as the smartest the
 
04:52:17.690 --> 04:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
most intelligent they know what they're
 
04:52:19.128 --> 04:52:19.138 align:start position:0%
talking about they went through all the
 
04:52:21.770 --> 04:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
schooling okay that's great you could
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
start wrapping up please however these
 
04:52:26.390 --> 04:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
doctors are just like the rest of us
 
04:52:28.368 --> 04:52:28.378 align:start position:0%
they are overworked they're seeing too
 
04:52:30.530 --> 04:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
many patients and there's no way they
 
04:52:33.890 --> 04:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
can actually know and give time and
 
04:52:37.610 --> 04:52:37.620 align:start position:0%
research your your specific conditions
 
04:52:39.350 --> 04:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
04:52:42.708 --> 04:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
make that justify them right
 
04:52:42.718 --> 04:52:43.368 align:start position:0%
make that justify them right
um

04:52:43.368 --> 04:52:43.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:44.990 --> 04:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
I want to talk about something called
 
04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
pmdd which remember if you could start
 
04:52:49.850 --> 04:52:49.860 align:start position:0%
wrapping up please okay
 
04:52:52.368 --> 04:52:52.378 align:start position:0%

before my period every month I become
 
04:53:04.868 --> 04:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
deeply depressed I become
 
04:53:08.750 --> 04:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
suicidal I become the a complete monster
 
04:53:11.208 --> 04:53:11.218 align:start position:0%
I have two children I've already had my
 
04:53:12.770 --> 04:53:12.780 align:start position:0%

three minutes
 
04:55:01.310 --> 04:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
I can do it in two okay I'm concerned
 
04:55:03.288 --> 04:55:03.298 align:start position:0%
that this is this law is going to apply
 
04:55:06.050 --> 04:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
to boys and girls who are being confused
 
04:55:08.330 --> 04:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
about their gender told their in the
 
04:55:10.970 --> 04:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
wrong bodies and given puberty blockers
 
04:55:13.070 --> 04:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
and opposite sex hormones that will
 
04:55:14.990 --> 04:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
leave them sexually dysfunction and
 
04:55:15.000 --> 04:55:16.190 align:start position:0%
leave them sexually dysfunction and
sterile

04:55:16.190 --> 04:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
sterile
 
04:55:18.410 --> 04:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
although children might legally be able
 
04:55:20.270 --> 04:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
to offer informed consent for these
 
04:55:22.250 --> 04:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
treatments there's no way a teen much
 
04:55:24.530 --> 04:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
less a 10 year old can understand the
 
04:55:27.230 --> 04:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
consequences of these treatments we have
 
04:55:29.330 --> 04:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of detransitioners
 
04:55:32.750 --> 04:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
describing lives of pain and regret this
 
04:55:34.850 --> 04:55:34.860 align:start position:0%
law would only facilitate procedures
 
04:55:37.490 --> 04:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
that cause permanent damage to boys and
 
04:55:40.250 --> 04:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
girls many of whom have autism or other
 
04:55:43.128 --> 04:55:43.138 align:start position:0%
mental health disorders
 
04:55:45.410 --> 04:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
in other words it would establish a
 
04:55:47.208 --> 04:55:47.218 align:start position:0%
religious belief that were born with
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
gendered souls or gender identities and
 
04:55:51.590 --> 04:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
these not our bodies are our authentic
 
04:55:54.230 --> 04:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
selves and so our bodies may need to be
 
04:55:57.110 --> 04:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
modified for a different perspective I'd
 
04:55:58.010 --> 04:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
encourage you to hear the
 
04:56:00.410 --> 04:56:00.420 align:start position:0%

04:57:48.070 --> 04:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%

05:03:42.650 --> 05:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
Redland thank you I'll start over thank
 
05:03:44.090 --> 05:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair members of the committee my
 
05:03:45.530 --> 05:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
name is Dan Hines representing town of
 
05:03:48.590 --> 05:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
Bedford and I think we all agree that we
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
have a fundamental and human right to
 
05:03:53.208 --> 05:03:53.218 align:start position:0%
have children or not I think we take for
 
05:03:55.550 --> 05:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
granted that part of that is the right
 
05:03:58.310 --> 05:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
to access birth control however that is
 
05:03:59.868 --> 05:03:59.878 align:start position:0%
not an explicit constitutional right
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
it's not found in the Federal
 
05:04:02.690 --> 05:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
Constitution it's not found in the state
 
05:04:04.670 --> 05:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
constitution this bill would explicitly
 
05:04:07.190 --> 05:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
put in our state constitution the right
 
05:04:10.070 --> 05:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
to access birth control some might say
 
05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
why is this needed we already have the
 
05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
right to birth control I would say
 
05:04:14.750 --> 05:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
presently we do
 
05:04:17.448 --> 05:04:17.458 align:start position:0%
um but who knows in the future different
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights come and go at the
 
05:04:21.470 --> 05:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
whim of certain Supreme Court Justices
 
05:04:23.628 --> 05:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
so this is essentially a preventative
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
measure so that a right that I think
 
05:04:27.948 --> 05:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
everyone just takes for granted will be
 
05:04:29.448 --> 05:04:29.458 align:start position:0%
classified in our Constitution and
 
05:04:32.570 --> 05:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
cannot be removed from us I saw various
 
05:04:35.570 --> 05:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
polls recently and over the years ninety
 
05:04:37.430 --> 05:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
percent of the people consistently agree
 
05:04:38.990 --> 05:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
there's the right to access birth
 
05:04:41.570 --> 05:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
control so this would put it to it's
 
05:04:42.770 --> 05:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
because of the Constitutional Amendment
 
05:04:44.330 --> 05:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
put it to voters and I think it would
 
05:04:46.030 --> 05:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly pass
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
this bill is not an abortion bill it's
 
05:04:51.110 --> 05:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
medical Freedom Bill the reason it's not
 
05:04:53.868 --> 05:04:53.878 align:start position:0%
an abortion bill is because it um I put
 
05:04:56.090 --> 05:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
findings of fact and it does say it's
 
05:04:58.190 --> 05:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
the right to access birth control to
 
05:05:00.230 --> 05:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
prevent pregnancy
 
05:05:01.970 --> 05:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
um it's not the access to free birth
 
05:05:04.430 --> 05:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
control just the access to obtain birth
 
05:05:04.440 --> 05:05:06.590 align:start position:0%
control just the access to obtain birth
control

05:05:06.590 --> 05:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
control
 
05:05:06.600 --> 05:05:08.090 align:start position:0%
control
um

05:05:08.090 --> 05:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:11.030 --> 05:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
I think it's a just a common sense bill
 
05:05:13.810 --> 05:05:13.820 align:start position:0%
that we all outright that we
 
05:05:16.850 --> 05:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
expressly or inherently I think have
 
05:05:18.288 --> 05:05:18.298 align:start position:0%
whether it's in the Constitution or not
 
05:05:19.368 --> 05:05:19.378 align:start position:0%
but I think it needs to be in the
 
05:05:21.288 --> 05:05:21.298 align:start position:0%
Constitution it's codify that right make
 
05:05:22.610 --> 05:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
it clear that this is a right that's
 
05:05:25.310 --> 05:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
important worth protecting and that
 
05:05:27.050 --> 05:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
should be explicit in the Constitution
 
05:05:29.270 --> 05:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
so that it cannot be infringed in the
 
05:05:30.890 --> 05:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
future and I'm happy to take any
 
05:05:30.900 --> 05:05:32.090 align:start position:0%
future and I'm happy to take any
questions

05:05:32.090 --> 05:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:05:34.310 --> 05:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you my questions from the
 
05:05:34.320 --> 05:05:37.010 align:start position:0%
thank you my questions from the
committee

05:05:37.020 --> 05:05:38.750 align:start position:0%
 
wow

05:05:38.750 --> 05:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
wow
 
05:05:40.850 --> 05:05:40.860 align:start position:0%
you see no questions representative all
 
05:05:40.860 --> 05:05:41.690 align:start position:0%
you see no questions representative all
right

05:05:41.690 --> 05:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:05:43.610 --> 05:05:43.620 align:start position:0%

05:05:49.670 --> 05:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
up to testify on this um Bill and
 
05:05:51.110 --> 05:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative Reed did you want to
 
05:05:55.730 --> 05:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:57.470 --> 05:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm not trying to put you on the
 
05:05:59.090 --> 05:05:59.100 align:start position:0%
spot if you didn't want to I wasn't sure
 
05:06:00.890 --> 05:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:06:02.270 --> 05:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
honorable members for the record my name
 
05:06:03.830 --> 05:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
is Ellen Reed and I represent Newmarket
 
05:06:06.170 --> 05:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
in new Fields Rockingham 10 and I'm in
 
05:06:08.690 --> 05:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
support of this bill because I think
 
05:06:10.550 --> 05:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
you've already witnessed today I'm in
 
05:06:12.110 --> 05:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
support of patient rights and the
 
05:06:13.368 --> 05:06:13.378 align:start position:0%
ability of people to make their own
 
05:06:15.410 --> 05:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
decisions in their own life I kind of
 
05:06:18.170 --> 05:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
think that's the American way so
 
05:06:19.910 --> 05:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
is that our pink card you're holding it
 
05:06:22.310 --> 05:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
is Mr chair thank you
 
05:06:23.810 --> 05:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:26.030 --> 05:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
any questions for either of these uh
 
05:06:28.310 --> 05:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
they're both the responses the sponsor
 
05:06:31.670 --> 05:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
and co-sponsor of the cacr uh as
 
05:06:34.128 --> 05:06:34.138 align:start position:0%
representative who do you want to ask a
 
05:06:35.810 --> 05:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
question of
 
05:06:38.930 --> 05:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
representative Reed or okay I would like
 
05:06:40.910 --> 05:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
to get the bill
 
05:06:44.030 --> 05:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh my my question about
 
05:06:47.868 --> 05:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
uh uh about your expectation if this
 
05:06:51.410 --> 05:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
bill uh in future will create some
 
05:06:56.090 --> 05:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
mandates to fund birth control
 
05:06:58.670 --> 05:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
no I think it all it means is that you
 
05:06:59.990 --> 05:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
can't be denied
 
05:07:01.970 --> 05:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
we have lots of Rights
 
05:07:04.128 --> 05:07:04.138 align:start position:0%
so we have we have a lot of Rights but
 
05:07:06.050 --> 05:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
not all of them are guaranteed
 
05:07:06.060 --> 05:07:09.170 align:start position:0%
not all of them are guaranteed
monetarily

05:07:09.170 --> 05:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:11.390 --> 05:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative freshman
 
05:07:12.890 --> 05:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:07:14.750 --> 05:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:07:16.970 --> 05:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
um so I understand we do have lots of
 
05:07:16.980 --> 05:07:18.350 align:start position:0%
um so I understand we do have lots of
Rights

05:07:18.350 --> 05:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
05:07:21.650 --> 05:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
enumerated in the Constitutions but
 
05:07:21.660 --> 05:07:22.610 align:start position:0%
enumerated in the Constitutions but
um

05:07:22.610 --> 05:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:24.530 --> 05:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
most if not all of those don't require
 
05:07:26.510 --> 05:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
the labor of other people
 
05:07:29.628 --> 05:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
and when you require the labor of other
 
05:07:29.638 --> 05:07:31.070 align:start position:0%
and when you require the labor of other
people

05:07:31.070 --> 05:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:07:33.650 --> 05:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
um whether they want to do it or not
 
05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
it's slavery and I'm just thinking if
 
05:07:38.868 --> 05:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
there were birth control supply chain
 
05:07:42.288 --> 05:07:42.298 align:start position:0%
shortages and everyone goes to CVS
 
05:07:46.490 --> 05:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
demanding their you know
 
05:07:49.128 --> 05:07:49.138 align:start position:0%
um they're guaranteed right to birth
 
05:07:51.948 --> 05:07:51.958 align:start position:0%
control you know I I just see a lot of
 
05:07:55.070 --> 05:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences for this bill
 
05:07:57.288 --> 05:07:57.298 align:start position:0%
um well for you know especially being in
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
the Constitution
 
05:08:02.270 --> 05:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering what you know
 
05:08:05.570 --> 05:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
eventually if people in prison will say
 
05:08:06.948 --> 05:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
we have a right to contraceptives the
 
05:08:09.110 --> 05:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
state has to pay for it
 
05:08:11.930 --> 05:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
um you could see uh you know any other
 
05:08:14.510 --> 05:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
branch of government where
 
05:08:17.030 --> 05:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know we have a responsibility to the
 
05:08:18.470 --> 05:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
people that we're serving that they
 
05:08:19.730 --> 05:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
could say this is the right that you
 
05:08:21.530 --> 05:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
need to provide for me
 
05:08:23.868 --> 05:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question
 
05:08:26.510 --> 05:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
um I think the best analog for us to
 
05:08:29.090 --> 05:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
think about with respect to this is the
 
05:08:31.310 --> 05:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
federal Second Amendment you have a
 
05:08:33.530 --> 05:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
right to bear arms you have a right to
 
05:08:35.390 --> 05:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
your Firearms doesn't mean the
 
05:08:36.350 --> 05:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
government's going to pay for the
 
05:08:39.050 --> 05:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
Firearms doesn't mean that you know if
 
05:08:40.430 --> 05:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
there's a shortage that you're being
 
05:08:43.010 --> 05:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
denied your rights but no one the
 
05:08:44.510 --> 05:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
government can't step in and say you
 
05:08:47.930 --> 05:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
don't have a right and we can talk about
 
05:08:50.750 --> 05:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
other providers infringing on that right
 
05:08:52.850 --> 05:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
so it gets into some interesting as we
 
05:08:53.930 --> 05:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
all know there have been many court
 
05:08:56.208 --> 05:08:56.218 align:start position:0%
cases about what private entities can
 
05:08:57.590 --> 05:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
and can't do when it comes to the Second
 
05:08:59.750 --> 05:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment so if you believe in the
 
05:09:01.788 --> 05:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment then I think you have a
 
05:09:03.470 --> 05:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
good framework to understand the right
 
05:09:05.150 --> 05:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
to contracept
 
05:09:05.160 --> 05:09:06.590 align:start position:0%
to contracept
Ive

05:09:06.590 --> 05:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
Ive
 
05:09:11.448 --> 05:09:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:12.948 --> 05:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
05:09:16.550 --> 05:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
that changed it to not bear birth
 
05:09:18.470 --> 05:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
control but
 
05:09:24.050 --> 05:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
um self-administer birth control or
 
05:09:26.510 --> 05:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
shall not be denied utilize birth
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
control or contraceptives if I may and
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
this will be up to the chair um bring
 
05:09:36.948 --> 05:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor up to maybe I think he
 
05:09:39.890 --> 05:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
might be better able to speak to what
 
05:09:42.288 --> 05:09:42.298 align:start position:0%
language might be uh getting to the
 
05:09:44.270 --> 05:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
point of the bill that might make
 
05:09:46.368 --> 05:09:46.378 align:start position:0%
everybody happy representative Divine
 
05:09:51.350 --> 05:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:51.360 --> 05:09:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:09:53.030 --> 05:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:09:55.128 --> 05:09:55.138 align:start position:0%
thank you so the reason I put access
 
05:09:56.810 --> 05:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
birth control is I think that made it
 
05:09:58.430 --> 05:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
clear that it wasn't free
 
05:09:59.570 --> 05:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
um and I follow up with what
 
05:10:01.490 --> 05:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative Reed said I would equate
 
05:10:03.590 --> 05:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the Second Amendment um that yes if
 
05:10:05.390 --> 05:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
we can't access it that's not the
 
05:10:07.190 --> 05:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
provide this isn't depriving anyone's
 
05:10:08.390 --> 05:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
labor this is saying the federal
 
05:10:11.330 --> 05:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
government cannot ban birth control so
 
05:10:13.910 --> 05:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
if there's different language that's
 
05:10:15.530 --> 05:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
used out of support I just thought
 
05:10:16.910 --> 05:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
access was the best to make it clear
 
05:10:19.310 --> 05:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
that it's just not
 
05:10:21.350 --> 05:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
essentially free and one of the things
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
but also once we do have a
 
05:10:25.070 --> 05:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional um right as you know
 
05:10:27.590 --> 05:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's not the end-all um States or you
 
05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
know States legislatures pass laws that
 
05:10:31.070 --> 05:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
touch on those things and the courts
 
05:10:34.610 --> 05:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
apply the appropriate scrutiny so
 
05:10:36.288 --> 05:10:36.298 align:start position:0%
I use the word access because I thought
 
05:10:38.270 --> 05:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's most clear but if there's
 
05:10:39.650 --> 05:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
separate language that I guess everyone
 
05:10:41.990 --> 05:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
is on board with i would support that
 
05:10:44.448 --> 05:10:44.458 align:start position:0%
should not be denied
 
05:10:45.830 --> 05:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it just comes down to
 
05:10:49.250 --> 05:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
possessing without shall not infringe
 
05:10:50.990 --> 05:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
stay coming and saying no
 
05:10:52.730 --> 05:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
05:10:54.110 --> 05:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
05:10:55.730 --> 05:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just I just want
 
05:10:58.368 --> 05:10:58.378 align:start position:0%
to make clear we don't have a mandate
 
05:11:00.830 --> 05:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
against access to birth control right
 
05:11:03.170 --> 05:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
now do we no
 
05:11:05.990 --> 05:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
um and but I think all our rights follow
 
05:11:08.390 --> 05:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decisions
 
05:11:09.708 --> 05:11:09.718 align:start position:0%
um so there are a couple which is good
 
05:11:09.718 --> 05:11:10.850 align:start position:0%
um so there are a couple which is good
but

05:11:10.850 --> 05:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:11:12.770 --> 05:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
um no there's nothing
 
05:11:14.510 --> 05:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
I guess state law no there's nothing
 
05:11:16.190 --> 05:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
prohibiting it but I think it is
 
05:11:17.330 --> 05:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
something important that should be
 
05:11:19.190 --> 05:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
codified so going forward a certain
 
05:11:21.470 --> 05:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
different legislature might say yeah we
 
05:11:23.090 --> 05:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
don't like that right anymore I will add
 
05:11:25.610 --> 05:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
to that answer that and I just testified
 
05:11:28.490 --> 05:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
to this on the Free Speech in in
 
05:11:31.250 --> 05:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
College's uh bill that I don't believe
 
05:11:33.830 --> 05:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
in waiting until oppression happens to
 
05:11:36.948 --> 05:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
prevent it from happening we have a
 
05:11:39.110 --> 05:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
second amendment in the New Hampshire
 
05:11:41.150 --> 05:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution even though we have it on
 
05:11:42.890 --> 05:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
the guaranteed on the federal level we
 
05:11:44.770 --> 05:11:44.780 align:start position:0%
still have belts and suspenders
 
05:11:46.850 --> 05:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
protected that right on the state level
 
05:11:48.948 --> 05:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
as well so
 
05:11:52.430 --> 05:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah just a quick follow-up so are we
 
05:11:54.830 --> 05:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
aware of anything either in the state or
 
05:11:56.690 --> 05:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
in the country of people being denied
 
05:11:59.208 --> 05:11:59.218 align:start position:0%
birth control pills
 
05:12:01.368 --> 05:12:01.378 align:start position:0%
are you aware of that
 
05:12:03.410 --> 05:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
I am aware of birth control I should say
 
05:12:05.330 --> 05:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of a political movement that
 
05:12:07.788 --> 05:12:07.798 align:start position:0%
seeks to deny access to birth control
 
05:12:10.010 --> 05:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
has anybody been denied access to birth
 
05:12:11.390 --> 05:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
control that we are aware of in the
 
05:12:12.650 --> 05:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
country even
 
05:12:16.610 --> 05:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
I mean one could say the the employees
 
05:12:18.910 --> 05:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
that what was it Hobby Lobby
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
things things of that sort on the
 
05:12:24.230 --> 05:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
private level so yeah there are entities
 
05:12:27.050 --> 05:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
and organizations that seek to deny that
 
05:12:29.690 --> 05:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
and if they are able to control state
 
05:12:32.930 --> 05:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
legislatures or town governments then I
 
05:12:35.150 --> 05:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
think that they would take that action I
 
05:12:37.550 --> 05:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
guess I would just add it's presently a
 
05:12:40.190 --> 05:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
right that's the Supreme Court has given
 
05:12:42.350 --> 05:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
us so no States can't go beyond that but
 
05:12:43.490 --> 05:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
again that right because it's not
 
05:12:45.170 --> 05:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
explicitly in the Federal Constitution
 
05:12:48.948 --> 05:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
is it the whim of five justices
 
05:12:51.590 --> 05:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:12:53.510 --> 05:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions okay thank
 
05:12:56.150 --> 05:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
you both thank you
 
05:12:58.128 --> 05:12:58.138 align:start position:0%
I would ask if anyone else wants to
 
05:13:00.590 --> 05:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
testify but no one else is here
 
05:13:02.390 --> 05:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to close the public hearing
 
05:13:04.250 --> 05:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
on cacr8
 
05:13:06.590 --> 05:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
we have no other bills noticed with
 
05:13:09.708 --> 05:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
today so we are adjourned uh until next
