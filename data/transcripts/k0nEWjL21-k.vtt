that I we unable to answer today also I
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to note that we have about 60
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
pages to get through um so I know we
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
have a 6-hour block today with a lunch
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
break there is one duplicate slide that
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
is towards the end and I'll point that
 
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
out when we get there I also want to
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
know um as we go through this that we're
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at some numbers and
 
00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:13.879 align:start position:0%
you're going to be seeing some
 
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
differences between actuals and adjusted
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
authorized in 24 and 25 and then you're
 
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
going to see some significant swings in
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
26 and 27 and that's because of some
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
changes that we made in accounting units
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
so no huge um uh additional funds or
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
decrease in funds for our Bureau I mean
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
for our division in the bureaus so with
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
that I'll start um the as always uh the
 
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
department um has each division have a
 
00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:51.879 align:start position:0%
mission and vision statement and our
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%

brings hope and connection to community
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide and I have to say this may
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
seem just routine oh yeah there's
 
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
another mission statement and vision but
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
this takes lots of time and lots of
 
00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.039 align:start position:0%
discussion among our staff and um with
 
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
inputs from our stakeholders so every
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
services and then um sitting side by
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
side with that is the policy unit um
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
that looks and um assists across the
 
00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
that looks and um assists across the
entire

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
entire
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
division so we have a system of care I
 
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
know system of care is used a lot um we
 
00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
talked about it yesterday with the
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
system of care for children I know that
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
there are other areas of the department
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
that use that but it really is
 
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.550 align:start position:0%
that use that but it really is
addressing

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um care for people across
 
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
the lifespan and how do we do that I
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Contracting we have
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development training and
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
technical assistance um the oversight
 
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
and performance monitoring
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure development which was key
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
over the last several years to infuse um
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
the resources into making sure we have
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
the Bedrock upon which all of our um
 
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
services are built upon and uh policy so
 
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
we go through the Continuum we look at
 
00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:10.519 align:start position:0%
Community Education and awareness
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
prevention and early intervention peer
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
recovery which is something that is
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
really key and important to the work
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
that we do communitybased supports and
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
services and then we get to the higher
 
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
level of services that are needed for
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
more complex cases which include
 
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
residential treatment and housing
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
Services um no cuz I wrote my notes on
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
this um so then on
 
00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:48.110 align:start position:0%
this um so then on
page

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
five um we have our positions and where
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
six we start going into the accounting
 
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
units and um I'm going to probably lean
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
a little bit on Nathan when it comes to
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%

UNH in the office of the director um
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
there are no contracts that's where um
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
my me and my staff uh
 
00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:56.839 align:start position:0%
sit choose love you may remember this
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
program from a couple years ago um that
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
was transferred I believe it was in the
 
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
governor's office and then transferred
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
into our agency sits at the division
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
level and that is uh
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
Staffing representative Nano for a
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair uh Miss
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
Fox U what is the nature of the
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
technical service with UNH what what do
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
they provide what does technical mean in
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
in your world yeah um so they provide um
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh stakeholder um convening so
 
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
administrative functions and they do um
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
continuous process Improvement um when
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
they look at um the data and um some
 
00:13:47.069 --> 00:13:47.079 align:start position:0%
data collection for
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
us so would I be correcting it's kind of
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
a Consulting Consulting service yeah
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we call I think we use them
 
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
interchangeably so um I can try to
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
correct for that and and that what is
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
the what is the value of that
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
contract I I have it here but I'll need
 
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
um maybe during a break I can get it to
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
you and Nathan's going to look for it
 
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
you um so uh the next one is the
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid payments to New Hampshire
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
hospital and glencliffe the these are
 
00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
the federal funds where they land in our
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
account from um historic perspective um
 
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
and um do not stay within their somewhat
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
of a pass through and a place where
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
those funds come
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
compensation pay
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
up representative priest for a question
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman going back to
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
your program
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
um Choose Love Can you just Define that
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
what is that sure so that was a program
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
um that was established um in the
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
governor's office um under governor cunu
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
and it is a program that was born from
 
00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
the tragedy um in Connecticut with the
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
school shooting um and so the founder
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
was a mom um of a child um who was in
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
that um subject you know who was killed
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
in that um horrible tragedy and it's
 
00:15:39.309 --> 00:15:39.319 align:start position:0%
about um building resilience in
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
communities in schools in children um
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
and addressing how we can go about um
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
regulating emotions and um conducting
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
ourselves in a from a strength-based
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
perspective rather than um from what was
 
00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
viewed as a people perspective thank you
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on that when was that
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
implemented in New Hampshire that
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
it yeah I I was going to say um New Town
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
happened about so it happened shortly
 
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
after that so about six years ago but we
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
so this again is from a division
 
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
perspective about um the key
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
accomplishments over the last couple
 
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
years we have integrated crisis services
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
available so this isn't just to address
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
mental health but also to address
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
substance use
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
crises um so we have the New Hampshire
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
rapid response access point and um that
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
is the centralized location where people
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
can call for help um when they're
 
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
experiencing a mental health crisis or a
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
substance misuse crisis and it also
 
00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:11.799 align:start position:0%
deploys the mobile crisis units across
 
00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:12.669 align:start position:0%
deploys the mobile crisis units across
the

00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
state and you can see from the numbers
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
whenever we had data we tried to include
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
it in these uh in these slides so that
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
you had an idea of the scope um and the
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
reach of these
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
services and there'll be more data that
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'll be showing a little a little bit
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
later on we have rapid response crisis
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
centers so when you look at um the
 
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
crisis system you want a place to call
 
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
you want someone to respond and you want
 
00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
um a place to go should you need it and
 
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
so there have been two that have been
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
opened again we'll get a little bit more
 
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
into this um a little bit later on and
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
then we have um something that was in
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
the last few years that have been
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
developed which is the cold weather
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
homeless responses so these are um
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
either shelters or a way a community can
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
address the bitter cold winter months um
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
by opening warming centers and having
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
other options for people um experiencing
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
homelessness representative priest for a
 
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chairman and

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
um back to the rapid response crisis
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
stabilization centers how many visits
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
did you have last year I'm going to get
 
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
to the data it uh oh for the um the
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%

yeah yep they have just opened so um we
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
the other just opened a couple weeks ago
 
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
okay what about the cold weather
 
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
homeless responses how many uh people I
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
think I that data later in the deck okay
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah these um what we tried to
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
do here was do the highlights and then
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
we'll go into more details later on in
 
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.350 align:start position:0%
we'll go into more details later on in
the

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
presentation um so another key
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
accomplishment was we increased housing
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
options and supports as you know there
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
has been a real crunch for housing
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
across the board for everybody um but
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
despite that we've been able to increase
 
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
options for individuals with um a
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
behavior Al health condition and um
 
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
we'll get again these are highlights
 
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
we'll get more into the details of the
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
numbers and what types of housing as we
 
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.230 align:start position:0%
numbers and what types of housing as we
go

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
along slide
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
eight so I know that you've already
 
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
heard from Medicaid um as well as DCF so
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of information that they
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
shared that also um pops up here and
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
we've been participating with Medicaid
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
on um initiatives to improve access to
 
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
care and so there was an opportunity
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
through um our federal partner who is
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
samsa um as well as through the centers
 
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
for Medicare and Medicaid to establish
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
certified community behavioral health
 
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
clinics um these are um clinics that
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
have um the ability to to serve people
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
with substance misuse disorder as well
 
00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:36.039 align:start position:0%
as mental health we have and again we're
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
going to get into this a little bit
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
later on in the
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
presentation and there's a community
 
00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
re-entry which I believe that director
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
Litman spoke about um and that's for
 
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
having Medicaid services available prior
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
to someone being released from prison um
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
so that they are connected to the
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
community are more likely to um stay and
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
have Community tenure um with those
 
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
Support Services as soon as they um
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
re-enter the
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
community um and then we as I mentioned
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
earlier we have the infrastructure
 
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
Investments that we've made so the
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
one-time funds that we had um we were
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
able to infuse those into our systems to
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
um really be uh foundational as we go
 
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
forward um right now and again we'll be
 
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
talking about these a little bit more we
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
have an assessment going on for the
 
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
children's system of care we had um the
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
ability to stand up a crisis responder
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
certification program and so this was a
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
way to work with our um community
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
college system and being able to give
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
the training for the workforce that's
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
needed to as we expand these
 
00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
services and we also had a a peer
 
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
established representative Neno for a
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you madam chair
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Fox so could you kind of
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
describe what the peer certification
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
program is and and how does that uh how
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
does that compare to you know uh
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
professional certification or right so
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
um we'll get into peer Services um but
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
the peer certification program is really
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
to again and give credentials and ensure
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
that we have the quality that we want
 
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
and the delivery um of the workforce and
 
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
it gives options for peers for entering
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
the workforce and having the ability to
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
be a peer and be recognized as a peer um
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
in their
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
setting is that in addition to or in lie
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
of formal formal training programs
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
within the uh your
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
you all right so that's that's the
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
division perspective um and then we're
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
going to go right into the
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
bureaus so we're doing pretty well I
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
think I'm ahead of if I look at uh slide
 
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
count and the time we're doing okay so
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
um I know there was discussion about
 
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
this yesterday with the division for
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
children youth and families okay oh
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative priest for a question yes
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
going back on the uh peer certification
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
how are the individuals chosen for this
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh program they choose to enter yeah
 
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah just like any other um
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
certification program that you may want
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
to take and um be involved in is this
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
just with the state employees or
 
00:23:54.029 --> 00:23:54.039 align:start position:0%
businesses no this is for the Community
 
00:23:58.029 --> 00:23:58.039 align:start position:0%
Based Services and so it allows someone
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
um who is um a person with lived
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
experience to go through a training
 
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
program and learn how to um have you
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
know it's all like boundaries and how to
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
help somebody navigate a system it it's
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of that but it's really for the
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
communities and for our community based
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
organizations not for the state so you
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
just make the announcement that you have
 
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
this program and okay thank you yes yes
 
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.389 align:start position:0%
this program and okay thank you yes yes
yeah

00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:30.919 align:start position:0%
representative tarki for a question
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question it's just
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
it's occurring to me that although I
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
know about the peer support um are these
 
00:24:40.389 --> 00:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
peer counselors I don't even know what
 
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
they're what you call the mentors let's
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
say are they
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers they are not um so the idea
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
of the certification program is so they
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
can land a job in the
 
00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:53.190 align:start position:0%
can land a job in the
field

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
field
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
okay so Bureau for children's Behavioral
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
Health again I know you spoke some of
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
this um yesterday with director Nan
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
presenting and so some of it may be
 
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
repetitive and I tried to listen in so I
 
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
heard some of the questions that came up
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
and hopefully I can address some of
 
00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
those so on page
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
units and
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to think of where my notes
 
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
are not right in front of me for the um
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
contracts that are affiliated with this
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
2053 so so um one thing I should point
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
out is you notice there are only two
 
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
accounting units so there aren't um a
 
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
lot um and that um all of our contracts
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
care that's all out of system here yeah
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
so the um system of care care account is
 
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
where all of our contracted service
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
appear um and so we contract with our
 
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers we
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
contract with our um Care Management
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
entities we have New Hampshire rapid
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
response which I mentioned before um
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
some of the funds come out of this
 
00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:53.799 align:start position:0%
account and um our also our
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
residential programs for children sorry
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
I need to dial a friend here um and so
 
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
um I have 21 pages of contracts by the
 
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:06.919 align:start position:0%
way so I printed them out but rather
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
than fumble through those um I Look to
 
00:27:13.149 --> 00:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
Nathan instead um so that's where all of
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
budgeted representative walner for a
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
question good time to ask some questions
 
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
about the budget
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
sure so this is just a really quick one
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
but on on page 1000 I saw that online on
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
temporary staff during um this this year
 
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
and it goes away next
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
year yes those dollars will not be spent
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
um I believe I believe what this
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
represents is from HB
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
1573 there was a million doll
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
appropriation that was made and those
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
funds are non-aps and because of the the
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
timing and the work and effort that's
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
required to go through the process to
 
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
create positions and then actually hire
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
those positions and then given the
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
current status we don't anticipate
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
spending all of that so that money is
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
actually being carried forward into this
 
00:28:25.149 --> 00:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
bium but you're not going to see
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily those dollars budgeted here
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
cuz those those dollars were were
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated non-lps for
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
that specific purpose remind me what
 
00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:36.509 align:start position:0%
that specific purpose remind me what
1573

00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:36.519 align:start position:0%
1573
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
was so that is the oversight of the
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
children's residential and so that Inc
 
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
yeah okay yeah and
 
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
then when we go down to page 1 10,1 or
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
1,1 um in your
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
contracts have is are there any rate
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
increases for any of the programs
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
so um as we got through this um we can
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
sprinkle it throughout or we can do a
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
summary but there was a prioritized need
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
for rate increases for residential and
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
that was not funded um in this current
 
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.269 align:start position:0%
that was not funded um in this current
budget

00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:19.519 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry it was partially no no that
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
was in race yeah yeah it was the rate
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
increases were not funded um and uh the
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
other thing of note is that um I wanted
 
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:32.519 align:start position:0%
to point out because I I figured you
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
would um pick up on it pretty quickly on
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
that page of um
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
1,1 with the total amount in the system
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
of care in 2053 you see the authorized
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
adjusted 33.6 million and then it goes
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
significantly down the reason for that
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
is because that funding was for um
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
children's residential rate increases
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
from the last baym for the current BM
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
and the all of the uh dollars were put
 
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
into this account so this was a way for
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
us to have an account to deposit all
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
those funds to account for them they are
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
now budgeted in the appropriate places
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
so they're in the Medicaid budget
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
they're in DCF so we have not had a $10
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
million cut to Children's system of care
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
we've had um improved accounting for the
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
services and and this goes back to our
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
conversation yesterday where the team's
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
working on a crosswalk so that we can
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
give you better insight and and be able
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
to follow the bouncing ball so to speak
 
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:42.519 align:start position:0%
through the three separate account
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
units there I just have one more about
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
rates so providers got a rate in um the
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
bium that we're in but not into the ne
 
00:30:55.509 --> 00:30:55.519 align:start position:0%
there's no rate increase written in here
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
for the correct okay thank you and um
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
there actually is one reduction that I
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
should just note that the um children's
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Resource Center is not
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
funded in this budget and so there is
 
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
that um about a million dollars that was
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
reduced in this
 
00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:16.919 align:start position:0%
budget representative priest for a
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
question just thank you madam chairman
 
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
and just as a followup to the following
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
question what fund what was the
 
00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:28.870 align:start position:0%
question what fund what was the
reduction

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
yes so again um dispersement of the
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
about $9 million to other accounts and
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
then a million dollars for the
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
behavioral health children's Resource
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
Center that I'm going to get to when we
 
00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
you'll see that in one of the
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
slides okay thank
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
you representative Nell vano for a
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
question yes thank thanks uh Madam chair
 
00:31:51.549 --> 00:31:51.559 align:start position:0%
may maybe you're going to cover this
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
later but in looking at uh I'm looking
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
at page 11 on all the various services
 
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.990 align:start position:0%
at page 11 on all the various services
so

00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh kind of a sensitive subject that's
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
come to the FL recently is the whole
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
question of gender
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
dysphoria and I'm wondering uh how much
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
of that you're seeing and where it's
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
covered and how how that manifests
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
area so I'm not quite sure how to
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
answered as it pertains to um well the
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
first question is are are you seeing a
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
lot lot of that in terms of um uh
 
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health across the wide
 
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
spectrum of age groups and gender groups
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
that you see I would say when you look
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
at National statistics you can see of
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
who's at increased risk um for um
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
suicide um suicide attempts and um
 
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.669 align:start position:0%
suicide um suicide attempts and um
vulnerable

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
00:32:54.029 --> 00:32:54.039 align:start position:0%
populations that we see some of that
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
data um that indicates that um there are
 
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
certain people who um have have
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
increased risk and so I don't know how I
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
would label it other than um there are
 
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:13.880 align:start position:0%
some young adults and children who
 
00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
struggle as a result um and um have
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
those increased risks so just a quick
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
follow where does that where does that
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
fall in terms of the the wheel I'm
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
looking at on and and and how does that
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
um um manifest itself in terms of
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
referrals and other uh aspects of that I
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
would say that it falls in each one of
 
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
these um without any statistics to back
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
it up um I would say that um when we
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
start to see it um in as with most uh
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
communitybased Services It's when um
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
that you start seeing it on the acute
 
00:33:59.549 --> 00:33:59.559 align:start position:0%
end when when something becomes a crisis
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
is when we notice you that you know I'm
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
just talking in general not specific to
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
you all right I guess we're on page 11
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
um so this is um a a wheel I think
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
you're getting used to seeing these from
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
us as we go through the different tiers
 
00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:22.599 align:start position:0%
and we look at different levels of
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
services and we always start out with
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
the populationbased services and then we
 
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
um go through the wheel and have the
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
acute um side going all the way up this
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
has been something that we've used for
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
the children's system of care um pretty
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
much since its Inception what's really
 
00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
important to note is how many youth are
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
being served in community- based
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
settings because we hear about the acute
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
settings we focus on that but really
 
00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
most people are being served and youth
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
are being served in their communities
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
and as you heard from director Nunan
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday about all the efforts to keep
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh Children and Youth in their
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
communities through kinship care through
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
their families with family supports and
 
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
care representative priest for a
 
00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:23.079 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chairman do you
 
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
have an actual number for this uh that
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
you said 5% of the youth do you have an
 
00:35:34.589 --> 00:35:34.599 align:start position:0%
actual number that how many individuals
 
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
um we probably yes but I don't have it
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
here could you also find when you go
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
back to get that
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
number the number of you that you have
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
serviced in previous years to see if
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
you're getting out to the community and
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
you're making a difference yeah that's a
 
00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question when you
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
look at the data does an increase mean
 
00:35:58.829 --> 00:35:58.839 align:start position:0%
um is it good because we did a better
 
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
job of reaching families or is it an
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
indication um that we are somehow
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
failing to provide the services those
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
Community Based Services so it's always
 
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
great to look at the data and then ask
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
ourselves those questions as as we look
 
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
at it and we think about
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
funding but you will come back with
 
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
those actual numbers yeah and you're
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
going to see them actually in our rapid
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
okay um this one doesn't have a number
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
but it's it's
 
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
12 and this is looking and further
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
describing those tiered
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
services so prevention and uh early
 
00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
intervention we do the assessment and
 
00:36:48.319 --> 00:36:49.950 align:start position:0%
intervention we do the assessment and
evaluation

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
screenings um and those are looked at as
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
a universal way to um to that early
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
identification for
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
services to the far right you see the
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
Community Based Services and supports
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
those are tiers 2 and three and then in
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
the middle tier tier three as well so
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
you look at all those types we start
 
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
going from a populationbased approach to
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
the individual based approach and then
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
start looking at those specialty
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
services that are needed for specific uh
 
00:37:25.079 --> 00:37:31.069 align:start position:0%
services that are needed for specific uh
circumstances

00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
all right slide
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
13 this is the children's Behavioral
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
Health Resource Center which um we were
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
required to stand up and have done so um
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
that was under um it's now RSA
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
135f and uh this Center links children
 
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
families community members to um the
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
services and the provider that they need
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
resources that they need and um the
 
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
resource center also provides training
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
and that's what the center
 
00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
is representative tarki for a question
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
so so to clarify you said previously
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
this is not funded in the governor's
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
you representative n vano for a question
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair I just want to
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
come back to page 12 for a second and
 
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
and uh ask a couple of quick questions
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
on a couple of these programs what is
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
the fast forward program that is a great
 
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
question I shouldn't have glossed over
 
00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
that and again I think we have um some
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
statistics that indicate um more about
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
that program it is a high fidelity
 
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
wraparound uh service that is for
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
Children and Youth and it is uh
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
delivered in the
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
community so they're individually um
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
developed through a service plan um with
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
the family and with those
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
youth so again I follow up I'm I'm
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with a lot of the terminology
 
00:39:16.349 --> 00:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
yeah but what uh so you mentioned that
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
that ties into the High Fidelity
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
wraparound which maybe you could give a
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
couple of words of uh what that
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
translates to sure it's coordinating
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
everybody who's touching a family
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
and really getting them to all be
 
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:32.839 align:start position:0%
working together for the shared goal um
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
family so it's it's when we say
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
wraparound it's really not having a
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
bunch of different places where people
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
need to go but really having um that
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
care coordination that needs to happen
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
uh as people go through the and navigate
 
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.870 align:start position:0%
uh as people go through the and navigate
the

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
system and if I may uh one indulge me
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
for one more on medication manag agement
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
how uh exactly uh what does that mean uh
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
does that mean who who are you working
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
with or who you know what how are you
 
00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.109 align:start position:0%
with or who you know what how are you
managing

00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
managing
 
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
medications um so I'm going to have to
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
take that back because I don't know on
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
the ground exactly how that
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
happens I do know that um in certain
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances um in our community mental
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
health system the
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
um medications are dispensed um in a a
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
um controlled way um with a family to
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
ensure compliance and or adherence to
 
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
dosages and things like that but I can
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
get um more is it also working with
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
schools or you know because down here
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
you have educational and development
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
services is that the medication
 
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
Management in conjunction with I don't
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
know the school the school system it
 
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative walner for
 
00:40:59.069 --> 00:40:59.079 align:start position:0%
a question thank you so I heard you say
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
um Resource Center is not going to be
 
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
continued it's not funded in the next
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
budget right and I wondered could you
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
talk talk just for a second
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
about who is that going to
 
00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.790 align:start position:0%
about who is that going to
effect

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
and is the reason it was chosen to not
 
00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
be funded because it wasn't used or for
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
what reason was was a decision made that
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't fund it in the next budget
 
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
so um hard decisions are being made
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
about budgets right now so um I I um not
 
00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:39.079 align:start position:0%
really going to comment on any one
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
aspect of our budget and any reduction
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
um as to why other than we all know that
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
we're facing a shortfall and re in
 
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
revenue and that not everything can
 
00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
continue as is and so um what we're
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
thinking um as we go forward is that
 
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
this is a service that we could bring
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
inh housee should we be able to have the
 
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
Staffing for it um it's the maintenance
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
of a website what we lose is the um
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
provider training specifically um as a
 
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
result um
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
the resource center also is about making
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
those connections for families in
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
communities and as you will see we have
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
a campaign that was pretty successful
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
known as strong as Granite we need to
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
think about using such approaches as
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
well as um what we've used for 988 and
 
00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
rapid response um in going forward on
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
how can we reach families and we have
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
done trainings and we'll continue to do
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
trainings with our field staff within
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
DCF and um Juvenile Justice and making
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
sure that this information is available
 
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.950 align:start position:0%
sure that this information is available
for

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
families thank you representative priest
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
followed by representative
 
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:08.559 align:start position:0%
Stringham thank you Madame chairman um
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
back to the um the children's Behavior
 
00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
Health Resource Center how many years
 
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
was that in operation and how many
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
clients did you
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
serve so I don't I don't think I brought
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
the um stats on um the numbers but we'll
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
double check on that I think Nathan's
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
going to check on that hopefully for me
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
um it has only been um up and running
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
for less than two
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
years I would say I might be wrong on
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
that but front-facing from a community
 
00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
perspective I think it's been about two
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
years as a followup as another question
 
00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh on
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
page 12 do you have uh actual numbers of
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
individuals that you served in the
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
communitybased services and support that
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
you could share with us yes uh from
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
20124 and previous five years so yes if
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's not in the briefing book then we
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
you uh good morning director Fox good to
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
see you again thanks for joining us uh
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
it sounds I didn't see anything uh um
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know later on you talk about your
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
prior needs and what's been funded and
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
what's not I didn't see anything on
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
there on the resource center uh so can
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
you comment about if it was continued um
 
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
what kind of a budget appropriation that
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
that would uh in involve um thanks sure
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
and and so what we've what we've tried
 
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
to do um at at the request of
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
Representative walner is include all of
 
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
our prioritized needs um that were were
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
not funded in there um if if it were to
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
be funded uh what we had originally
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
budgeted was $1 million of General funds
 
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
each year so for a grand total of $2
 
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
bingum uh and um and and there's a
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
possibility you could bring bring that
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
work inhouse use uh either available or
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
additional staff perhaps at a far lower
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
cost is
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
that um I I would hope that it doesn't
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
come to that but yes we would um
 
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
consider bringing in inhouse because
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's required by state law that we have
 
00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:33.800 align:start position:0%
this Center and um we would ask for
 
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
additional resources to be able to do
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
that because as you know um the current
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
budget unfund positions um and so we're
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're having less staff um and so to
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
bring something in house requires more
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
staff um or at least a position to be
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
filled um the other thing is is the
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
um ability to um have
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
that reference technical assistance to
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
have that uh training for providers that
 
00:46:09.309 --> 00:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
is not something that we could do in
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
house so we would lose that um unless we
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
were able to contract with someone to
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
provide that and it's really about
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
looking at um programs that are of high
 
00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
quality and producing
 
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
those and just jumping ahead um
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh how many of the uh 60 or so staff are
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions right now in this
 
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
division sure so so I I I I would have
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
to manually go through my notes here but
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
I I can tell you for uh 20052 for
 
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health three of
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
the nine uh full-time authorized
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
positions you're looking at in in the in
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
the uh 26 27 budget are currently
 
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
unfunded and there's a total of 10
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
positions across the entire division
 
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
today representative tarki followed by
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth for questions
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you quick question um since the
 
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health Resource
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
Center is required by law do you happen
 
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
to have the RSA just from our notes or
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
is that asking too much I believe it
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
landed in
 
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you m M chair um that was
 
00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
actually my
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
question as a
 
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
followup did the governor's draft of hb2
 
00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
have to alter or defer that law in order
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
to adjust the
 
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
budget the the the current draft of hb2
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
does not modify that I I think I'd need
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
to take a closer look at the statute to
 
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
determine whether that would need to be
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
all right so I believe we're up to slide
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
15 is that
 
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
correct oh okay 14 sure 14 14 yep um and
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
this was just a followup on the uh
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
Resource Center um they have done
 
00:48:26.109 --> 00:48:26.119 align:start position:0%
surveys and um they've assessed
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
particular programs and and part of that
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
is this is just to let you know that we
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
are measuring and looking at the um
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
involvement of the Community Based
 
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
Services and what impact it has on
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
children and their families and um their
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
positive outcomes and so you can see
 
00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.309 align:start position:0%
positive outcomes and so you can see
those

00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
there we do have the statistics that
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
we'll go into starting on slide
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
15 so early childhood wraparound we
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
talked about fast forward before this is
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
the same exact concept but it targets uh
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
children who are birth to five and I
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
remember when we first started this
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
program everyone's like someone at Birth
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
how could you identify that they have a
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
mental health um condition and really
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
this is about that early detection and
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
early family supports and having um the
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
support so it's really looking at the
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
caregivers um and how um those
 
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
wraparound Services can help the whole
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
family um through this process so this
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
is a Medicaid um funded service so we
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
received uh approval to be able to cover
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
these Services um and this you can see
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
the growth over time what I'm going to
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
be showing you are statistics that show
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
slow steady progress and I think that's
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
really important because when we think
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
about fundamental changes to our system
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
um the idea of just flooding a system um
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
saying shutting down residential
 
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
programs and having them all go
 
00:50:10.789 --> 00:50:10.799 align:start position:0%
community- based would not be able to be
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
done on a dime it needs to be
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
incremental um as we go through and do
 
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
it in a very measured and capacity
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
building um and the utilization in this
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
steady way so this steady growth is
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
great from my perspective because we're
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
able to have the um proof of concept go
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
from 8 in you know in July of 22 um to
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
the the 63 um that we have um in January
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
and so um again I think it's a good sign
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
that we're um adding and continuing to
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
grow but not so rapidly that we're
 
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
overwhelming any particular community
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
service representative Neno for a
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
question yeah very quick question come
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
back to the ages birth def F so I I
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
assume that and if I'm incorrect that
 
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
that would apply to um mothers that that
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
are uh substance addicted and and and
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
then the question is how much of that do
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
you see and how how do you get those
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
referrals yeah so that's a great
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
question so yes that's a a very good um
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
description of um the situations that um
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
people are facing we have many um pcps
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
who will identify that so primary care
 
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
physicians um we have um hospitals that
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
are working with a family or come across
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
a family um we have you know it could be
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
a sibling situation um with a family
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
that's known to a community it could be
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
schools so there are many referral
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
sources for these programs and just a
 
00:52:02.789 --> 00:52:02.799 align:start position:0%
quick followup are so with all of the
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know uh evidence of uh problems with
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
all kinds of drugs in New Hampshire are
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
we seeing an increase in those kinds of
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
referrals or and you know any um kind of
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
numbers that you uh might put on that
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so um referrals you're seeing
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
actually numbers served we I'm not sure
 
00:52:26.789 --> 00:52:26.799 align:start position:0%
if we included it here but we also do
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
numbers of referrals um so that you can
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
see over time um the demand um for those
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
services and for the increased knowledge
 
00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:38.799 align:start position:0%
again we do those trainings and we do
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
that Outreach um specifically to our
 
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
field staff for DCF and um for Juvenile
 
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
Justice and others um but I don't have
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
those numbers here for the
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
referrals um but that is a good point
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
and that's um it's really important that
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
people once they have been identified
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
and they identify themselves as having a
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
need that we able to meet their um meet
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
that need so if you could provide at
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
least some rough numbers on uh that
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
particular portion of the referrals
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
would be interested to uh see that
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely and that's something that we
 
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh share with children's oversight um on
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis um and and can certainly
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
share it
 
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
here thank you
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
um and so page 16 is fast forward so
 
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
this is the population that um we talked
 
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
about earlier which is 5 to 21 and again
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
you can see that growth this program um
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
has been I'm sorry slide 16 15 oh 15
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
okay all right my my numbers are off and
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's why he had said do you want the
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
actual color copy so um so when I
 
00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
printed it it I'm off so I'm sorry for
 
00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
that um but this one's talking about
 
00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
fast forward so we're on slide
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
15 um again growth of the system um the
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
we've seen the growth in the referrals
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
enrollments this is delivered by our uh
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
Care Management entities and we have two
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
of them so that's why you see the two
 
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
uh I just not notice you know you have
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
different you know number sered since
 
00:54:41.309 --> 00:54:41.319 align:start position:0%
2015 other one was 23 does that
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
represent the start date of those
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
particular Services absolutely yes yeah
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
and so that's why you can see um fast
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
forward came well before the Early
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
Childhood wraparound which we recently
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
added um based on the success of fast
 
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:59.750 align:start position:0%
added um based on the success of fast
forward

00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
representative priest for a question
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chairman uh Miss Fox do
 
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
you have the referrals uh to the fast
 
00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:09.430 align:start position:0%
you have the referrals uh to the fast
forward

00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
enrollments we do I you uh provide that
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
you okay yes all set thank you okay so
 
00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
um the next slide I believe is 16 I'll
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
get back on track with this is
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
Transitional enhanced care coordination
 
00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
specif okay now I'm back on
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
track all right everyone I think it
 
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
knows where I am so the TR program um is
 
00:55:50.349 --> 00:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
how we refer to it and this is specific
 
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
for Youth and families um for the Youth
 
00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
who are transitioning in or out of a
 
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
residential treatment program or a
 
00:56:03.549 --> 00:56:03.559 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospitalization say at
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
Hamstead for example and this is the
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
ability for that oversight and the
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
coordination of care through that
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
transition process many of the services
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about and I'll be
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
talking about um later as well is that
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
those transitions are one of the most
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
important points of contact and uh level
 
00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
of service that are um make a difference
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
because that's where we lose people so
 
00:56:38.349 --> 00:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
to speak where um we um have a gap and
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
then um they get disconnected from
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
services so this program oversees the um
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
those Transitions and helps in uh making
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
sure that as those transitions happen
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
that all of the services are in place um
 
00:56:58.990 --> 00:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
upon uh discharge from a residential or
 
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
setting representative Daniels for a
 
00:57:08.829 --> 00:57:08.839 align:start position:0%
question yes as we look at this chart
 
00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559 align:start position:0%
how are we supposed to know how many uh
 
00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
out in or out that I don't think you can
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
figure it out from this so we will We I
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
can get that for you of how many um I
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
think what see is that they will follow
 
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
someone pre um entry into residential
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
treatment if they're identified um early
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
enough and then post as well um for
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
example if there is a youth at this new
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
news center um we know that they're
 
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
going to be there and so those Services
 
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
prior to um will be touching base and
 
00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
understanding um the family Dynamics and
 
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
the use situation
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
and that there are some touch points
 
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
when someone was is within that um
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
setting and then when they come out they
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
pick them up so that it's not just like
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
okay you're there they maintain that
 
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
contact UM throughout that episode so I
 
00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:15.039 align:start position:0%
think there going to be situations where
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
that happens and then there'll be other
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
situations where the first time we come
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
into contact with a family is when um
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
their youth or or child ends up in a
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
acute setting so I think you'll have a
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
mix of both and I'll see if we can purse
 
00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:33.559 align:start position:0%
that out for you okay and and I guess ju
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
just for your information what what I'm
 
00:58:38.029 --> 00:58:38.039 align:start position:0%
trying to look for is the success rate
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean you we've heard that uh
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
being being able to move them out of
 
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
residential into the community is more
 
00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
of a success but as I look at the charts
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
it looks like the numbers are
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
continually growing and you've presented
 
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
that as a positive thing but you know
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sitting here saying you know are we
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
seeing any successes you know I I would
 
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
think that if we were doing things right
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
that maybe we would see the numbers
 
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
start to go
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
down I agree and again it's really hard
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
to when we look at the data to uh
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
determine what we consider success
 
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
versus um what is not successful and
 
00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
that can be because um we've reached out
 
00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
to more families and there are more
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
families who are now Ware of our
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
services um or is it because um there's
 
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%
a you know there's a problem so totally
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
under I totally get it yeah thank
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
you representative Nano followed by
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
representative priest thank you madam
 
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Miss Fox for taking the
 
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
question uh we earlier touched on
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
briefly on the question of um suicide
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
and suicide prevention and so I'm just
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
wondering does uh uh does your division
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
track uh suicides in the context of
 
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
cases that you're you're dealing with uh
 
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.910 align:start position:0%
cases that you're you're dealing with uh
over

01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
time so there is a suicide prevention
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
Council that is established um by by
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
Statute and they issue an annual report
 
01:00:21.029 --> 01:00:21.039 align:start position:0%
um that has data um and it has the age
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
breakdown ages broken down and that
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
information comes from our chief um
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
examiner's office our medical examiner's
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
office and that's data that's pulled
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
together and so if you'd like a copy of
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
that report I can make sure you get it
 
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just interested whether we're
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
seeing a you know a lot of it a little
 
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
of it or and what the
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
trends uh look like yeah okay we can get
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
that for
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
priest uh thank you Madame chairman and
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Fox for uh taking my
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
question um I I would like to applaud
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
you and your department for reach for
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
getting more and more people who have
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
needs to come and seek and get treatment
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
for that how many referrals do you have
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
and how many people do you have to turn
 
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
away because you do not have the
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
residential facilities to handle them so
 
01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:20.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to get a little bit more
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
into the residential settings in a
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
couple slides um and you'll see that
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
how many referrals how many referrals do
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
you have uh for this particular program
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
so uh it's interesting because when you
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
say referral it's not just okay a
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
referral it's a screening assessment uh
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
determination of a level of care so
 
01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
there may be um someone who needs a
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
residential specific level or a
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
specialty service right so um so I'm not
 
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
quite sure
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
you've answered yeah you've clarified my
 
01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
18 this is exactly where we're going
 
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
next we're talking about Residential
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
Treatment this is a report that we um
 
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
issue monthly or we can do it point in
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
time and this gives you a sense of where
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
um our youth are and our children are in
 
01:02:30.269 --> 01:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
residential treatment um at at any point
 
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
so we have um the programs that are in
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that you're familiar with
 
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
um so there's Nation children's home um
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
do uh Spalding Easter Seals you start to
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
hear these names and you can think about
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
them as you think about your communities
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
and what services you have in your
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
communities so we have the New Hampshire
 
01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
programs and you'll see the numbers
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
there of how many uh Children and Youth
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
are in those uh facilities we have those
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
in New England and um primarily in
 
01:03:08.829 --> 01:03:08.839 align:start position:0%
Vermont Massachusetts and
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
Maine and then we have National programs
 
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
which we've heard a lot about um so we
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
have um as of the point in time when
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
this data was pulled in early February
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
339 uh children who are in residential
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
hair and then I can give you a minute
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
just to look at um some of the data
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
rather than reading it to you but you
 
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
can look at the age breakdown the case
 
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
type which you can tie back to um the
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
DCF presentation yesterday and then the
 
01:03:47.549 --> 01:03:47.559 align:start position:0%
levels of care um which go all the way
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
up to the um prtf which in New Hampshire
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
we have um a prtf at ham Hospital
 
01:03:59.309 --> 01:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
representative tarki for a question just
 
01:04:02.349 --> 01:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
a quick question about the um the
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
different case situations knowing that
 
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
our hope is to have our kids home um can
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
you just talk about what kind of needs
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
those eight children have that are so
 
01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
significantly far away like what are
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
some of these situations that require
 
01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:23.799 align:start position:0%
this um the one that comes to mind um
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
most um quickly is the um situation
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
where you may have someone who has a
 
01:04:33.789 --> 01:04:33.799 align:start position:0%
medical need um so they're medically
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
fragile they may have some type of
 
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
condition that isn't necessarily
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
controlled as well as the mental health
 
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
condition um so they have multiple needs
 
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
it's hard when we have a specialty case
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
to have a program a full program that
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
has um the ability to stand up when you
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
have one particular particular case so
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
if you think of some of the cases of um
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
and I really shouldn't Callum cases
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
their families their kids um their there
 
01:05:08.589 --> 01:05:08.599 align:start position:0%
are um neighbors um they have such
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
complex needs where they may have um an
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
intellectual disorder a mental health
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
condition um a physical um need some
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
type of
 
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
disability and there just isn't any
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
specialized program for that to address
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
that they may have it disorder is
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
another one that um we think of um so
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
those are really the um outliers those
 
01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
cases and it's really important that we
 
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
have a place for them to get the
 
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
treatment that they need and that's why
 
01:05:45.549 --> 01:05:45.559 align:start position:0%
we do have to rely on those National
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
programs so does New Hampshire have
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
equality program for eating disorders or
 
01:05:54.029 --> 01:05:54.039 align:start position:0%
do they have to go somewhere else in New
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
England that that's typically out of
 
01:05:58.589 --> 01:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
state that's too bad okay thank
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
you with regard to the age ranges there
 
01:06:03.549 --> 01:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
18 uh do you know if those numbers are
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
average in terms of numbers in those age
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
categories are they above average below
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
any idea where we
 
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
stand um so from a national perspective
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
is that your question I'm thinking more
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
in state
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
but it's okay if you don't I was just
 
01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
curious um especially in terms of the 0o
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
to four range and the 5 to 11 if those
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
were above average
 
01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:39.559 align:start position:0%
or yeah I I would need to get back to
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
you on that as you see most of the
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
population falls into that uh Teenage
 
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
population right 12 to 17 okay no
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
problem thank you okay representative
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
seaworth followed by representative PR
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um so you mentioned
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
the connection with this this
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
presentation with what we heard
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I certainly remember some
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
of the numbers line up if I'm now
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
thinking about the budget and let's say
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
I I'm looking at the cost for the eight
 
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
out of state is this going to be spread
 
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
among um different budgets how do I
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
connect funding to the kids rather than
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
Departments you want to be able to track
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
cost by
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
child and and not
 
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
in that makes it sound like I want to do
 
01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
more than I really want to do just when
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get my mind around the
 
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
total cost of this thing how do I know
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
that I'm looking at all the different
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
places that funds it so it maybe just a
 
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
high level of how the funding crosses
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
between departments for a single purpose
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
sure and and and that's that analysis or
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
that that compilation that we're working
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
on and again um to to katu's point it
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
it's based on the specific needs of the
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
child and what the child is eligible for
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
so if if it's if if they're eligible for
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
Medicaid then the service portion could
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
be paid for with Medicaid but the ren
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
board if they're not eligible for tanif
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
or fore then that may be 100% General
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
funds but if they're eligible for tanif
 
01:08:28.269 --> 01:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
then the ren board and education are
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
paid with tanif and potentially and then
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
but but then the services may be paid
 
01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
for with tanip instead of Medicaid and
 
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
so I I I have a I have a matrix that
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
that the team's put together over the
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
years to try to Simply explain that and
 
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
I think that's one of the challenges
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
with um with the way that that we're
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
currently looking at this and and we've
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
already started to have internal
 
01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
conversations around like going forward
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
in future years is there an easier way
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
that we can budget this to give the
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
legislature better insight and ourselves
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
better Insight in order to be able to
 
01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
track this consistently so you know
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
right now I'm anticipating a change for
 
01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
the next bium because we want to be
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
transparent and be able to demonstrate
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
this and that's that that's that
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
document that we'll have for you next
 
01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
week so I can try to get to your
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
question a little bit more directly okay
 
01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's exactly what
 
01:09:22.349 --> 01:09:22.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm
 
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
thinking thank you madam chairman back
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
to page um 15 is this for Fisco year 24
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
right yeah this is for State fiscal year
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
23 is what we have here 23 do you oh
 
01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
since 23 I'm sorry since 23 yep so if
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
you looked it goes from July of 22 all
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
the way through to January of 25 okay so
 
01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
it starts out in uh 14 so that's since
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
the birth of the program so of great um
 
01:10:13.149 --> 01:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative nello
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
for a question yeah it's just a
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up question to representative
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
seaworth question so his question was
 
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
fundamentally an
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
accounting uh uh question but um the
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
other side of this is I'd be interested
 
01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
to know out of the eight what the range
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know what the range of cost was
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
lowest to highest for that group of
 
01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
eight and that would that would
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
obviously you know have some correlation
 
01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
to how the accounting uh shakes out on
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
that you know without any identifying
 
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
individuals or anything but just looking
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
at lowest to highest and median
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh recognizing that each one of these
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
cases is unique sure that that would
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
probably be a large amount of manual
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
work because each each child is going to
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
have different needs they're going to be
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
Serv they're going to be potentially at
 
01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
different placement locations that have
 
01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
different rates and then you're going to
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
have a different mix of funding and the
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
start and the end dates are all going to
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
be different so one case may be for 3
 
01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
months one may be for 9 months one may
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
be for some other period of time so it
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
it it it's a it would likely be a fairly
 
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
in-depth analysis because as as Marie
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
nun and the DCF director was saying
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday we the the bridges system that
 
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
we use to track some of these expenses
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
for these children it came out in 1997
 
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
and so as I've been saying internally
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
that's the like the hate of AOL I mean
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's a very Antiquated system and we're
 
01:11:51.629 --> 01:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
working on revising that so we're not
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
able to pull reports in real time um
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
quickly to be able to get to that level
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
of detail it could be done manually with
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
with quite a bit of work well I I'm kind
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
of surprised with that because you have
 
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
a case number assigned to each
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
individual and costs associated with
 
01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
that case I would assume so this is a
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
very high level thing and and if you're
 
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
tracking it that way all you're looking
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
for is a
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
gross um uh kind of a range so I'm I'm
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
not sure I understand why I'm not
 
01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
looking for a lot of detail I'm looking
 
01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
really for high
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh numbers like like a sample of 10 well
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
there a sample of eight here I guess in
 
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
this particular case okay sure yeah
 
01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:41.990 align:start position:0%
this particular case okay sure yeah
thank

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
you all right um so page
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
19 so um this is the assessment that I
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier and as part of the
 
01:12:56.189 --> 01:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
road map for the Department we
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
identified the need to look at the
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
system of care it has been um eight
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
years or so that it's been established
 
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
and it was time to take another look and
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
see how are we doing how are we um
 
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
providing those services are we meeting
 
01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
the needs what are the gaps and um how
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
do we go about better coordinating the
 
01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
system of care um and so we have been
 
01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
working um to do that we have
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input and we will um be
 
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
getting a an issuing a final report um
 
01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
in the next month or so and so we look
 
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
forward to that and appreciate everybody
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
effort okay that um is the system of
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
care and the children's uh Bureau
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to move now and the reason
 
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
why that this comes next is because uh
 
01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
the children's system is served by this
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
service um by rapid response and
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
integrated services and so you're not
 
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
seeing a new Bureau show up here because
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
again it's part of the um division-wide
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
approach to uh crisis services for all
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
populations representative Stringham for
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
a question yeah just make sure I
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
understand all those different Services
 
01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
the five level residential treatments in
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
state out of state out of New
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
England uh all those things are
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
contained in those two departments uh
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
that we first went through and managed
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
by nine people three which positions are
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
currently uh unfunded and unfilled is
 
01:14:46.159 --> 01:14:48.149 align:start position:0%
currently uh unfunded and unfilled is
that

01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
correct yes um however um we do have um
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
the dcy F which is overseeing the cases
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
so um the ones that the uh Youth and
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
children are involved in we have DCF as
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
a co-partner so they're doing visits
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
with families and they're doing all the
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
work that they do in the community so um
 
01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say that you know six
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
people are doing all of this work I will
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
say for the residential program we have
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
three staff that are dedicated to that
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
and then as Nathan mentioned earlier um
 
01:15:24.719 --> 01:15:26.550 align:start position:0%
and then as Nathan mentioned earlier um
the

01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
um HB
 
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
1573 increased the um oversight for
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
residential programs and we had hoped to
 
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
have two positions created as part of
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
that um and as a um way to in the
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
interim is that we're um providing
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
overtime so that we can increase the
 
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
amount of visits that we have from a
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
quality uh perspective for those
 
01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:58.590 align:start position:0%
quality uh perspective for those
residential

01:15:58.590 --> 01:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
residential
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
settings representative tki for a
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
question thanks um yesterday afternoon
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
when we were having a conversation with
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
DCF I don't believe you were here but
 
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
there was a question from represent
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
Neno about um how do
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
we reduce the numbers of kids who are
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
affected and the answer sort of boiled
 
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
down to re family resources and syst
 
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
system of care um do you want to speak
 
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
on that with this program as prevention
 
01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
and getting ahead of situations before
 
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
they end up in the system absolutely our
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
division serves the community that were
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
all community- Based Services um the
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
idea of any Reliance on any inpatient or
 
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
residential program we want to reduce it
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
as much as we can we know that um what
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
works you've seen some of our statistics
 
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
there are other programs that are making
 
01:17:06.669 --> 01:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
a big difference for families um and we
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
want to continue those efforts double
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
those efforts uh we want to focus on
 
01:17:13.709 --> 01:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
what works and that's why we're doing
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
the assessment to determine what other
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh gaps we can fill at the community
 
01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
level and um there will always be a
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
population that needs acute services
 
01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
that needs Residential Services we can't
 
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
just make it go away and think that the
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
community can absorb um the the need um
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
and we need further training we need
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
further uh tools to be able to help
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
families um address the the needs of
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
ones okay so rapid response
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
um again we've talked about this quite a
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
bit I think um from the last bium into
 
01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
this bium and the program continues to
 
01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
mature um it is you know we call it um
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rapid response we have an
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
access point which is the phone number
 
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
that you call and then we have mobile
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
crisis units a lot of people think this
 
01:18:20.669 --> 01:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
is just as mobile crisis but they're all
 
01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
part of that uh program that is to
 
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
address um when someone's in an acute
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
crisis and so we have that access point
 
01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
247 call you can text and um do a chat
 
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
um there are initial assessments uh you
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
quickly get on the phone and find out
 
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
what the need is sometimes it's
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
information and referral other times
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's an acute crisis that does not need
 
01:18:54.189 --> 01:18:54.199 align:start position:0%
911 response um but is for that person
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
on the phone right then an
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
emergency um so the access point
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
coordinates when a response is needed so
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
they make the determination whether or
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
not there needs to be a mobile
 
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
deployment into the community um and so
 
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
that assessment is made um and then the
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
if needed um mobile crisis is deployed
 
01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
the 10 Community Mental Health Centers
 
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
deliver the mobile crisis Services it's
 
01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
a Statewide approach so that um you may
 
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
have for example in Manchester you may
 
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
have more than one need for a mobile
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
deployment um at once so at the same
 
01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
time so you would have your nearest
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
mental health center deploy their mobile
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
unit um to address that second so um
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
while we have regions we have a
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
Statewide approach to um the mobile
 
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
crisis response repres pres Nano for a
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you madam chair thank
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
you Miss Fox um I'm wondering if uh I I
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the little asterisk
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of page 20 that says the
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
crisis model is funded through state
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
general funds but then it goes on to say
 
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
is a requirement of the federal
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health block grant yeah
 
01:20:21.629 --> 01:20:21.639 align:start position:0%
so so yeah it's a little um confusing I
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
saw that this morning when I was
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
reviewing and I'm glad asset so I can
 
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
clarify um so it's required that we take
 
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
our block grant dollars that we receive
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
from samsa for our mental health block
 
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
grant and we have a set aside so they
 
01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
require they you know give us I forget
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
how much million it's in here um dollars
 
01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
but then they say of that amount 5% must
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
be spent on crisis
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
response so this is our spending um
 
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
meeting that requirement so we do have
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
General funds we have the requirement um
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
of the block grant that we spend that 5%
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
set aside and and we've referred to that
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
as as maintenance of effort requirement
 
01:21:11.709 --> 01:21:11.719 align:start position:0%
previously when we've talked about that
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
where we have to expend x amount of
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
General funds in order to continue to
 
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
receive the federal block
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
grant okay so so then
 
01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
roughly how much of the you know how
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
much of this is funded Federal money and
 
01:21:27.629 --> 01:21:27.639 align:start position:0%
how much of it is is general fund money
 
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
and how can I you know yeah we have that
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
um and it's in our contract um it has
 
01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:35.639 align:start position:0%
the spread of where that comes from so
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to get that for you um
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
primarily General funds when it comes to
 
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
the access point when it comes to the
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis response the deployment of
 
01:21:51.149 --> 01:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
the unit um that is more likely to be
 
01:21:51.159 --> 01:21:52.470 align:start position:0%
the unit um that is more likely to be
Medicaid

01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:01.709 --> 01:22:01.719 align:start position:0%
okay and then the third pillar for the
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
um integrated crisis response is
 
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere to go and this was um a gap
 
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
and a need that we identified pretty
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
quickly it's great that you can have a
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
mobile deployment but there are
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
situations in which someone you respond
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
to may not have anywhere to go from
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
there and so the idea is to have a
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
crisis center where someone can go for
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
23 and a half hours um otherwise you
 
01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
fall into licensing requirements um but
 
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
the idea is that you stabilize someone
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
there where they um are able to speak
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
with peers they're able to um have
 
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
someone help them navigate through the
 
01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.590 align:start position:0%
someone help them navigate through the
next

01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:45.719 align:start position:0%
step representative priest for a
 
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chairman and
 
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Fox um if are all of the
 
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
Regional Crisis centers equal in the
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
services that they provide and say if
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
someone from the North country has a a
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
crisis that they cannot handle do they
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
then uh transfer him to like Manchester
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
or NASA where the service would be
 
01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
provided so that's um a very good
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
question our 10 Community Mental Health
 
01:23:20.669 --> 01:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
Centers have certain core services that
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
they all are standardized and are
 
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
embedded Within our administrative rules
 
01:23:29.709 --> 01:23:29.719 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to um the challenges
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
that are faced especially in the rural
 
01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
parts of our state mobile crisis would
 
01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
be one really good example um we have um
 
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
had a differential response where we're
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
able to have um Northern Human Services
 
01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639 align:start position:0%
covers those counties um that um are
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
more remote and have much more travel
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
time and they also have five offices and
 
01:23:57.149 --> 01:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
they have so when we think of mobile
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
crisis you think of a unit and
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
everybody's together and they're all
 
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
together 24/7 in a van that's not how it
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
works they're on call and they're
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
deployed and so they've strategically
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
worked through that but it continues to
 
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
challenge all
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
right um and so I just um following up
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
on the regional crisis centers so we
 
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
have two that have been stood up
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
um the most recent was um in Plymouth uh
 
01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
by Lakes Region mental health and Center
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
For Life Management in Dairy um was the
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
early adopter and um they they are
 
01:24:43.229 --> 01:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
available um and these are not the full
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
model they're not 247 right now and
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
they're not the Staffing model model
 
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
that you would see um at the National
 
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
Best Practices but they are available
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
and they are staffed um and so they were
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
open

01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
okay page
 
01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
21 Madam
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
chair representative Neno for a question
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
yeah a a very quick question on the one
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
it says mobile dispatch and this is a
 
01:25:21.109 --> 01:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
crisis is that that's a private indivi I
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
mean one of your care providers in their
 
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
own vehicle or does it an you know is it
 
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
interfac with law enforcement uh and how
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
how is this system uh what does it look
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
like in in practice Yeah so um yes yes
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
and yes and what it looks like in
 
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
practice is individualized so it could
 
01:25:44.109 --> 01:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
be that law enforcement responds and
 
01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
determines that someone does not need to
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
have law enforcement involvement and so
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
they will call and a um a team will be
 
01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.750 align:start position:0%
they will call and a um a team will be
dispatched

01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
dispatched
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
um the again the idea that it's a
 
01:25:59.790 --> 01:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle and a van driving around that's
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
not how it works it's usually people on
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
call and then they respond from their
 
01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
homes or out of um out of their offices
 
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
if it's during the daytime um and so it
 
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:15.639 align:start position:0%
could be I know early on um it was
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
really interesting because schools would
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
call and they would have um a youth who
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
was having a a mental health crisis and
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
maybe Mom was working um and unable to
 
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
get to the school so mobile crisis was
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
able to go and help um help that student
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
um get through and they never had to go
 
01:26:38.109 --> 01:26:38.119 align:start position:0%
anywhere else they didn't have to hit an
 
01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
emergency room so they're all very
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
different in different situations um
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
some could be law enforcement involved
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
some could be school involved and some
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
could just be a family um struggling and
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
and needing some help and we have
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
protocol and um have worked out details
 
01:27:01.629 --> 01:27:01.639 align:start position:0%
when um with 911 so we understand if a
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
call goes to
 
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
911 um what would be needed for a
 
01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
response versus a call going through um
 
01:27:11.109 --> 01:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
988 or through the crisis
 
01:27:13.149 --> 01:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
line thank
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
you representative priest for a question
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman on this uh on
 
01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:20.270 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman on this uh on
page

01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
21 um you uh this information is from
 
01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
from July
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
22nd to December 24th and it's very
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
impressive of how many people you first
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
get contacts with and the assessments
 
01:27:37.109 --> 01:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
that you do and then there's then the
 
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
additional services that you Pro provide
 
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
to those who need them um do you have
 
01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
anything that shows or Compares this
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
information to other areas in Northern
 
01:27:51.119 --> 01:27:52.229 align:start position:0%
information to other areas in Northern
New

01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
England no
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I I haven't seen it if it exists so
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
if there are other states that have a
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
similar system and comparing our stats
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
to theirs I haven't seen that and again
 
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
this has just been created since January
 
01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:18.280 align:start position:0%
yeah all
 
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
right slide
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
22 so again this is just a further
 
01:28:23.639 --> 01:28:25.030 align:start position:0%
22 so again this is just a further
breakdown

01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
breakdown
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
we went all out on rapid response
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
because we had data and we wanted to
 
01:28:30.109 --> 01:28:30.119 align:start position:0%
show you
 
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
data um and so this is the breakdown for
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
17 I'll bring my water up and when we
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
take a break um so you can see the um
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
contacts the unique numbers served um so
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
you can see sometimes there are multiple
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh contacts with the same person and
 
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
family which we don't want to discourage
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
we think that's a good thing and then
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
how many um dispatches have been
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
requested representative walner has a
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
question so as I look at the three
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
charts it looks like about half of
 
01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
the contacts that come in to the um
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
original telephone call I guess um end
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
up being referred over so what kind of
 
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
skills who who who is answering that
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
phone and obviously being able to help
 
01:29:34.679 --> 01:29:36.070 align:start position:0%
phone and obviously being able to help
divert

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
divert
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
people yeah so we have a contract for
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
that um we have a call center um carolon
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
is our current
 
01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
contractor um and they are trained up on
 
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.109 align:start position:0%
contractor um and they are trained up on
crisis

01:29:48.109 --> 01:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
response um and um have you know backup
 
01:29:56.189 --> 01:29:56.199 align:start position:0%
as needed um and can tap expertise
 
01:29:59.709 --> 01:29:59.719 align:start position:0%
within their own organization as needed
 
01:30:05.109 --> 01:30:05.119 align:start position:0%
um and the um deployments really we are
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
going to air on the side of caution if
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
someone says they want someone we're
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
respond does that answer your question
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
fully yeah I just wondered you know what
 
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
sort of skills the uh people at the
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
other end of the phone had yeah they are
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
they're quite skilled in being able to
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
do this screening and initial assessment
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
and um we do um spot checks to make sure
 
01:30:37.709 --> 01:30:37.719 align:start position:0%
um that the staff are trained up thank
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
you representative seaworth for a
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much I just want
 
01:30:44.109 --> 01:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand what I'm
 
01:30:48.430 --> 01:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
looking at um the drop off from chart
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
one to chart two part of that might
 
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
be screening out the request on the
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
phone some of that as you said is that
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
the same individual or same family needs
 
01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
to contact multiple time so it's one
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
person served but maybe five
 
01:31:09.550 --> 01:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
contacts is it mostly one or the other
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
or is it just a combination of
 
01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
everything I believe it's a combination
 
01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
that okay so um so 22 and 23 are very
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
similar um the uh 23 is 18 and older um
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
and I believe if you look at this you'll
 
01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
see that the number of dispatches um for
 
01:31:41.950 --> 01:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh mobile response to the community are
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
higher for children and again looking at
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
um that airing on the side of caution
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
and the request um we try not to say you
 
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
don't need us we never say you don't
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
need us us if there is a a call for this
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
then we're going to
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
respond um many of the calls too are
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
resolved um through this contact and
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
initial assessment um through either um
 
01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
having the opportunity to talk through a
 
01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
situation and through you know a
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
referral um and may not be deemed what
 
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
you or I might call crisis but for that
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
person at that moment um is a need
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
and because we haven't hammered at home
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
24 and um this really looks at the 988
 
01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
system and the number of um calls that
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
have um been made and really talking
 
01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:54.280 align:start position:0%
about um the
 
01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
avoidance of having to go to an
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
emergency department which has been
 
01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
really really the the whole point of
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
this whole system is to avoid having
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
families having to end up in an
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
crisis representative Neno for a
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you madam chair this
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
this comes back I think the question I
 
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
asked earlier so there there are
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
988 uh uh
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
I guess suicide and crisis but no the
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
breakdown of that is you know um the
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
question I asked before was how many
 
01:33:36.109 --> 01:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
suicides and whether we attract them so
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
the suicide in crisis is you know
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
there's no distinction you don't have
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
any thing that breaks down how many of
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
these are suicide and how many are you
 
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
treating them all as as potential
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
suicide so I don't know as though that's
 
01:33:53.229 --> 01:33:53.239 align:start position:0%
a stat that we keep whether it's a
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis or it's identified
 
01:33:58.510 --> 01:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
specifically as I'm feeling
 
01:34:01.229 --> 01:34:01.239 align:start position:0%
suicidal um so I would have to check on
 
01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
that um but again this is really just to
 
01:34:09.390 --> 01:34:09.400 align:start position:0%
be in a preventative way to have a place
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
for someone to call should they need and
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
be in a mental health crisis including
 
01:34:17.229 --> 01:34:17.239 align:start position:0%
um if they are feeling like they're
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
going to harm themselves um but the
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
actual statistics about um suicides are
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
kept separately and and not through this
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
system just a quick followup the reason
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
I'm asking the question is one of the
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
metrics if if you've got a suicide
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
prevention program is you know what what
 
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
what's the number of suicides over time
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
and and is that going down or is that
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
increasing as a measure of the success
 
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
of preventing suicides absolutely and
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
and I want to get that report to you
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
okay so we are now going to the Bureau
 
01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
of Mental Health Services which is the
 
01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:07.870 align:start position:0%
of Mental Health Services which is the
adult

01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.510 --> 01:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
population so if we look at slide 26 and
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
we have representative priest for a
 
01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you madam chairman
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
and Miss Fox again just for a
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
clarification back on page
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
24 is this the total number that we're
 
01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
looking at that of of all the AG groups
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
from from December of 21 to the to
 
01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
January 25
 
01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
right yes okay thank you December 24 yep
 
01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
yeah all right
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
so back to the
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
budget which I think is what we're here
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
for today um so we have the Bureau of
 
01:36:07.149 --> 01:36:07.159 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services um it has um the
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
accounting units as you can see here um
 
01:36:12.669 --> 01:36:12.679 align:start position:0%
the first one the pro health New
 
01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire grant that Grant has ended um
 
01:36:19.870 --> 01:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
so while you see it um in 24 and 25 it
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
does not carry forth because the grant
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
has ended
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
the Office of Consumer and family
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
Affairs that's 100% General funds and
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
out of that we fund um I'm just going to
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
make sure and I'm sure somebody behind
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
me will jump up if I'm incorrect but we
 
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
do um fund the staff that oversee our
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
agencies and then uh for Guardianship
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
Services that is um we have contracts
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
for Guardianship Services that um there
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
are with two um agencies and I think
 
01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about that when we talk about
 
01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:13.390 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about that when we talk about
prioritized

01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
needs same with commitment costs um
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
these are attorneys who represent
 
01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who have been subjected to
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
an involuntary emergency admission um
 
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
and so we have contracts with attorneys
 
01:37:31.870 --> 01:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
in that accounting
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
unit and then interim care funds are
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
very very small amount of funds that are
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
used in um unique circumstances where
 
01:37:45.550 --> 01:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
someone may need just one little bit of
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
um pot of money um to be able to
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
as we continue on slide 27 this is where
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
we start getting into the bulk and the
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
meat of the um of the contracts and the
 
01:38:09.310 --> 01:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
funding and the services so we have the
 
01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
community mental health program
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
support you'll see a lot of that is
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
General funds and when we talked about
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis that's where that is
 
01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:24.790 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis that's where that is
funded

01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
we have the next one which is peer
 
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
support services which are the peer
 
01:38:33.149 --> 01:38:33.159 align:start position:0%
support agencies that are across the
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
state we have contracts I believe with
 
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.709 align:start position:0%
state we have contracts I believe with
eight

01:38:37.709 --> 01:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
organizations and there um are 10
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
locations I believe throughout the state
 
01:38:47.229 --> 01:38:47.239 align:start position:0%
these are an a regional approach just
 
01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
like we have our community mental health
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
Family mutual supports is a contract
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
with nami New Hampshire and they provide
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh groups throughout the state and um
 
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
support families um as they address
 
01:39:11.709 --> 01:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
needs the mental health block grant is
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
the federally um funded block grant for
 
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
mental health from
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
SSA and this has funding that is goes
 
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
towards our um peer support agencies so
 
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
they have a mix of funds Our Community
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
Mental Health
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
Centers and um our crisis when we talked
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
about the set aside that's needed the 5%
 
01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
um that is for the access point um with
 
01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.589 --> 01:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned the next account um Mental
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
Health Data collect ction we um disperse
 
01:39:58.109 --> 01:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
those funds to our community mental
 
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
health centers and we have a contract
 
01:40:05.589 --> 01:40:05.599 align:start position:0%

budget we have essentially flatlined
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
that at the same amount and
 
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:11.480 align:start position:0%

for the mental health
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%

01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
increase and I know when you were when
 
01:41:39.589 --> 01:41:39.599 align:start position:0%

fiscally
 
01:41:53.870 --> 01:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
in having problems and I wondered um um
 
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
does this increase will this increase
 
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
help Shore them up and be sure that they
 
01:42:04.589 --> 01:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
work sure so I I I I would like to point
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
out that the um what you will see within
 
01:42:15.589 --> 01:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
the class 102 in accounting unit 4117 on
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
page 106 of the governor's operating
 
01:42:20.109 --> 01:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
budget the $5
 
01:42:22.589 --> 01:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
million um that the department had
 
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
requested in the prioritized need need
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
each year was indeed funded I can like K
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
you speak to that that specific
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
prioritized need yeah um and we did talk
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
about that and I believe that you've
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
heard from the Behavioral Health
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
Association about that as well about
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care um as we've increased
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
Services um and um have access um to
 
01:42:49.709 --> 01:42:49.719 align:start position:0%
these Services the Community Mental
 
01:42:53.790 --> 01:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
Health Centers not only have they um
 
01:42:56.589 --> 01:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
experience with the Medicaid unwind
 
01:42:59.229 --> 01:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
which is I think you heard about from
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
director Litman um that people who um
 
01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
had qualified for Medicaid during the
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic stayed on Medicaid and then um
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
were no longer eligible for Medicaid or
 
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
for some other reason um were no longer
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
covered by Medicaid and so the Community
 
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers continued to
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
provide those services to those
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
individuals and so they had no
 
01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:28.679 align:start position:0%
compensation um for that um as much as
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
self-pay um as they could get they would
 
01:43:34.350 --> 01:43:34.360 align:start position:0%
get um the other thing is there are
 
01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
services that are paid for by Medicaid
 
01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
that are not paid for um by commercial
 
01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
insurers so somebody who is commercially
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
insured may not have the ability to get
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
something covered um because it's just
 
01:43:51.070 --> 01:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
not a covered service so functional
 
01:43:53.589 --> 01:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
Support Services is one of those
 
01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
services so the Community Mental Health
 
01:43:59.589 --> 01:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
Centers um continue to provide services
 
01:44:02.189 --> 01:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
that they're not compensated for and we
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
have seen a growth in that and um an
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
increase in their operating losses and
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
we had asked for a continuation of a
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
one-time infusion of funds um in the uh
 
01:44:20.669 --> 01:44:20.679 align:start position:0%
La in this current biennium and so we
 
01:44:24.030 --> 01:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
had asked to continue that uh $5 million
 
01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
in each fiscal year and it was funded um
 
01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
and recognized by the governor as a need
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
to um continue um the Community Mental
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
Health Center's work um I'll leave it at
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
that I think there representative tersi
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
followed by representative
 
01:44:45.629 --> 01:44:45.639 align:start position:0%
Stringham representative tersi yields
 
01:44:45.639 --> 01:44:46.950 align:start position:0%
Stringham representative tersi yields
representative

01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:49.870 --> 01:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
Stringham yeah so you know we notic that
 
01:44:54.669 --> 01:44:54.679 align:start position:0%
um the um you know page 10 7 that uh the
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
budget was 24 million or actual
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
expenditures was is the reason why
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's somewhat lower is because there's
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
um non-aps funds from the previous bium
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
or have we really are we really talking
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
about a doubling of this um uh area sure
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
and and I I I think this is one of the
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
challenges with with the when you're
 
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the governor's operating
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
budget because you're not looking at
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
what was budgeted um it's a great
 
01:45:24.430 --> 01:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
question so what was budgeted in the
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
current uh State fiscal year was about
 
01:45:27.719 --> 01:45:29.390 align:start position:0%
current uh State fiscal year was about
$41.5

01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
$41.5
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
million um that particular class line
 
01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
does have a class note that allows for
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
the appropriation to carry forward what
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
we experienced in uh in the initial year
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
was uh some some billing delays so those
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
expenses will still occur but they'll be
 
01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
they'll occur in state fiscal year 25
 
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
for some of the 24 uh Services is what
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating right now so the um o
 
01:45:57.550 --> 01:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
overall the largest increase that that
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
you're seeing there is that that
 
01:46:00.990 --> 01:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
additional $5
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
million um that was added it is 100%
 
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
General funds um and there is no
 
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
available Federal match for
 
01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
that yeah so this this area overall
 
01:46:15.070 --> 01:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
we're looking at you know
 
01:46:19.589 --> 01:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
99% uh General funds so yes that is
 
01:46:21.070 --> 01:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
correct there there's only a small
 
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
amount of Medicaid admin that we're able
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
to claim in this area but is primarily
 
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
you all right let me get back on track
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
here so I think we're on page
 
01:46:41.229 --> 01:46:41.239 align:start position:0%
28 which is really just an overview of
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
the service system so again going from
 
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
all the way from Community Education and
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
awareness up to inpatient services with
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
a lot in between um so um we have the
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
strongest Granite campaign that's the
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
one I referenced earlier um that was a
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
universal approach to all populations
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
letting them know that help is available
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
and there is strength in help seeking um
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
and that campaign was pretty successful
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
I have the stats on that but I don't
 
01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:15.639 align:start position:0%
think I have them with me about you know
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
the Impressions the advertising the
 
01:47:21.790 --> 01:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
responses you know visits to sites uh to
 
01:47:24.589 --> 01:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
the site and things like that but um
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
very very um successful
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
campaign we have uh first episode
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
psychosis which is um a way to be able
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
to identify after that first episode and
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
get early intervention services to um a
 
01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:43.719 align:start position:0%
person and their
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
family peer support we've talked about
 
01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
we okay there are 12 locations I said 10
 
01:47:52.030 --> 01:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
earlier corrected by myself um so it's
 
01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:53.950 align:start position:0%
earlier corrected by myself um so it's
12

01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
12
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
and we have peer respit programs so when
 
01:47:58.990 --> 01:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
we look at the housing Continuum and the
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
needs um of individuals they have small
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
programs for beds a piece um and they
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
are able to stay have short stays
 
01:48:12.189 --> 01:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
they're usually about a week to couple
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
weeks um and it's for peers for peers
 
01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
and so um this is added to our ability
 
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
to address the needs of individual who
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
need just that break um as they take um
 
01:48:31.229 --> 01:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
from their community and take their next
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
steps Community Based Services and
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
supports again the um bedrock and um the
 
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
foundation are our community mental
 
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
health centers they provide a full array
 
01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.350 align:start position:0%
health centers they provide a full array
of

01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:48:47.950 --> 01:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
services um including those that are
 
01:48:53.229 --> 01:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
listed here we have um two centers as
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
we talked about there are Federal grant
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities and there was the
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
certified community behavioral health
 
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
clinics um and so we've worked very
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
closely with three Mental Health Centers
 
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
two of which have since become these
 
01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
clinics they're
 
01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:12.390 align:start position:0%
clinics they're
essentially

01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
um enhanced community base uh Community
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers so they have their
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers plus and
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
that plus is um the integrated approach
 
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
with substance use services and the um
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
close connection with physical Medical
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
Services I see questions so at least on
 
01:49:39.149 --> 01:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
the tip of the people's tongues
 
01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps bu I think we're all set okay
 
01:49:44.910 --> 01:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
great so um two have been certified they
 
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
um started um with their new payment
 
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
methodology and being the full-blown
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
ccbhcs and that's um in Manchester and
 
01:49:57.990 --> 01:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
NASA and West Central in Lebanon will be
 
01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
July the uh next is residential
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
treatment and housing supports um we
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
have a slide in here that shows the
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
growth of um the um type of um housing
 
01:50:17.709 --> 01:50:17.719 align:start position:0%
supports that we have we have again the
 
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
crisis Services we talked about and then
 
01:50:22.310 --> 01:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
we have inpatient Services which you'll
 
01:50:26.430 --> 01:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
hear more about um when um you have New
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital appear before you in
 
01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
talking about the designated receiving
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
facility beds of which there are 65 in
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
locations other than New Hampshire
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
hospital um the most recent of which is
 
01:50:49.229 --> 01:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:53.229 --> 01:50:53.239 align:start position:0%
beds and I think we're on page 29 and we
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
start looking at some statistics
 
01:50:59.470 --> 01:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
again the reason why we picked these
 
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
numbers to go through June of 2024 is
 
01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
because we had two Community Mental
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
Health Centers that converted um to
 
01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
their emrs to new uh software and new
 
01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
programs so they were not able to they
 
01:51:16.069 --> 01:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to produce the numbers
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
and anyone who sits on fiscal committee
 
01:51:20.350 --> 01:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
and sees the monthly dashboard knows
 
01:51:22.270 --> 01:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
that there has been a drop and that's a
 
01:51:24.990 --> 01:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
result to those two centers unable to be
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
able to produce those um numbers they're
 
01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
on it they're um looking at April an
 
01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
April time frame to be able to start
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
populating from a financial standpoint
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
and the data um that's needed and and
 
01:51:40.350 --> 01:51:40.360 align:start position:0%
how we capture it representative priest
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:51:44.189 --> 01:51:44.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you Madame chairman uh
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
back to um there's always a delay
 
01:51:50.589 --> 01:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
process with me and I'm sorry about that
 
01:51:53.069 --> 01:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
but on page 28
 
01:51:55.629 --> 01:51:55.639 align:start position:0%
on the inpatient uh
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
Services what is the vacancy rate for
 
01:51:58.320 --> 01:51:59.709 align:start position:0%
Services what is the vacancy rate for
those

01:51:59.709 --> 01:51:59.719 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:52:02.109 --> 01:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
beds that is a great question and we're
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
going to get a little bit into um what
 
01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
the state has done so that there isn't a
 
01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
huge vacancy rate um I don't know the
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
actual percentage but I would say that
 
01:52:12.719 --> 01:52:14.709 align:start position:0%
actual percentage but I would say that
it's

01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
probably on most days less than 10% okay
 
01:52:26.189 --> 01:52:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
so on uh slide 29 again showing and it's
 
01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
breaking it down between adults and
 
01:52:34.109 --> 01:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
children and this really is looking at
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
eligible children so they're and adults
 
01:52:39.310 --> 01:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
and when we talk about eligibility it's
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
a criteria that's established in um law
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
and Rule which um talks about um severe
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
mental illness and what the criteria is
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
for that and so that's what makes one
 
01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
eligible so this doesn't address all um
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
individuals who are seeking um services
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
for mental health it just is for those
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:16.510 --> 01:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
eligible all right um so page 30 I think
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
we're doing well on time here so um we
 
01:53:24.669 --> 01:53:24.679 align:start position:0%
have more than 98% of adults served by
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
the committee Mental Health Centers get
 
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
their treatment in an outpatient
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
Community Based setting so again um
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's always our goal we don't want
 
01:53:36.669 --> 01:53:36.679 align:start position:0%
people to have to hit a real high level
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
of care um if it's needed we want it to
 
01:53:42.069 --> 01:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
be available for those acute circum and
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
unique circumstances but we find we know
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
that uh treatment in the community uh
 
01:53:52.589 --> 01:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
works and it it's available and um
 
01:53:55.069 --> 01:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
that's where the need is and where we're
 
01:54:03.390 --> 01:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:07.470 --> 01:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
need all right slide
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
31 so critical time intervention is a
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
program that was supported um by the
 
01:54:18.990 --> 01:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
legislature um and it looks and so you
 
01:54:21.310 --> 01:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
can see the timeline of when it started
 
01:54:23.069 --> 01:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
and where it is today
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
um this looks at again transitions this
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
is going back to what I said earlier
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
about how those transitions in care are
 
01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
so important and so it's why it's named
 
01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
critical time um that it's a a point in
 
01:54:41.669 --> 01:54:41.679 align:start position:0%
time when someone who's leaving an acute
 
01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
setting and going into the community
 
01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
gets the care coordination and the help
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
they need and this is not um a clinical
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
service it's really a a um a service
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
that looks at real basic needs and
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
helping an individual navigate those
 
01:55:02.750 --> 01:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
needs and finding housing and finding
 
01:55:07.390 --> 01:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
the food bank and um work and and
 
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
working with um individuals the reason
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
why you see those numbers go up and down
 
01:55:14.669 --> 01:55:14.679 align:start position:0%
so wildly first of all the numbers are
 
01:55:17.550 --> 01:55:17.560 align:start position:0%
pretty small
 
01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
um oh I'm sorry I was looking I was
 
01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
thinking of CTI CTI is an area where
 
01:55:25.470 --> 01:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
we've had some staffing challenges the
 
01:55:26.910 --> 01:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers have had
 
01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
Staffing challenges so if I were to
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
present the data here which is not here
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
um you would see some ups and downs as
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
um the Staffing CH has changed over time
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
um but this is really about their
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
readmissions and this is um a a big um
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
data point that we look at we look at 30
 
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
60 990 and 180 day readmission
 
01:55:58.510 --> 01:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
and um this is something that we um work
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
with our Managed Care organizations we
 
01:56:03.069 --> 01:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
look at for the critical time
 
01:56:06.030 --> 01:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
Intervention Program um and it's
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
something that we hold ourselves
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
accountable to because once someone is
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
discharged we want them to be able to
 
01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
stay in the community and how are we
 
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
doing and how are we helping them do
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
that representative priest for a
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chairman thank
 
01:56:26.069 --> 01:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
you Mrs fo Miss Fox for uh taking my
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
question um I'm
 
01:56:33.229 --> 01:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm very happy to see that you are
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
addressing the need for a recovery of
 
01:56:41.589 --> 01:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
your patients and making sure and to
 
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
reduce their
 
01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
re-emissions are you coordinating your
 
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
programs with
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
communities and private recovery houses
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
um that we are seeing now in all of our
 
01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
communities so um coordination of
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
services is so important and um when we
 
01:57:05.709 --> 01:57:05.719 align:start position:0%
say that it's not just to a community
 
01:57:08.229 --> 01:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
mental health center but it may be other
 
01:57:10.709 --> 01:57:10.719 align:start position:0%
um types of services in a community um
 
01:57:13.229 --> 01:57:13.239 align:start position:0%
when we talk about recovery housing I
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
think it it's tough because we you know
 
01:57:16.669 --> 01:57:16.679 align:start position:0%
immediately like oh no we're going to
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
talk about that with our Bureau of drug
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
and alcohol services and we're going to
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
talk about that but there is um
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing in the mental health
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
field as well and so um we do have a
 
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
process and we do have some oversight
 
01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
over uh recovery housing which we'll
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:38.159 --> 01:57:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
minute

01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
okay so this is the housing inventory um
 
01:57:49.229 --> 01:57:49.239 align:start position:0%
we're pretty proud of this because we
 
01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
have been able to add to the inventory
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
of Supportive Housing um despite the
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
housing uh Crunch and so we've been
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
doing that in um several different ways
 
01:58:04.069 --> 01:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
of how we've been able to do that um
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
which I can talk about but this just
 
01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
shows that growth in how many people
 
01:58:11.870 --> 01:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
were able to support um in housing units
 
01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
state Miss Fox we're approaching the
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
noon time hour and so I'm just curious
 
01:58:26.069 --> 01:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
as to your thoughts of a Breaking Point
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
um and your thoughts for it looks like
 
01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
we're about halfway through the
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
presentation so I'm anticipating
 
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
probably another at least two hours more
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
of presenting unless you think
 
01:58:41.069 --> 01:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
differently but your thoughts um so I
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
really want to talk a lot about Mission
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
zero because I know it's something that
 
01:58:47.470 --> 01:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
you've heard about and so I worry that
 
01:58:50.910 --> 01:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
if we start that now then um we it might
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
be 1:00 before we finish um so it could
 
01:58:56.350 --> 01:58:56.360 align:start position:0%
be a good breaking point but um we're
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
here for you and plan the day on it so
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
sounds good is everybody okay to break
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
now for one
 
01:59:06.830 --> 01:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
hour one hour okay we will reconvene we
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
will pause thank you both very much oh
 
01:59:11.149 --> 01:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham I was going to
 
01:59:13.069 --> 01:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
say if we can make it shorter that would
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
be helpful for me but I'm okay with an
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%

02:48:18.359 --> 02:48:19.510 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health we've gone the whole
morning

02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:48:22.190 --> 02:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
since 10:00 a.m. through a packet that
 
02:48:25.190 --> 02:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
can be found online and now we'll
 
02:48:27.990 --> 02:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
continue uh where we were I think on
 
02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:29.870 align:start position:0%
continue uh where we were I think on
page

02:48:29.870 --> 02:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:48:33.950 --> 02:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
33 and we'll go from there I do intend
 
02:48:36.070 --> 02:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
to ask members of the audience if
 
02:48:39.429 --> 02:48:39.439 align:start position:0%
they're interested in testifying after
 
02:48:41.710 --> 02:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
the presentation concludes whenever
 
02:48:46.110 --> 02:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
whatever time that may be okay ready to
 
02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
begin when you're ready great thank you
 
02:48:50.790 --> 02:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
and good
 
02:48:54.670 --> 02:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon so as we were talking about um
 
02:48:58.110 --> 02:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
we want to get a little bit into Mission
 
02:49:00.630 --> 02:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
zero which again I think is something
 
02:49:03.950 --> 02:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
that um people have heard about what is
 
02:49:10.030 --> 02:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
Mission zero our um goal to have no one
 
02:49:12.309 --> 02:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
waiting in an emergency department in
 
02:49:14.670 --> 02:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire for an
 
02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
inpatient uh bed for mental health
 
02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:19.590 align:start position:0%
inpatient uh bed for mental health
services

02:49:19.590 --> 02:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:21.990 align:start position:0%
services
and

02:49:21.990 --> 02:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:25.469 --> 02:49:25.479 align:start position:0%
so I tried to hydrate uh over lunch so
 
02:49:26.830 --> 02:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
we'll see if I can do a little better
 
02:49:30.910 --> 02:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
with my voice here um so for this
 
02:49:34.150 --> 02:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
particular graphic you'll see that as
 
02:49:38.150 --> 02:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
part of mission zero we had six key
 
02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
Investments that we identified as
 
02:49:45.309 --> 02:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
needing to help us achieve that mission
 
02:49:47.830 --> 02:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
and so the certified community
 
02:49:49.349 --> 02:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
behavioral health clinics which I
 
02:49:52.190 --> 02:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
already talked about a little bit ago
 
02:49:57.229 --> 02:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
the um crisis uh stabilization centers
 
02:49:59.870 --> 02:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
we talked about those as well care
 
02:50:02.110 --> 02:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
traffic control that is something that
 
02:50:04.030 --> 02:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
you'll hear about more from New
 
02:50:06.750 --> 02:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital um and that really
 
02:50:08.550 --> 02:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
goes to what we are talking about the
 
02:50:10.990 --> 02:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
utilization of designated receiving
 
02:50:16.510 --> 02:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
facility beds they are now able to know
 
02:50:20.110 --> 02:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
in real time what beds are occupied and
 
02:50:23.110 --> 02:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
what which are available um should
 
02:50:25.269 --> 02:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
someone present an emergency department
 
02:50:27.150 --> 02:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
in the state and be able to help
 
02:50:29.590 --> 02:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
coordinate that effort so that a person
 
02:50:33.389 --> 02:50:33.399 align:start position:0%
can get into that um service level of
 
02:50:36.870 --> 02:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
service um in real time um so that's
 
02:50:39.790 --> 02:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
been really beneficial and helped us
 
02:50:43.110 --> 02:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
with that utilization so that uh we are
 
02:50:46.349 --> 02:50:46.359 align:start position:0%
closer to full utilization and not
 
02:50:50.030 --> 02:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
having um beds go unus when somebody
 
02:50:53.429 --> 02:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
could um needs one we've had an
 
02:50:55.670 --> 02:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
expansion in the designated receiving
 
02:50:58.429 --> 02:50:58.439 align:start position:0%
facility beds I mentioned the Dartmouth
 
02:51:01.510 --> 02:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh beds that have opened up and as part
 
02:51:02.510 --> 02:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:51:05.910 --> 02:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
HCA um acquisition of Catholic Medical
 
02:51:08.030 --> 02:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
Center there are going to be 10
 
02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
additional beds that were part of that
 
02:51:13.510 --> 02:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
um requirement through the Attorney
 
02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
General's approval of that acquisition
 
02:51:19.349 --> 02:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
um and so those will be additional drf
 
02:51:21.269 --> 02:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
beds that will be coming
 
02:51:25.790 --> 02:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
online we've had expansions in the care
 
02:51:28.590 --> 02:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
in step down and less restrictive
 
02:51:31.790 --> 02:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
settings this is really addressing one
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
of the drivers which um as you can see
 
02:51:36.309 --> 02:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side we have the front
 
02:51:39.269 --> 02:51:39.279 align:start position:0%
door the demand we have the impatient
 
02:51:41.070 --> 02:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
Supply the number of beds that are
 
02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
available and then we have the back door
 
02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
where does someone go once they um no
 
02:51:49.550 --> 02:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
longer need that acute level uh service
 
02:51:52.790 --> 02:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
and so those um supported housing that
 
02:51:55.550 --> 02:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
we've already talked about um and shown
 
02:51:58.950 --> 02:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
the growth of the um availability of
 
02:52:02.110 --> 02:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
supported housing um this is what number
 
02:52:03.469 --> 02:52:03.479 align:start position:0%
five is
 
02:52:06.030 --> 02:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
addressing and then number six is a
 
02:52:09.229 --> 02:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
program that has been very successful it
 
02:52:13.750 --> 02:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
is landlord incentives and this allows
 
02:52:18.590 --> 02:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
someone to have um a place that's
 
02:52:21.590 --> 02:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
available it's coupled with a bridge
 
02:52:25.150 --> 02:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
subsidy which is another program within
 
02:52:30.830 --> 02:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
the uh Division and it takes the
 
02:52:35.190 --> 02:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
supplemental funding that we provide to
 
02:52:38.550 --> 02:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
um someone who is awaiting a federal
 
02:52:41.469 --> 02:52:41.479 align:start position:0%
voucher for what used to be known as
 
02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
Section 8 housing it's a housing um
 
02:52:48.950 --> 02:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
Choice voucher and now um we take that
 
02:52:51.950 --> 02:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
and we incent landlords to rent to
 
02:52:54.590 --> 02:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
individuals who are transitioning from
 
02:52:58.269 --> 02:52:58.279 align:start position:0%
an inpatient setting and we've had um
 
02:53:00.950 --> 02:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
those transitions happen so that when
 
02:53:04.190 --> 02:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
someone is ready to be discharged from a
 
02:53:07.309 --> 02:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
drf they're able to discharge and then
 
02:53:10.070 --> 02:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
that opens up that bed for someone who's
 
02:53:14.990 --> 02:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
in acute crisis um and so these six
 
02:53:17.229 --> 02:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
drivers have really made a huge
 
02:53:19.910 --> 02:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
difference and have allowed us to
 
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
achieve Mission zero on in points of
 
02:53:25.830 --> 02:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
time and we've been able to sustain a
 
02:53:30.190 --> 02:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
much lower weight list um and the time
 
02:53:32.269 --> 02:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
that it takes from someone who lands in
 
02:53:35.190 --> 02:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
an emergency department in an acute
 
02:53:39.590 --> 02:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
crisis to get to a designating receiving
 
02:53:41.469 --> 02:53:41.479 align:start position:0%
facility bed of which of course New
 
02:53:44.150 --> 02:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital has um the largest
 
02:53:47.150 --> 02:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
number um that time has been reduced
 
02:53:50.070 --> 02:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
significantly so so we're really really
 
02:53:53.349 --> 02:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
um pleased with the work Mission zero
 
02:53:55.670 --> 02:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
remains something that we're always
 
02:53:58.110 --> 02:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
striving toward so we can't say we're
 
02:54:01.309 --> 02:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
done um but we continue to see the
 
02:54:05.190 --> 02:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
results as um we have uh expanded and
 
02:54:08.150 --> 02:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
enhanced and really focused on these six
 
02:54:10.630 --> 02:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
areas representative tki for a question
 
02:54:12.910 --> 02:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
followed by representative Stringham
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you congratulations on uh the
 
02:54:18.870 --> 02:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
department in getting this kind of um
 
02:54:22.389 --> 02:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
progress um and hitting um that zero
 
02:54:25.269 --> 02:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
weight which is excellent I am concerned
 
02:54:28.550 --> 02:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
though um with the potential changes to
 
02:54:30.830 --> 02:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid if we could talk about the
 
02:54:33.790 --> 02:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
number of people who are served that are
 
02:54:35.429 --> 02:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid and
 
02:54:39.790 --> 02:54:39.800 align:start position:0%
if there is a reduction in people who
 
02:54:42.870 --> 02:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
actually have coverage how that would
 
02:54:46.150 --> 02:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
affect Mission zero and your ability to
 
02:54:49.910 --> 02:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh move people through the system
 
02:54:52.870 --> 02:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
so I think um we're all concerned about
 
02:54:56.070 --> 02:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
changes in Medicaid um Medicaid
 
02:54:58.910 --> 02:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
underlies a lot of the services that are
 
02:55:02.349 --> 02:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
provided from a programmatic standpoint
 
02:55:06.030 --> 02:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
these are um significant uh Investments
 
02:55:08.150 --> 02:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
that have been made and while we could
 
02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
take any one of them and look at General
 
02:55:13.150 --> 02:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
funds and then Medicaid funds it really
 
02:55:17.910 --> 02:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
is intertwined and um important because
 
02:55:20.630 --> 02:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
in order in in addition to these
 
02:55:23.110 --> 02:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
Services there are just the regular
 
02:55:25.670 --> 02:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
Services um the services by the
 
02:55:27.349 --> 02:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers the
 
02:55:31.150 --> 02:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
appointments the um ongoing uh assertive
 
02:55:34.269 --> 02:55:34.279 align:start position:0%
Community treatment program um all of
 
02:55:37.389 --> 02:55:37.399 align:start position:0%
those um could impact the population and
 
02:55:40.389 --> 02:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
so we're closely monitoring that um I
 
02:55:42.550 --> 02:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
believe that you heard from director
 
02:55:45.429 --> 02:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
Litman every day um we have new
 
02:55:48.349 --> 02:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
information or Chang information and we
 
02:55:51.309 --> 02:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
continue to monitor monitor that very
 
02:55:55.590 --> 02:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
closely um but we know that um anytime
 
02:55:58.910 --> 02:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
we have someone who no longer has access
 
02:56:00.830 --> 02:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
because of insurance coverage whatever
 
02:56:04.550 --> 02:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
that is it's a missed opportunity and
 
02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:05.710 align:start position:0%
that is it's a missed opportunity and
it's

02:56:05.710 --> 02:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:56:09.429 --> 02:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:12.429 --> 02:56:12.439 align:start position:0%
you uh a question about uh the MH
 
02:56:16.429 --> 02:56:16.439 align:start position:0%
supported housing inventory um uh can
 
02:56:19.070 --> 02:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
you can you explain um
 
02:56:20.790 --> 02:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh what support there is first in
 
02:56:22.950 --> 02:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
constructing and making the inventory
 
02:56:25.309 --> 02:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
available and then what the ongoing
 
02:56:28.990 --> 02:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
costs are um uh to the state and to the
 
02:56:32.150 --> 02:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
department to uh continue to have it be
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
used sure there are um different um
 
02:56:40.510 --> 02:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
Financial um opportunities for the
 
02:56:44.469 --> 02:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
development of the housing we have um
 
02:56:47.870 --> 02:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
had um one-time funds the arpa funds
 
02:56:49.870 --> 02:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned that we use very
 
02:56:51.950 --> 02:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
strategically to build up our system
 
02:56:56.670 --> 02:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
that were used for renovations for um
 
02:56:59.830 --> 02:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
properties and um that either by our
 
02:57:02.990 --> 02:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers or we
 
02:57:06.510 --> 02:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
also have partnered with NFI North which
 
02:57:10.150 --> 02:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
um has a number of uh settings across
 
02:57:12.750 --> 02:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
the state for what's known as
 
02:57:16.710 --> 02:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
transitional housing and there also is
 
02:57:19.550 --> 02:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire housing fin Authority
 
02:57:23.510 --> 02:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
has the affordable housing fund that
 
02:57:28.070 --> 02:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
looks at projects um such as those that
 
02:57:31.030 --> 02:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
um provide for Supportive Housing um
 
02:57:34.269 --> 02:57:34.279 align:start position:0%
across uh different populations so as
 
02:57:36.150 --> 02:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
you may know they have certain
 
02:57:38.429 --> 02:57:38.439 align:start position:0%
populations so aging population is one
 
02:57:41.950 --> 02:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
that they um have as a priority as well
 
02:57:45.389 --> 02:57:45.399 align:start position:0%
as individuals with uh behavioral health
 
02:57:47.110 --> 02:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
conditions including mental health and
 
02:57:50.910 --> 02:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
sud so that's for the actual Capital
 
02:57:54.870 --> 02:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
costs and then the ongoing costs are
 
02:57:59.389 --> 02:57:59.399 align:start position:0%
depending on the way that the program is
 
02:58:02.269 --> 02:58:02.279 align:start position:0%
structured uh would depend so it could
 
02:58:04.190 --> 02:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
be that it's Medicaid
 
02:58:09.150 --> 02:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursable um or that it is um
 
02:58:11.870 --> 02:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
something that's supported 100% General
 
02:58:16.710 --> 02:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
funds um and there are the some of the
 
02:58:19.510 --> 02:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
supporting suppor housing has
 
02:58:22.110 --> 02:58:22.120 align:start position:0%
contributions by the
 
02:58:24.349 --> 02:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
individuals so when I mentioned housing
 
02:58:27.469 --> 02:58:27.479 align:start position:0%
Bridge subsidy it really is a subsidy it
 
02:58:31.469 --> 02:58:31.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't fully um pay for rent but it
 
02:58:33.710 --> 02:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
does it on a sliding fee
 
02:58:36.229 --> 02:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
scale representative priest followed by
 
02:58:39.190 --> 02:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative Neno thank you madam
 
02:58:42.510 --> 02:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and and thank you uh Miss Fox
 
02:58:45.269 --> 02:58:45.279 align:start position:0%
for taking my question again as I look
 
02:58:48.910 --> 02:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
at um the Bureau of Mental Health
 
02:58:51.510 --> 02:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
Services which this and many other
 
02:58:54.229 --> 02:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
programs fall under it looks like it's
 
02:58:57.309 --> 02:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
all federal funded is that
 
02:59:03.349 --> 02:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:03.359 --> 02:59:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
109

02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:15.429 --> 02:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
009 maybe some more to it sure that that
 
02:59:17.790 --> 02:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
specific accounting unit that that's the
 
02:59:20.590 --> 02:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
the mental health block grant and that's
 
02:59:22.830 --> 02:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
100% federal funds in that specific
 
02:59:25.550 --> 02:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
accounting unit yeah I I see on page 110
 
02:59:28.830 --> 02:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
that you have General funds to it at 56
 
02:59:30.510 --> 02:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you for that
 
02:59:32.990 --> 02:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you and and I think
 
02:59:35.590 --> 02:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
another important thing um we are
 
02:59:37.990 --> 02:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
talking about Mission zero here within
 
02:59:40.630 --> 02:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
the division for Behavioral Health but
 
02:59:42.590 --> 02:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
um there's elements of this that are
 
02:59:45.190 --> 02:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
also uh involved with New Hampshire
 
02:59:47.830 --> 02:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
hospital as well their staff play a role
 
02:59:49.349 --> 02:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
in in the care traffic control
 
02:59:51.510 --> 02:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
coordination and I know when Ellen Le
 
02:59:53.309 --> 02:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
Point the CEO of New Hampshire hospital
 
02:59:55.389 --> 02:59:55.399 align:start position:0%
will be here she'll be talking about
 
02:59:57.870 --> 02:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
that as well and so this isn't just this
 
03:00:00.870 --> 03:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
isn't just an initiative isolated to to
 
03:00:02.510 --> 03:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
the division for Behavioral Health
 
03:00:04.110 --> 03:00:04.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other actors and
 
03:00:07.950 --> 03:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
players and and their and other dollars
 
03:00:09.389 --> 03:00:09.399 align:start position:0%
involved in other areas of the
 
03:00:11.229 --> 03:00:11.239 align:start position:0%
department just because it's been such a
 
03:00:14.510 --> 03:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
a wide wide- ranging strategic effort so
 
03:00:17.469 --> 03:00:17.479 align:start position:0%
any funding effect on this from the
 
03:00:19.349 --> 03:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
federal government government or from
 
03:00:22.550 --> 03:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
the general fund would have uh
 
03:00:22.560 --> 03:00:24.110 align:start position:0%
the general fund would have uh
consequences

03:00:24.110 --> 03:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:30.150 --> 03:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
department there there could be
 
03:00:32.070 --> 03:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
consequences yes if if there's a
 
03:00:34.070 --> 03:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
reduction in funding towards this okay
 
03:00:37.750 --> 03:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
larger initiative yes thank
 
03:00:40.870 --> 03:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh Madam chair um I have
 
03:00:42.590 --> 03:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
kind of a high level question here this
 
03:00:46.150 --> 03:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
is a uh on page 33 is a 10year
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
representation of a 10year
 
03:00:50.429 --> 03:00:50.439 align:start position:0%
plan and if I were looking at this from
 
03:00:54.030 --> 03:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
a a budgeting and planning standpoint so
 
03:00:56.710 --> 03:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
my first question would be you know
 
03:00:59.389 --> 03:00:59.399 align:start position:0%
where we stand right now point in time
 
03:01:01.910 --> 03:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
and if I were to look at this as a pie
 
03:01:05.389 --> 03:01:05.399 align:start position:0%
chart what portion of resources is
 
03:01:08.710 --> 03:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
allocated to each one of these uh six
 
03:01:11.349 --> 03:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
different areas and then what's the
 
03:01:15.750 --> 03:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
expectation over time as to how that how
 
03:01:18.790 --> 03:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
that model would shift res resources I
 
03:01:21.269 --> 03:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
mean I know that's a you know it's a a
 
03:01:23.229 --> 03:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
30,000 foot level and maybe haven't
 
03:01:25.830 --> 03:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
looked at it that way but
 
03:01:28.110 --> 03:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
um I think at some point you would
 
03:01:29.790 --> 03:01:29.800 align:start position:0%
expect if you're successful in some of
 
03:01:32.510 --> 03:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
these areas you would see a you from a
 
03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
planning standpoint in a budgetary
 
03:01:37.910 --> 03:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint a shift in um in the resource
 
03:01:40.110 --> 03:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
allocation great question and I'm glad
 
03:01:42.070 --> 03:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
you brought up the 10-year plan which I
 
03:01:44.910 --> 03:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
should have um uh in my initial comments
 
03:01:47.990 --> 03:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
talked about that so the 10-year plan is
 
03:01:50.510 --> 03:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
is was established in
 
03:01:55.070 --> 03:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
2019 and it had front-loaded a lot of um
 
03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:56.389 align:start position:0%
2019 and it had front-loaded a lot of um
the

03:01:56.389 --> 03:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:01:59.910 --> 03:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations some of which are um a
 
03:02:01.750 --> 03:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see the results of those
 
03:02:04.349 --> 03:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations are in the programs have
 
03:02:06.910 --> 03:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
been uh stood up and exist today
 
03:02:09.990 --> 03:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
including mobile crisis and expanded
 
03:02:12.469 --> 03:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
housing opportunities we had some
 
03:02:14.710 --> 03:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
significant Medicaid rate increases that
 
03:02:18.550 --> 03:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
were part of that plan um if you
 
03:02:22.630 --> 03:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
Mission zero is you know a subpart of
 
03:02:24.990 --> 03:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
that plan which is much more wide
 
03:02:28.670 --> 03:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
ranging um and not specifically just to
 
03:02:31.590 --> 03:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
address um emergency room boarding which
 
03:02:36.070 --> 03:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
this is when we look um we are um we
 
03:02:38.950 --> 03:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
could identify how many how much funds
 
03:02:41.950 --> 03:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
go to each of these um what's important
 
03:02:44.429 --> 03:02:44.439 align:start position:0%
to know is that if you take any one of
 
03:02:47.630 --> 03:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
these away we would expect that we may
 
03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
um Backtrack on that mission zero so
 
03:02:52.750 --> 03:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
these need these are ongoing services
 
03:02:55.710 --> 03:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
that we believe need to be supported um
 
03:02:58.349 --> 03:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
we do know that the more that we're able
 
03:03:01.309 --> 03:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
to build up the these Services the less
 
03:03:04.990 --> 03:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
Reliance we're going to have on the um
 
03:03:07.269 --> 03:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
higher level of care in a designated
 
03:03:10.590 --> 03:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
receiving facility such as uh New
 
03:03:12.349 --> 03:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital so we're trying to
 
03:03:16.150 --> 03:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
decrease demand for that um while
 
03:03:19.469 --> 03:03:19.479 align:start position:0%
increasing those community reports and
 
03:03:23.550 --> 03:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
um this has been successful and um I
 
03:03:25.990 --> 03:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank uh representative cherski for
 
03:03:27.990 --> 03:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
congratulating the department but really
 
03:03:30.750 --> 03:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
it's congratulating all of the community
 
03:03:32.870 --> 03:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
providers um who've stood up these
 
03:03:35.309 --> 03:03:35.319 align:start position:0%
services and have every day worked with
 
03:03:38.510 --> 03:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
us um to address this need so I'm not
 
03:03:41.469 --> 03:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
sure if I answered your question but be
 
03:03:45.550 --> 03:03:45.560 align:start position:0%
happy to um clarify not directly but I
 
03:03:58.269 --> 03:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:00.670 --> 03:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
okay you can say
 
03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
it we're just
 
03:04:06.110 --> 03:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
um trying to make sure that we address
 
03:04:08.670 --> 03:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
that as far as um you know if you look
 
03:04:10.510 --> 03:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
at this as a pie chart would we move
 
03:04:12.590 --> 03:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
things around I think so I think we
 
03:04:15.110 --> 03:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to continue to expand drf
 
03:04:16.750 --> 03:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
beds that we could move some of those
 
03:04:19.469 --> 03:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
resources into the housing supports for
 
03:04:22.190 --> 03:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
example um that would be one that we
 
03:04:25.710 --> 03:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
could see um
 
03:04:28.630 --> 03:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
so yeah what I was looking at is really
 
03:04:30.750 --> 03:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
if if you're successful you know just
 
03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
looking at this over the time span that
 
03:04:37.150 --> 03:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the metrics H for
 
03:04:40.190 --> 03:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
Success on this would suggest that you
 
03:04:42.630 --> 03:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
you'd see a shift in you'd see savings
 
03:04:44.950 --> 03:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
you'd see budgetary implications in each
 
03:04:47.990 --> 03:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
one of these uh areas and you'd see
 
03:04:50.269 --> 03:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
decided if you were successful in what
 
03:04:52.990 --> 03:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
your goals and objectives are but that's
 
03:04:55.590 --> 03:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know I said prepared to leave that
 
03:04:58.910 --> 03:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
for now I I I think when when thinking
 
03:05:02.110 --> 03:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
about savings um one important thing is
 
03:05:03.870 --> 03:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
to sort of
 
03:05:05.910 --> 03:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
understand you know where the 10year
 
03:05:08.190 --> 03:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
mental health plan came from as far as
 
03:05:10.630 --> 03:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
litigation other active litigation
 
03:05:12.630 --> 03:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
against the state where we are not
 
03:05:14.750 --> 03:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
satisfying the all of the needs out
 
03:05:17.229 --> 03:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
there so when just thinking of it you
 
03:05:19.790 --> 03:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
know in simple operating terms well you
 
03:05:21.990 --> 03:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
may assume that there's some savings
 
03:05:24.469 --> 03:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
there's also some other factors behind
 
03:05:27.950 --> 03:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
the scenes that um that that exists
 
03:05:30.349 --> 03:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
basically so it's not necessarily if you
 
03:05:33.269 --> 03:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
invest now then you can save later um
 
03:05:35.510 --> 03:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's part of it's looking at what was
 
03:05:37.710 --> 03:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
occurring prior to doing these things
 
03:05:41.269 --> 03:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
such as individuals waiting uh for care
 
03:05:44.190 --> 03:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
and E boarding and where we've been able
 
03:05:45.950 --> 03:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
to get that number down
 
03:05:48.150 --> 03:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
significantly um that's not an area
 
03:05:49.750 --> 03:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
where you can necessarily go back
 
03:05:50.950 --> 03:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
because if you go back you're probably
 
03:05:52.110 --> 03:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
going to end up in the same spot you
 
03:05:52.120 --> 03:05:55.870 align:start position:0%
going to end up in the same spot you
were

03:05:55.870 --> 03:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:58.750 --> 03:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
in thank you representative
 
03:06:01.429 --> 03:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Madame chairman um
 
03:06:03.550 --> 03:06:03.560 align:start position:0%
again on page uh
 
03:06:08.670 --> 03:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
33 um do you have um you you mentioned
 
03:06:11.309 --> 03:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
the success and
 
03:06:14.670 --> 03:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
again as with my uh fellow
 
03:06:17.590 --> 03:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative I do congratulate you uh
 
03:06:19.389 --> 03:06:19.399 align:start position:0%
on these key Investments and what you
 
03:06:22.190 --> 03:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
are doing do you have any numbers that
 
03:06:26.030 --> 03:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:29.510 --> 03:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
um yes show this and I would like to see
 
03:06:33.389 --> 03:06:33.399 align:start position:0%
them and how far back do they go yeah so
 
03:06:36.670 --> 03:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
um as Nathan mentioned you're going to
 
03:06:38.990 --> 03:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
be hearing from New Hampshire hospital
 
03:06:41.870 --> 03:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
we actually H uh publish a dashboard
 
03:06:46.229 --> 03:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
that is live um and public facing that
 
03:06:47.990 --> 03:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
we can get you the link to to where
 
03:06:51.590 --> 03:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
you're able to see that data so we um
 
03:06:57.030 --> 03:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
look at um the completion of a um
 
03:06:59.510 --> 03:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
submission of a
 
03:07:02.030 --> 03:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
involuntary emergency admission
 
03:07:05.710 --> 03:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
paperwork and one um how long it takes
 
03:07:10.030 --> 03:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
from that uh completed iea uh form to be
 
03:07:13.510 --> 03:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
submitted to our care traffic control to
 
03:07:16.990 --> 03:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
how long it takes to locate a drf that
 
03:07:20.389 --> 03:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
can accept accept that uh person and so
 
03:07:22.349 --> 03:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
we have all of those metrics you can see
 
03:07:26.830 --> 03:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
the whole thing on the wait times the um
 
03:07:29.550 --> 03:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
weight list and how that has changed
 
03:07:31.429 --> 03:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
over time so we'll be happy to share
 
03:07:41.910 --> 03:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:44.309 --> 03:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
Youk it's interesting because I've been
 
03:07:46.469 --> 03:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
watching your sessions and so I pick up
 
03:07:48.150 --> 03:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
on things that you're asking that are
 
03:07:50.590 --> 03:07:50.600 align:start position:0%
going to be for me and now I'm doing
 
03:07:53.030 --> 03:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
exactly the same thing oh wait until you
 
03:07:55.190 --> 03:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
hear from this part of the department
 
03:07:57.870 --> 03:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
not me but from them so it's interesting
 
03:08:00.870 --> 03:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
how the can gets kicked um but we want
 
03:08:02.670 --> 03:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
to make sure that as a department we're
 
03:08:05.190 --> 03:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
answering all of your questions so um
 
03:08:08.030 --> 03:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
bear with us as um we go through this
 
03:08:11.229 --> 03:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
because um you will get your your
 
03:08:13.590 --> 03:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
questions answered it just might not be
 
03:08:18.550 --> 03:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:21.110 --> 03:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
all right um slide 34 I'm going to
 
03:08:22.830 --> 03:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
actually skip some of this because we
 
03:08:25.910 --> 03:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
already talked about it um but it's the
 
03:08:29.030 --> 03:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
um more detail about the
 
03:08:32.830 --> 03:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
ccbhc clinics and what they are and um
 
03:08:36.550 --> 03:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
how they um are different from cmhc's
 
03:08:40.429 --> 03:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
but um are in how they are being stood
 
03:08:43.590 --> 03:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
up one thing of note you're going to be
 
03:08:46.830 --> 03:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
talking about hb2 I assume at some point
 
03:08:50.910 --> 03:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
in time at the end of um hb1 going
 
03:08:52.190 --> 03:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
through all these
 
03:08:56.790 --> 03:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
presentations and um we have the
 
03:08:59.469 --> 03:08:59.479 align:start position:0%
language um that I know that you talked
 
03:09:01.790 --> 03:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
about I believe Nathan so that I could
 
03:09:04.070 --> 03:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
explain it um where it talks about
 
03:09:06.190 --> 03:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
weightless and it talks about
 
03:09:09.790 --> 03:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
suspending um the um a particular state
 
03:09:12.670 --> 03:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
law and that has been the prospective
 
03:09:16.190 --> 03:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
appeal of the suspension of that law um
 
03:09:18.389 --> 03:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
it gets very confusing but what it that
 
03:09:21.670 --> 03:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
does what the current footnote does is
 
03:09:24.670 --> 03:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
it allows the Community Mental Health
 
03:09:27.269 --> 03:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
Centers to develop a weight list based
 
03:09:29.950 --> 03:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
on funding um
 
03:09:32.990 --> 03:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
availability because otherwise state law
 
03:09:35.870 --> 03:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
indicates that they have to accept
 
03:09:38.510 --> 03:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
anybody who is seeking Services
 
03:09:42.830 --> 03:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
regardless of their ability to pay CC um
 
03:09:44.910 --> 03:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
so that has been suspended so they have
 
03:09:47.590 --> 03:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
been able to maintain that weight list
 
03:09:52.630 --> 03:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
um and um help um stem some of their
 
03:09:57.229 --> 03:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
operating losses with the ccbhc model um
 
03:10:01.710 --> 03:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
in order to qualify for the federal
 
03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
demonstration they do not have that
 
03:10:07.070 --> 03:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
luxury so they are um we're closely
 
03:10:09.190 --> 03:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
monitoring knowing this just went live
 
03:10:12.830 --> 03:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
on on January 1st if they're seeing an
 
03:10:17.710 --> 03:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
even more increased uh demand um that is
 
03:10:19.429 --> 03:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
compensated so we're going to be
 
03:10:23.030 --> 03:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
following that and and for for General
 
03:10:26.150 --> 03:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
context and orientation it's on page uh
 
03:10:30.389 --> 03:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
48 of the draft hb2 that you have and
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's entitled this section doesn't have
 
03:10:34.150 --> 03:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
a number but it's entitled prospective
 
03:10:36.550 --> 03:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
repeal regarding eligibility for
 
03:10:40.469 --> 03:10:40.479 align:start position:0%
services extended and it's followed by
 
03:10:44.950 --> 03:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
amend 2011 2096 uh and so forth but but
 
03:10:46.870 --> 03:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
effectively what you're seeing in house
 
03:10:50.269 --> 03:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
buil is as KATU was saying the effective
 
03:10:54.229 --> 03:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
date of the original HB 191 from 2011 is
 
03:10:58.349 --> 03:10:58.359 align:start position:0%
being extended out to July 1st of
 
03:11:00.950 --> 03:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
2027 and the reason why I raise it here
 
03:11:03.910 --> 03:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
again is that the ccbhcs will not be
 
03:11:05.950 --> 03:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
able to take advantage of that because
 
03:11:07.590 --> 03:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
of the federal demonstration the
 
03:11:11.030 --> 03:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
requirement by CMS that they accept all
 
03:11:14.590 --> 03:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
um of those who um come to to their
 
03:11:15.710 --> 03:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
doors for
 
03:11:17.550 --> 03:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
services so that's where the
 
03:11:20.590 --> 03:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care discussion of that $5
 
03:11:29.590 --> 03:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:32.309 --> 03:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
play um so I'm GNA again I'm going to
 
03:11:34.269 --> 03:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
skip through this if you have questions
 
03:11:34.279 --> 03:11:35.110 align:start position:0%
skip through this if you have questions
about

03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:11:39.030 --> 03:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
ccbhc please let me know and stop me um
 
03:11:45.710 --> 03:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay so this is to improve
 
03:11:52.070 --> 03:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
access um for
 
03:11:55.429 --> 03:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
services and this is very specific to
 
03:11:58.030 --> 03:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
those um who are on Medicaid but you
 
03:12:02.469 --> 03:12:02.479 align:start position:0%
don't open up um a service based um like
 
03:12:04.429 --> 03:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
a a Community Mental Health Center
 
03:12:07.790 --> 03:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't say okay your Medicaid and your
 
03:12:11.429 --> 03:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
XYZ they're going to um evaluate the
 
03:12:14.990 --> 03:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
patient needs so that's what um this is
 
03:12:17.790 --> 03:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
looking at um while it's AIC a
 
03:12:20.190 --> 03:12:20.200 align:start position:0%
demonstration it does require us to
 
03:12:22.870 --> 03:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
serve um everybody who comes through the
 
03:12:26.790 --> 03:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
doors there's a certification process we
 
03:12:29.790 --> 03:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
received as um a department a Federal
 
03:12:31.469 --> 03:12:31.479 align:start position:0%
grant so that we could set up that
 
03:12:34.630 --> 03:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
certification process and that is what
 
03:12:39.710 --> 03:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester and nashaa um achieved um and
 
03:12:41.950 --> 03:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
that's what West Central behavioral
 
03:12:44.110 --> 03:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
health is going through right
 
03:12:48.190 --> 03:12:48.200 align:start position:0%
now and the idea is that people have
 
03:12:52.070 --> 03:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
access and there'll be um high quality
 
03:12:56.910 --> 03:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
services and it will focus on that care
 
03:13:00.550 --> 03:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
cordination and um that we should see as
 
03:13:03.030 --> 03:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
part of mission zero and as part of this
 
03:13:05.950 --> 03:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
demonstration a decreased demand for
 
03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:14.070 --> 03:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
Services um and slide 38 strong as
 
03:13:16.950 --> 03:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
Granite this is some of the media that
 
03:13:24.229 --> 03:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:26.950 --> 03:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
campaign Suicide Prevention we've talked
 
03:13:28.750 --> 03:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
about that we are going to get that
 
03:13:32.990 --> 03:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
report to you um and this is um part of
 
03:13:36.389 --> 03:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
that which is the 988 and ways to
 
03:13:43.510 --> 03:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:47.190 --> 03:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
effort and I will pause there and then
 
03:13:49.190 --> 03:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
go on do representative Daniels for a
 
03:13:50.750 --> 03:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you do you coordinate
 
03:13:54.990 --> 03:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
with the VA at all we do so the VA has a
 
03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:56.870 align:start position:0%
with the VA at all we do so the VA has a
special

03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
special
 
03:14:02.990 --> 03:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
um response and a team of uh call center
 
03:14:06.630 --> 03:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
staff who who are specifically um
 
03:14:10.670 --> 03:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
well-versed in veterans um matters and
 
03:14:13.590 --> 03:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
so yes we very much do and they are part
 
03:14:17.590 --> 03:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
of our uh 988 steering committee and our
 
03:14:21.030 --> 03:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
our subgroups so yes do your statistics
 
03:14:24.910 --> 03:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
on on uh Suicide Prevention include the
 
03:14:28.750 --> 03:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
VA yes yes so we can actually break out
 
03:14:33.469 --> 03:14:33.479 align:start position:0%
um from 98 988 how many um people whove
 
03:14:36.030 --> 03:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
accessed those Services um have gone
 
03:14:38.750 --> 03:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
through the the specialized veteran line
 
03:14:42.190 --> 03:14:42.200 align:start position:0%
so yes it it is a population that we pay
 
03:14:49.269 --> 03:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:49.279 --> 03:14:50.070 align:start position:0%
 
all

03:14:50.070 --> 03:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:14:52.510 --> 03:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
right so I think we have two more
 
03:14:54.590 --> 03:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
bureaus to go so
 
03:14:58.190 --> 03:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
halfway Bureau of homeless
 
03:15:00.389 --> 03:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
services so the Bureau of homeless
 
03:15:04.349 --> 03:15:04.359 align:start position:0%
Services joined us um about three years
 
03:15:07.670 --> 03:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
ago I believe um with a recognition that
 
03:15:13.510 --> 03:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
many of the um issues are um that
 
03:15:15.870 --> 03:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
homelessness is a factor with mental
 
03:15:18.750 --> 03:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
health and substance use conditions and
 
03:15:22.990 --> 03:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
vice versa um and so we wanted to uh
 
03:15:26.030 --> 03:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
fold in homeless Services into our
 
03:15:28.830 --> 03:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
division and to address those
 
03:15:32.030 --> 03:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
needs the uh accounting
 
03:15:36.670 --> 03:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
units so we're looking at the path Grant
 
03:15:39.550 --> 03:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
this is a grant and um we'll get a
 
03:15:42.389 --> 03:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
little bit more into this but this is we
 
03:15:44.670 --> 03:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
contract with four Community Mental
 
03:15:49.150 --> 03:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:51.590 --> 03:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
the next
 
03:15:55.309 --> 03:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
um accounting unit is the housing and
 
03:15:59.550 --> 03:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
shelter program this houses uh our
 
03:16:04.910 --> 03:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
contracts for um state grants in Aid
 
03:16:07.150 --> 03:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
which is all the homeless shelters that
 
03:16:11.710 --> 03:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
we fund across the state um and we'll um
 
03:16:14.030 --> 03:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
talk about that but under prioritized
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
needs This was um
 
03:16:22.389 --> 03:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
under uh Senate Bill 406 last session we
 
03:16:26.550 --> 03:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
received uh $2.5 million to increase the
 
03:16:29.870 --> 03:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
rates for shelters and we were able to
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
do that and in the governor's budget it
 
03:16:36.110 --> 03:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
is funded um to continue those rates at
 
03:16:38.710 --> 03:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
that level so that prioritized need was
 
03:16:41.269 --> 03:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
submitted and picked up and is in the
 
03:16:43.110 --> 03:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
budget that you're looking
 
03:16:47.349 --> 03:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
at also in this account our our um
 
03:16:51.590 --> 03:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
federal funds from housing and uh Urban
 
03:16:54.990 --> 03:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
Development and our emergency Solutions
 
03:16:57.070 --> 03:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
Grant again I'll go into these programs
 
03:17:00.790 --> 03:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
but those those are funded out of this
 
03:17:03.070 --> 03:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
account representative tarki for a
 
03:17:06.710 --> 03:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
question hi thank you um on page
 
03:17:13.030 --> 03:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
1012 um can we look at I think it's line
 
03:17:16.150 --> 03:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
102 and discuss the bill that this
 
03:17:18.150 --> 03:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
division has been looking at regarding
 
03:17:20.229 --> 03:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
the Waypoint Youth Shelter Services
 
03:17:22.870 --> 03:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
there's been some confusion of people
 
03:17:24.429 --> 03:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
saying it's included in the budget it's
 
03:17:27.070 --> 03:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
not included in the budget and if it is
 
03:17:30.189 --> 03:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
in the budget do we need to specify it's
 
03:17:32.229 --> 03:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:17:35.309 --> 03:17:35.319 align:start position:0%
Waypoint so it it's in the budget it is
 
03:17:38.349 --> 03:17:38.359 align:start position:0%
in that budget line it's in um 102 as
 
03:17:41.950 --> 03:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
are those um that prioritize needs for
 
03:17:44.070 --> 03:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
the shelter program so yes the half
 
03:17:47.189 --> 03:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
million per year is in this budget I
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
have another
 
03:17:51.349 --> 03:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
question if I remember correctly it was
 
03:17:53.429 --> 03:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
also in last year's budget but they
 
03:17:56.189 --> 03:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
didn't receive the funds which is why we
 
03:17:59.030 --> 03:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
had this bill
 
03:18:04.150 --> 03:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
filed they so um they did receive the
 
03:18:08.990 --> 03:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
funds um that were um part of I'm trying
 
03:18:10.670 --> 03:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
to think of where they came in but they
 
03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
were part of um an allocation that was
 
03:18:17.510 --> 03:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
made um they and this just continues
 
03:18:20.830 --> 03:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
that funding so the bill um at the same
 
03:18:22.990 --> 03:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
time we put it in as a prioritized need
 
03:18:25.309 --> 03:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
there was also the separate bill to fund
 
03:18:27.389 --> 03:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
them same dollar amounts which is why I
 
03:18:29.269 --> 03:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
think you've seen and heard some
 
03:18:31.990 --> 03:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
different things but right now the half
 
03:18:33.950 --> 03:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars that we had previously
 
03:18:36.950 --> 03:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
funded them at um that they're currently
 
03:18:40.229 --> 03:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
um under contract to receive uh is
 
03:18:42.830 --> 03:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
continued through this budget as it is
 
03:18:44.910 --> 03:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
today okay so you're saying we don't
 
03:18:48.429 --> 03:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
need to specify anything hb1 that
 
03:18:50.910 --> 03:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
determines the money goes to Waypoint
 
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
young adult
 
03:18:52.800 --> 03:18:54.790 align:start position:0%
young adult
shelter

03:18:54.790 --> 03:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
shelter
 
03:18:57.510 --> 03:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
um there'd be nothing prohibiting you
 
03:18:59.229 --> 03:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
from putting a class note in there
 
03:19:03.150 --> 03:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
saying of the $500,000 budget in each
 
03:19:06.309 --> 03:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
year the buy 500,000 she go to Waypoint
 
03:19:08.830 --> 03:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of providing you
 
03:19:10.990 --> 03:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
shelter I guess I'm just trying to get
 
03:19:12.670 --> 03:19:12.680 align:start position:0%
back to the original discussion from
 
03:19:14.429 --> 03:19:14.439 align:start position:0%
maybe two months ago when that bill was
 
03:19:17.229 --> 03:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
filed to oh I am so glad glad the door
 
03:19:17.239 --> 03:19:18.990 align:start position:0%
filed to oh I am so glad glad the door
just

03:19:18.990 --> 03:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:19:21.990 --> 03:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
opened representative walner we're
 
03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
discussing um shelter and
 
03:19:29.830 --> 03:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
Waypoint on page 41 of our PowerPoint
 
03:19:32.309 --> 03:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
not to put you on the spot um but to
 
03:19:35.630 --> 03:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
bring you up to speed um the wayo half a
 
03:19:38.790 --> 03:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
million dollar a year funding is
 
03:19:41.510 --> 03:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
included in hb1 which I think we're all
 
03:19:44.349 --> 03:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
thrilled to find out um we're just
 
03:19:46.389 --> 03:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
discussing if we feel that there needs
 
03:19:49.790 --> 03:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
to an amendment for a class note that
 
03:19:52.550 --> 03:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
specifies the allocation to Waypoint so
 
03:19:54.670 --> 03:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you would have any
 
03:20:01.790 --> 03:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:03.790 --> 03:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
that I think it's something we should
 
03:20:08.229 --> 03:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
discuss about um really noting in the
 
03:20:10.870 --> 03:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
budget that it is for Waypoint or I
 
03:20:10.880 --> 03:20:14.150 align:start position:0%
budget that it is for Waypoint or I
don't

03:20:14.150 --> 03:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:18.910 --> 03:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
know okay sure yeah and this was um this
 
03:20:21.750 --> 03:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
was a uh prioritized need of the
 
03:20:24.189 --> 03:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
department for this bium so there is
 
03:20:26.269 --> 03:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
that record but we've certainly had
 
03:20:29.349 --> 03:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
instances in the current bium where
 
03:20:31.630 --> 03:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
something as as representative teris is
 
03:20:34.349 --> 03:20:34.359 align:start position:0%
uh suggesting where it clearly specifies
 
03:20:36.189 --> 03:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
that that money is intended for this
 
03:20:39.070 --> 03:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
Purpose with this provider so okay great
 
03:20:41.070 --> 03:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Neno for
 
03:20:43.269 --> 03:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
question yeah I'm so I'm confused so
 
03:20:45.349 --> 03:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
that means we don't need the bill that
 
03:20:48.030 --> 03:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
was filed for that
 
03:20:50.870 --> 03:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's what we're sorry that's what
 
03:20:54.189 --> 03:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
we're trying to determine so if it's if
 
03:20:58.389 --> 03:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
it's included in the budget and if we uh
 
03:21:00.830 --> 03:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
somehow get a note in some kind of a
 
03:21:02.269 --> 03:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
note in there that says it's
 
03:21:03.790 --> 03:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
specifically in the budget for that
 
03:21:06.229 --> 03:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
purpose then that would make the the
 
03:21:08.830 --> 03:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
bill moot right so we'll probably
 
03:21:10.590 --> 03:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
discuss it at a future date when we're
 
03:21:12.870 --> 03:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
looking digging into doing amendments
 
03:21:15.710 --> 03:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
but it's my understanding it was the
 
03:21:17.510 --> 03:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
specifying that it's supposed this
 
03:21:19.110 --> 03:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
amount is supposed to go to this
 
03:21:21.750 --> 03:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
particular service was the question so
 
03:21:24.030 --> 03:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we'll talk about it down the
 
03:21:25.510 --> 03:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
road yeah we just want to make sure
 
03:21:28.150 --> 03:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
we're not not double it won't be double
 
03:21:31.710 --> 03:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
I assure you so it sounds like this note
 
03:21:34.070 --> 03:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's referred to uh would amend the
 
03:21:36.309 --> 03:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
bill would replace it essentially in
 
03:21:39.309 --> 03:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
order to make clear where the money is
 
03:21:42.110 --> 03:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
allocated in the budget or would it add
 
03:21:42.120 --> 03:21:43.070 align:start position:0%
allocated in the budget or would it add
to

03:21:43.070 --> 03:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:21:46.710 --> 03:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
it it would depend so if you itl the
 
03:21:48.990 --> 03:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
other Bill and you added a class note
 
03:21:52.510 --> 03:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
directly in the department to um use
 
03:21:54.670 --> 03:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
those funds in whatever specified amount
 
03:21:54.680 --> 03:21:55.590 align:start position:0%
those funds in whatever specified amount
the

03:21:55.590 --> 03:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:21:58.590 --> 03:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
500,000 um then the bill wouldn't be
 
03:22:02.870 --> 03:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
needed um but I'll I'll defer to the the
 
03:22:05.269 --> 03:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
committee on that okay representative
 
03:22:06.670 --> 03:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
Walder on this topic and then
 
03:22:09.349 --> 03:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative priest yes on this topic
 
03:22:12.830 --> 03:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
so I think the practice at the finance
 
03:22:15.429 --> 03:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
committee in the past on situations like
 
03:22:16.910 --> 03:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
this where there was a bill and then
 
03:22:19.790 --> 03:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
there was an appropriation in the budget
 
03:22:22.309 --> 03:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
usually we have retained the
 
03:22:24.469 --> 03:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
bill that means the bill doesn't go
 
03:22:26.510 --> 03:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
forth it just stays right here in the
 
03:22:30.469 --> 03:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
finance committee and then the budget we
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
roll the amount into the budget we
 
03:22:37.429 --> 03:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
retain the bill once the budget is
 
03:22:40.469 --> 03:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
completed in June we would still have
 
03:22:43.110 --> 03:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
the bill as retained but we would report
 
03:22:47.110 --> 03:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
it out next year as inexpedient to
 
03:22:49.429 --> 03:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
legislate so that we haven't given up
 
03:22:52.229 --> 03:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
the bill to only to find out I mean if
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
the if
 
03:22:56.429 --> 03:22:56.439 align:start position:0%
the finance committee leaves it in the
 
03:22:58.469 --> 03:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
budget and we send it over to the Senate
 
03:23:00.670 --> 03:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
and they take it
 
03:23:05.309 --> 03:23:05.319 align:start position:0%
out then we might lose it as long as we
 
03:23:07.150 --> 03:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
as long as we're still in possession of
 
03:23:09.189 --> 03:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
the bill we might be able to do
 
03:23:12.150 --> 03:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
something with it in the next
 
03:23:15.070 --> 03:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
year okay thanks for the clarification
 
03:23:18.110 --> 03:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
for a newcomer to the whole process here
 
03:23:20.070 --> 03:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative priest for
 
03:23:22.910 --> 03:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
question I want to thank representative
 
03:23:25.510 --> 03:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
wallers for coming in and explaining
 
03:23:28.550 --> 03:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
that that was my question about that
 
03:23:31.710 --> 03:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
retention would be the best option uh at
 
03:23:35.630 --> 03:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
this time and instead of it Ling it but
 
03:23:39.910 --> 03:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
I did have another question regarding um
 
03:23:39.920 --> 03:23:41.150 align:start position:0%
I did have another question regarding um
on

03:23:41.150 --> 03:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:23:41.160 --> 03:23:42.950 align:start position:0%
on
page

03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:23:47.750 --> 03:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
1013 no I'm sorry um on on 1011 when it
 
03:23:50.670 --> 03:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
talks about the funding for this
 
03:23:54.590 --> 03:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
division it shows that um you are
 
03:23:57.389 --> 03:23:57.399 align:start position:0%
getting uh $5
 
03:24:00.710 --> 03:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
million um from a federal source and
 
03:24:02.630 --> 03:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
then you're going to be transferring
 
03:24:04.389 --> 03:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
that $5
 
03:24:07.590 --> 03:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
million um I'm sorry it's on page
 
03:24:10.750 --> 03:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
1012 estimate a source of
 
03:24:13.870 --> 03:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
funding transfer from other agencies and
 
03:24:15.670 --> 03:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
then you'll be taking it away can you
 
03:24:18.389 --> 03:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
explain that for for me
 
03:24:22.429 --> 03:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
please sure so the transfer from other
 
03:24:25.990 --> 03:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
agency line what that represents is that
 
03:24:29.269 --> 03:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
represents a $5 million transfer from
 
03:24:34.030 --> 03:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement trust fund okay and
 
03:24:37.670 --> 03:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
that is located there's a corresponding
 
03:24:41.710 --> 03:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
provision on page 47 of the draft hb2
 
03:24:45.910 --> 03:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
document that you have that provides for
 
03:24:45.920 --> 03:24:47.510 align:start position:0%
document that you have that provides for
that

03:24:47.510 --> 03:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:24:51.990 --> 03:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh for that transfer there okay and
 
03:24:56.469 --> 03:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
those dollars are being moved to support
 
03:25:00.630 --> 03:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
the um the SGI the the shelter
 
03:25:06.510 --> 03:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
contracts as um there is a there's a a a
 
03:25:08.950 --> 03:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
a a correlation between opioid use
 
03:25:12.469 --> 03:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
disorder or risk of opioid use disorder
 
03:25:15.670 --> 03:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
um for for members of of that population
 
03:25:16.870 --> 03:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
and that that's
 
03:25:18.150 --> 03:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
that that was added during the
 
03:25:20.710 --> 03:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
governor's phase and and the general
 
03:25:24.110 --> 03:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
fund uh portion of that was was reduced
 
03:25:26.349 --> 03:25:26.359 align:start position:0%
from the agency to the governor's phase
 
03:25:29.429 --> 03:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
there okay so then you have less funds
 
03:25:32.790 --> 03:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
for budgeted budgeted Revenue transfers
 
03:25:34.590 --> 03:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
and it's it looks like you've taken the
 
03:25:38.189 --> 03:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
$5 million out again and I'm confused
 
03:25:41.990 --> 03:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
about that can you clarify that so
 
03:25:45.510 --> 03:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
that that is put in and take it out sure
 
03:25:45.520 --> 03:25:47.070 align:start position:0%
that that is put in and take it out sure
so

03:25:47.070 --> 03:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:25:48.910 --> 03:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
so that that's being removed so that
 
03:25:50.950 --> 03:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's not counted twice in the budget
 
03:25:52.389 --> 03:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
because those dollars should show up
 
03:25:54.950 --> 03:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere else within the budget okay I
 
03:25:58.229 --> 03:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
see traditionally um this is a unique
 
03:26:00.510 --> 03:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
case because the opioid Batman trust
 
03:26:03.229 --> 03:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
fund is not included in the budget but
 
03:26:04.870 --> 03:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
when I had conversations with the
 
03:26:07.030 --> 03:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
03:26:09.030 --> 03:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
they verified that it should be showing
 
03:26:12.550 --> 03:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
up that way okay thank you
 
03:26:14.950 --> 03:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative Neno for a question quick
 
03:26:16.990 --> 03:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
qu quick question on the
 
03:26:18.910 --> 03:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh page 41 where we're looking at the
 
03:26:21.710 --> 03:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
housing and shelter program and it says
 
03:26:24.269 --> 03:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
20% other funds is that what we're just
 
03:26:25.590 --> 03:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
talking about here with the with the
 
03:26:27.950 --> 03:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
five million oh okay that's what I
 
03:26:29.790 --> 03:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
thought it was thank you representative
 
03:26:33.710 --> 03:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
seaworth thank you very much um I'd like
 
03:26:38.030 --> 03:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
to look back up uh the line 72 74102
 
03:26:40.710 --> 03:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
with the asterisk um it looks like
 
03:26:43.309 --> 03:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
there's been some movement between lines
 
03:26:45.550 --> 03:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to understand what stayed
 
03:26:59.229 --> 03:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:59.239 --> 03:27:03.110 align:start position:0%
 
there

03:27:03.110 --> 03:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:08.950 --> 03:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
so if you look at class
 
03:27:12.830 --> 03:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
103 there's there's or excuse me class
 
03:27:17.030 --> 03:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
102 you see uh 4.9 million adjusted
 
03:27:19.070 --> 03:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
authorized and then when you scroll over
 
03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
you see
 
03:27:26.030 --> 03:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
7.9 next to that SB 406 uh appropriated
 
03:27:30.389 --> 03:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
$2.5 million of General funds and when
 
03:27:32.710 --> 03:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
we prepare our budget we prepare we do
 
03:27:34.790 --> 03:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
the the reconciliation the history for
 
03:27:37.790 --> 03:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
the adjusted authorized in August and
 
03:27:39.710 --> 03:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
the I don't believe the legislation
 
03:27:41.590 --> 03:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
either there was a delay in signature
 
03:27:43.830 --> 03:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't always take effect July 1 and
 
03:27:46.189 --> 03:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
then there's also a process after that
 
03:27:47.269 --> 03:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
where we go to the Department of
 
03:27:49.710 --> 03:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
administrative services with a memo to
 
03:27:52.030 --> 03:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
accept those dollars into our budget so
 
03:27:54.910 --> 03:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
the $2.5 million is not being recognized
 
03:27:57.469 --> 03:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
there what's also not being recognized
 
03:27:58.750 --> 03:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
there is the
 
03:28:01.070 --> 03:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
$500,000 that was added for the use
 
03:28:04.670 --> 03:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
shelter program that we were just
 
03:28:08.630 --> 03:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
discussing and let me see here and then
 
03:28:08.640 --> 03:28:13.830 align:start position:0%
discussing and let me see here and then
[Music]

03:28:13.830 --> 03:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:19.670 --> 03:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:22.950 --> 03:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
and I would have to dig into let's see
 
03:28:24.870 --> 03:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
here and
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
then there's also some movement
 
03:28:35.469 --> 03:28:35.479 align:start position:0%
from from class 74 so class 74 I'm I'm
 
03:28:37.110 --> 03:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
going to go on kind of it's kind of an
 
03:28:38.950 --> 03:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
esoteric subject but it's important for
 
03:28:40.590 --> 03:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
this committee to
 
03:28:44.469 --> 03:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
understand when when we receive federal
 
03:28:48.349 --> 03:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
dollars we have to make a determination
 
03:28:50.990 --> 03:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
when we enter into an agreement as to
 
03:28:54.110 --> 03:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
whether it should be considered a
 
03:28:57.750 --> 03:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
subrecipient or a contractor
 
03:29:00.870 --> 03:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
simplistically a subrecipient provides
 
03:29:04.269 --> 03:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
services on behalf of the department and
 
03:29:08.030 --> 03:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
under 2 CFR 2 200 through 31 there's
 
03:29:11.309 --> 03:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
certain criteria that are used to make a
 
03:29:14.790 --> 03:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
determination on that and we need to
 
03:29:17.189 --> 03:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
track that approach appropriately and so
 
03:29:19.309 --> 03:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
we use different class Lines within the
 
03:29:21.990 --> 03:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
budget to to make sure that if it's uh
 
03:29:23.309 --> 03:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
if it's federal funds and they're a
 
03:29:24.870 --> 03:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
subrecipient we need to track those in a
 
03:29:27.910 --> 03:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
certain class line versus a contractor
 
03:29:33.030 --> 03:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh a contractor is um a scenario where
 
03:29:35.309 --> 03:29:35.319 align:start position:0%
they provide services to the department
 
03:29:37.229 --> 03:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
so that may be like they're building a
 
03:29:38.910 --> 03:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
website for us they're maintaining a
 
03:29:41.110 --> 03:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
system for us that that's the simplistic
 
03:29:42.590 --> 03:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
way to to think about those two
 
03:29:44.469 --> 03:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
determinations so I know that there is
 
03:29:46.429 --> 03:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
some movement between those lines for
 
03:29:49.469 --> 03:29:49.479 align:start position:0%
that purpose to reconcile uh some of
 
03:29:53.189 --> 03:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
that as well but um if you'd want a more
 
03:29:55.870 --> 03:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
detailed history or or crosswalk I mean
 
03:29:59.830 --> 03:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
we can do that as well similar to uh to
 
03:30:01.630 --> 03:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
what we discussed yesterday on another
 
03:30:05.870 --> 03:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
topic thank you mostly I wanted um the
 
03:30:07.070 --> 03:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
high level
 
03:30:09.429 --> 03:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
explanation uh that you gave and and
 
03:30:12.469 --> 03:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't know other members
 
03:30:16.030 --> 03:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
may may be interested in the details
 
03:30:17.590 --> 03:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I I just think it would be helpful
 
03:30:19.950 --> 03:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
to if that's included in the crosswalk
 
03:30:22.910 --> 03:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
exercise that we're doing to kind of
 
03:30:26.830 --> 03:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
help clarify what's moving
 
03:30:30.510 --> 03:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
where sure we we can do one for for this
 
03:30:32.910 --> 03:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
accounting unit as well and easy
 
03:30:32.920 --> 03:30:34.550 align:start position:0%
accounting unit as well and easy
representative

03:30:34.550 --> 03:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:30:37.070 --> 03:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
priest thank you madam chairman my
 
03:30:39.550 --> 03:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
question was align with my fellow
 
03:30:41.910 --> 03:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative so it's been answered
 
03:30:41.920 --> 03:30:42.950 align:start position:0%
representative so it's been answered
thank

03:30:42.950 --> 03:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:30:46.389 --> 03:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
you all set
 
03:30:49.750 --> 03:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay oh representative tersi sort of
 
03:30:53.030 --> 03:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
circling back to sp46 and the increase
 
03:30:55.590 --> 03:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
rates for daily rates for the beds um I
 
03:30:59.670 --> 03:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
believe we increased it to $27 a day um
 
03:31:03.110 --> 03:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
do we have do you I don't expect you to
 
03:31:05.830 --> 03:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
have hard numbers but any idea on the
 
03:31:07.990 --> 03:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
impact of that and if it was helpful to
 
03:31:08.000 --> 03:31:08.870 align:start position:0%
impact of that and if it was helpful to
the

03:31:08.870 --> 03:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:31:11.389 --> 03:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
providers knowing it's probably still
 
03:31:15.189 --> 03:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
short yes and yes um the impact was
 
03:31:20.590 --> 03:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
great um as we heard um they just the
 
03:31:22.830 --> 03:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
increased cost that they have for
 
03:31:24.830 --> 03:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
everything like we have all experience
 
03:31:27.750 --> 03:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
with electricity and food and all of
 
03:31:30.830 --> 03:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
that that helped um offset some of those
 
03:31:33.189 --> 03:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
costs as well as Staffing and they
 
03:31:36.590 --> 03:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
talked about um the need for maintaining
 
03:31:39.510 --> 03:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
staff um and how they could use those
 
03:31:42.790 --> 03:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
funds to do that so yes it did have a
 
03:31:46.110 --> 03:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
good impact um I'm sure that they could
 
03:31:49.750 --> 03:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
use more because I think that um $27 a
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
day is still um lower than what they
 
03:31:57.070 --> 03:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
expend um and they do significant uh
 
03:31:59.870 --> 03:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
fundraising for the remaining of those
 
03:32:02.110 --> 03:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
funds and other grants that they get
 
03:32:04.150 --> 03:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
from the community but it did make a
 
03:32:05.590 --> 03:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
difference and it made a difference
 
03:32:07.309 --> 03:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
enough that that's why we asked for the
 
03:32:09.750 --> 03:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
prioritized need and most importantly
 
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
why the governor recognized that to that
 
03:32:14.790 --> 03:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
it was really important to maintain that
 
03:32:18.030 --> 03:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
rate the that's good to hear um do you
 
03:32:20.830 --> 03:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts about people who
 
03:32:23.670 --> 03:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
aren't being able aren't being served
 
03:32:28.229 --> 03:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
and any even anecdotal stories um in
 
03:32:30.550 --> 03:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
general areas of people who can't be
 
03:32:33.550 --> 03:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
served because there's no
 
03:32:36.550 --> 03:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
openings I would um defer to the
 
03:32:39.110 --> 03:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
providers to be able to talk about um
 
03:32:41.150 --> 03:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
these circumstances under which someone
 
03:32:44.830 --> 03:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
is not able to um receive uh the
 
03:32:47.309 --> 03:32:47.319 align:start position:0%
services and be able to have a bed so to
 
03:32:49.590 --> 03:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
speak um because they're going to be on
 
03:32:52.309 --> 03:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
the front line and be able to have that
 
03:32:56.429 --> 03:32:56.439 align:start position:0%
um and I think that um continuing these
 
03:32:59.550 --> 03:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
rates is a way to ensure that the beds
 
03:33:03.510 --> 03:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
that we do fund 934 of them are
 
03:33:06.269 --> 03:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
available and that we don't lose uh
 
03:33:10.189 --> 03:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
ground thank you representative priest
 
03:33:12.590 --> 03:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chairman and thank you
 
03:33:16.710 --> 03:33:16.720 align:start position:0%

something about you're receiving a HUD
 
03:33:23.910 --> 03:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
funds where's is that uh on the budget
 
03:33:27.229 --> 03:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
you mentioned 5 thou $5 million or
 
03:33:30.070 --> 03:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
something you wish so I didn't site a
 
03:33:35.830 --> 03:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
number um and the um we do receive um
 
03:33:41.830 --> 03:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
HUD funding um for our sis or uh our
 
03:33:44.910 --> 03:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
um blanking on the community of care the
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
COC funds Continuum of Care funds from
 
03:33:52.590 --> 03:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
HUD and we receive some um other
 
03:33:55.469 --> 03:33:55.479 align:start position:0%
funding I don't know if um Nathan could
 
03:33:57.750 --> 03:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
um specify where it is and it shows up
 
03:33:59.590 --> 03:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
in the budget book um but we're going to
 
03:34:01.309 --> 03:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more about that as we
 
03:34:03.990 --> 03:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
go through uh the bureau sure it's it's
 
03:34:07.630 --> 03:34:07.640 align:start position:0%
on page 102 okay the the the federal
 
03:34:11.189 --> 03:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
funds line there is is the um continu of
 
03:34:15.590 --> 03:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
care and uh ESG dollars there so that
 
03:34:17.790 --> 03:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
would would include Medicaid and HUD
 
03:34:19.950 --> 03:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
funding is there any other Federal
 
03:34:22.110 --> 03:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
funding in that there there there's
 
03:34:23.870 --> 03:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
there's no Medicaid dollars there no
 
03:34:28.990 --> 03:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:32.670 --> 03:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
oh so that 11 million is all HUD is that
 
03:34:35.469 --> 03:34:35.479 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
03:34:38.389 --> 03:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
Umar Sam show up there I I believe there
 
03:34:40.469 --> 03:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
there's a small portion of other federal
 
03:34:43.429 --> 03:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
funds but um the vast majority of it is
 
03:34:46.189 --> 03:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
HUD funding um
 
03:34:51.110 --> 03:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
this particular uh contract has uh I
 
03:34:52.950 --> 03:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
don't know off the top of my head but
 
03:34:56.790 --> 03:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
probably north of 30 or 40 different
 
03:34:58.990 --> 03:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
contracts um that are that are funded
 
03:35:01.830 --> 03:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
out of this and some of those are coming
 
03:35:04.910 --> 03:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh through HUD for the Continuum of Care
 
03:35:07.469 --> 03:35:07.479 align:start position:0%
and those um there's some small Grant
 
03:35:09.510 --> 03:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
dollars there's also some hopwa dollars
 
03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
in there as well um that have very
 
03:35:14.510 --> 03:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
specific requirements and they're on
 
03:35:17.110 --> 03:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
different time frames and Grant periods
 
03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
and and you'll see those go through GNC
 
03:35:23.070 --> 03:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
uh two three times a year depending on
 
03:35:25.510 --> 03:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
how many updates we we have to those
 
03:35:27.990 --> 03:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
those Awards okay thank you very much
 
03:35:34.030 --> 03:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:37.950 --> 03:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
clarification all right um so I on slide
 
03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
42 the UN numbered page uh really
 
03:35:45.070 --> 03:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
talking about the service system um
 
03:35:46.790 --> 03:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking at at Community Education
 
03:35:50.429 --> 03:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
and awareness the entry point for
 
03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
homeless Services is
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
211 um and so people are able to access
 
03:35:59.229 --> 03:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
housing and homeless Services through
 
03:36:03.349 --> 03:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
that and then we have the Continuum of
 
03:36:07.790 --> 03:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
Care that supports a coordinated entry
 
03:36:11.590 --> 03:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
system and we have what many of you are
 
03:36:14.630 --> 03:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
aware of uh is the point in time uh
 
03:36:18.830 --> 03:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
homeless count um that we do on a
 
03:36:22.590 --> 03:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
particular day in January and we um use
 
03:36:26.710 --> 03:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
those numbers uh to establish funding uh
 
03:36:29.590 --> 03:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the state for our shelter
 
03:36:33.590 --> 03:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
programs so it's an very important count
 
03:36:35.670 --> 03:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
um that many people are involved in at
 
03:36:38.630 --> 03:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
the at the community and Regional
 
03:36:41.150 --> 03:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
level we have prevention and early
 
03:36:43.710 --> 03:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
intervention so housing
 
03:36:46.750 --> 03:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
stabilization which um provides
 
03:36:49.349 --> 03:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
shortterm rental assistance and
 
03:36:49.359 --> 03:36:52.269 align:start position:0%
shortterm rental assistance and
supportive

03:36:52.269 --> 03:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:56.750 --> 03:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
services repres to ask a question nenco
 
03:36:59.229 --> 03:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
just as a you know a point of Interest
 
03:37:02.550 --> 03:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
point in time how is that how is that
 
03:37:05.269 --> 03:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
conducted that's a very good question so
 
03:37:08.469 --> 03:37:08.479 align:start position:0%
all of the shelters and our Outreach
 
03:37:13.630 --> 03:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
workers um are asked to participate and
 
03:37:15.630 --> 03:37:15.640 align:start position:0%
um they
 
03:37:18.510 --> 03:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
they report out on how many people are
 
03:37:21.630 --> 03:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
in their shelters um and then we have
 
03:37:24.070 --> 03:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
the Outreach that looks at unhoused
 
03:37:27.150 --> 03:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
individuals as well people who aren't in
 
03:37:29.030 --> 03:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
any shelter who yeah so for example I
 
03:37:30.950 --> 03:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
know in the Keen area there's some you
 
03:37:33.710 --> 03:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
know encampments and and and that sort
 
03:37:35.710 --> 03:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
of thing so how are you you know so
 
03:37:37.269 --> 03:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
there how are you picking those numbers
 
03:37:41.070 --> 03:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
up it it is amazing how our communities
 
03:37:44.070 --> 03:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
know who and the Rapport that they have
 
03:37:46.550 --> 03:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
with those individuals so able to go out
 
03:37:49.229 --> 03:37:49.239 align:start position:0%
and and have those um and and account
 
03:37:53.469 --> 03:37:53.479 align:start position:0%
for individuals who aren't in a homeless
 
03:37:56.870 --> 03:37:56.880 align:start position:0%

03:38:14.630 --> 03:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
again we have four um centers that have
 
03:38:16.389 --> 03:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
that specific
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
specialization with those
 
03:38:23.110 --> 03:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
workers um and then um that's funded as
 
03:38:25.790 --> 03:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
we said in the path grant that you saw
 
03:38:27.429 --> 03:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
in the accounting
 
03:38:31.229 --> 03:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
unit the Continuum of Care funded
 
03:38:34.349 --> 03:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
projects so they provide permanent
 
03:38:37.910 --> 03:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
supported housing rapid rehousing which
 
03:38:41.670 --> 03:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
is we get somebody quickly um into
 
03:38:45.229 --> 03:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
housing um and keep them in housing we
 
03:38:47.790 --> 03:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
have youth transitional
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
housing and that was a specific Grant um
 
03:38:54.870 --> 03:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
and then we have the um homeless
 
03:38:57.309 --> 03:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
management information system that's our
 
03:39:00.269 --> 03:39:00.279 align:start position:0%
data platform and that all of our
 
03:39:03.070 --> 03:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
contracted providers submitt data to us
 
03:39:06.510 --> 03:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
so that we are able to break down um you
 
03:39:07.750 --> 03:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
know age
 
03:39:11.189 --> 03:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
demographics and gender and really uh
 
03:39:14.630 --> 03:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
see what's happening in that um in the
 
03:39:14.640 --> 03:39:16.150 align:start position:0%
see what's happening in that um in the
homeless

03:39:16.150 --> 03:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
homeless
 
03:39:19.510 --> 03:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
system and then we have again homeless
 
03:39:22.269 --> 03:39:22.279 align:start position:0%
prevention we'll go more into this um
 
03:39:27.510 --> 03:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:33.110 --> 03:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
reach right so we are at page
 
03:39:36.870 --> 03:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
43 this goes more into point in time and
 
03:39:41.309 --> 03:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
how that is counted um and we do go
 
03:39:43.110 --> 03:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
through a period of time everyone uh
 
03:39:45.870 --> 03:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
starts calling us um in February asking
 
03:39:48.150 --> 03:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
what the count was for this year we do
 
03:39:50.229 --> 03:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
go through a cleaning of the data to
 
03:39:52.630 --> 03:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not duplicating
 
03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
data and that we're UND duplicating it
 
03:39:57.269 --> 03:39:57.279 align:start position:0%
so it takes a little bit for us to
 
03:40:00.550 --> 03:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
actually have that count and we do use
 
03:40:03.510 --> 03:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
that count in formulas for how we're
 
03:40:06.189 --> 03:40:06.199 align:start position:0%
going to allocate funds um to our
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
shelter programs in our uh winter
 
03:40:13.510 --> 03:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:15.469 --> 03:40:15.479 align:start position:0%
Sheltering representative ters ask you
 
03:40:16.389 --> 03:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
for a
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
question can you um explain to me I
 
03:40:21.950 --> 03:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
understand you people who are sheltered
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
you have to have a bed to be sheltered
 
03:40:30.309 --> 03:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
right so the the drop from 2023 to 24
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
that wasn't necessarily A Drop in beds
 
03:40:37.269 --> 03:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
available it was a drop in persons
 
03:40:39.389 --> 03:40:39.399 align:start position:0%
utilizing those beds
 
03:40:42.269 --> 03:40:42.279 align:start position:0%
correct or am I wrong no I think I
 
03:40:43.309 --> 03:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
understand your question and I think
 
03:40:54.429 --> 03:40:54.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:56.630 --> 03:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay representative priest for a
 
03:40:59.229 --> 03:40:59.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chairman on
 
03:41:01.550 --> 03:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
that same chart on
 
03:41:05.790 --> 03:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
43 can you explain why there was this
 
03:41:08.550 --> 03:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
sharp rise in
 
03:41:12.510 --> 03:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
2023 followed by
 
03:41:17.750 --> 03:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
2024 sure so we had um the housing
 
03:41:20.110 --> 03:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
program that was through the federal
 
03:41:22.870 --> 03:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
government that uh provided the funding
 
03:41:24.990 --> 03:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
for I forgot what the name of the
 
03:41:26.590 --> 03:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
program was so I'm sure people are
 
03:41:28.309 --> 03:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
shouting behind me and I'm going to get
 
03:41:31.910 --> 03:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
all kinds of uh messages but there was
 
03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
the um housing program that was run
 
03:41:37.990 --> 03:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
through the cap agencies okay that um
 
03:41:41.630 --> 03:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
then that program wound down so that um
 
03:41:44.830 --> 03:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
is where we did not have um so we had
 
03:41:47.990 --> 03:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
people that were counted as um sheltered
 
03:41:49.710 --> 03:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
that became
 
03:41:53.630 --> 03:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
unsheltered um in the next count and so
 
03:41:57.670 --> 03:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
um that was rentals and hotels and uh
 
03:41:59.790 --> 03:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
different types of solutions that were
 
03:42:01.189 --> 03:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
were um
 
03:42:03.149 --> 03:42:03.159 align:start position:0%
made okay thank you very much
 
03:42:05.309 --> 03:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for question
 
03:42:07.349 --> 03:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
since uh since these counts are done in
 
03:42:10.790 --> 03:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
odd years and in January uh will has the
 
03:42:14.910 --> 03:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
20 uh 25 uh census been completed is it
 
03:42:14.920 --> 03:42:16.510 align:start position:0%
20 uh 25 uh census been completed is it
a

03:42:16.510 --> 03:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:42:18.870 --> 03:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
yes and as I said it usually takes us a
 
03:42:21.030 --> 03:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
few months to clean the data and to get
 
03:42:22.790 --> 03:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
it um
 
03:42:25.269 --> 03:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
unduplicated and so we will get
 
03:42:28.510 --> 03:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
preliminary numbers soon in the next
 
03:42:31.349 --> 03:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
probably by April um they're not usually
 
03:42:33.630 --> 03:42:33.640 align:start position:0%
published until later in the year but we
 
03:42:36.670 --> 03:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
start sharing what those uh numbers are
 
03:42:40.070 --> 03:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
the um unofficial numbers as um soon as
 
03:42:43.710 --> 03:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
we feel comfortable being able to so I I
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
don't have that information for you to
 
03:42:47.389 --> 03:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
today unfortunately yeah I I don't know
 
03:42:50.269 --> 03:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
if you've glanced at it but it you know
 
03:42:53.830 --> 03:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
preliminarily unofficial not finished uh
 
03:42:55.149 --> 03:42:55.159 align:start position:0%
is there anything in there that you
 
03:42:59.110 --> 03:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
think might be um uh valuable to those
 
03:43:00.830 --> 03:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
of us on finance
 
03:43:03.670 --> 03:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
committee I literally have not seen any
 
03:43:05.670 --> 03:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
numbers so I don't know and I haven't
 
03:43:09.510 --> 03:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
heard even um reports so um I don't have
 
03:43:12.429 --> 03:43:12.439 align:start position:0%
information to share with you
 
03:43:15.630 --> 03:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
today probably before the um budget
 
03:43:19.990 --> 03:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
wraps up um then we'll have we'll have
 
03:43:20.000 --> 03:43:24.910 align:start position:0%
wraps up um then we'll have we'll have
that

03:43:24.910 --> 03:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:29.429 --> 03:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
number okay all right so page
 
03:43:32.670 --> 03:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
44 so this is the homelessness
 
03:43:37.030 --> 03:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
prevention and this is a way to catch
 
03:43:40.309 --> 03:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
people before they lose their housing um
 
03:43:42.670 --> 03:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
and so there's rental assistance and
 
03:43:45.269 --> 03:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
Supportive Services the ideas if you
 
03:43:49.550 --> 03:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
keep somebody housed um then they uh can
 
03:43:53.070 --> 03:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
go on and have um that more
 
03:43:55.149 --> 03:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency whereas if they lose
 
03:43:57.630 --> 03:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
housing it is so hard for them to gain
 
03:44:02.269 --> 03:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
it back um in any way shape or form so
 
03:44:03.790 --> 03:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
we have these
 
03:44:07.189 --> 03:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
projects um and you can see the numbers
 
03:44:11.149 --> 03:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
that have been served by that um and you
 
03:44:13.229 --> 03:44:13.239 align:start position:0%
can see the age de
 
03:44:16.630 --> 03:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
demographics and that ties back to that
 
03:44:18.710 --> 03:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
really important data management system
 
03:44:21.469 --> 03:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
that we have um so that's how we're able
 
03:44:24.790 --> 03:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
to share this information with you and
 
03:44:27.670 --> 03:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
then we have the exits from this program
 
03:44:30.550 --> 03:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
to permanent housing um which is at a
 
03:44:36.950 --> 03:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:43.870 --> 03:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
45 so we continue to talk about the
 
03:44:48.790 --> 03:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
prevention um um and these oh I'm sorry
 
03:44:50.510 --> 03:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
this is the duplication that I was
 
03:44:53.630 --> 03:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
talking about Pages 44 and 45 are the
 
03:44:55.710 --> 03:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
same exact and in the meantime we have a
 
03:44:58.149 --> 03:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
question by representative priest great
 
03:45:01.070 --> 03:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Madam chairman and thank
 
03:45:05.349 --> 03:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question how do you um
 
03:45:07.790 --> 03:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
eliminate the duplication on your
 
03:45:11.189 --> 03:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
homeless numbers from the state and
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
versus the local
 
03:45:16.830 --> 03:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
um cuz person may be facing homeless he
 
03:45:20.309 --> 03:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
goes to his wh Ware officer of the
 
03:45:22.590 --> 03:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
community and we don't is that
 
03:45:25.149 --> 03:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
coordinated yeah so it's a coordinated
 
03:45:27.149 --> 03:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
approach um the state doesn't do the
 
03:45:29.030 --> 03:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
count the communities do the count so
 
03:45:31.469 --> 03:45:31.479 align:start position:0%
that's another way to um have that
 
03:45:35.189 --> 03:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
quality assurance um but to the actual
 
03:45:37.670 --> 03:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
matching um and determinations of
 
03:45:39.790 --> 03:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
unduplicated I would need to check with
 
03:45:42.670 --> 03:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
my staff to see how they do that but
 
03:45:44.510 --> 03:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty rigorous process because
 
03:45:47.670 --> 03:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
you don't want to overstate or
 
03:45:53.870 --> 03:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
understate um the status of the
 
03:45:56.110 --> 03:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
population representative walner for a
 
03:46:00.110 --> 03:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you so I noticed
 
03:46:03.870 --> 03:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
on page 44 that you have it broken down
 
03:46:06.110 --> 03:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
by age for the homeless
 
03:46:09.070 --> 03:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
prevention but I wondered if on on the
 
03:46:12.590 --> 03:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
point of time count do you count
 
03:46:15.389 --> 03:46:15.399 align:start position:0%
children do you have a count of how many
 
03:46:17.790 --> 03:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
children how many adults yes you do and
 
03:46:20.790 --> 03:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
families yes thank you representative
 
03:46:23.630 --> 03:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
tarki for a question how do you handle
 
03:46:25.830 --> 03:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
situations where homeless family may be
 
03:46:29.910 --> 03:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
living in a hotel or a motel or or with
 
03:46:31.790 --> 03:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
family couch surfing kind of thing how
 
03:46:34.070 --> 03:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
do you even do that we do and we do it
 
03:46:35.750 --> 03:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
through the service providers so if
 
03:46:37.870 --> 03:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
they're known to the community it may be
 
03:46:41.469 --> 03:46:41.479 align:start position:0%
as mentioned Town welfare um may have um
 
03:46:44.149 --> 03:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
helped support somebody in a hotel um
 
03:46:46.670 --> 03:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
there's couch surfing that goes on and
 
03:46:49.550 --> 03:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
again we uh rely on our service
 
03:46:53.110 --> 03:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
providers our communities our um any
 
03:46:55.710 --> 03:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
touch point along the way to help us
 
03:46:57.990 --> 03:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
identify that schools are included as
 
03:47:01.269 --> 03:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
well oh good okay representative PRI for
 
03:47:04.269 --> 03:47:04.279 align:start position:0%
a question as a continuation from the
 
03:47:07.110 --> 03:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
question raised by the representative
 
03:47:10.429 --> 03:47:10.439 align:start position:0%
before me uh this also includes
 
03:47:14.149 --> 03:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
nonprofits agencies like Family Promise
 
03:47:15.389 --> 03:47:15.399 align:start position:0%
in conquer
 
03:47:18.750 --> 03:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay great thank you absolutely
 
03:47:27.070 --> 03:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:31.750 --> 03:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:36.110 --> 03:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:41.070 --> 03:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
right oh I'm sorry we're on 46 right
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah 46 I think it just started 46 okay
 
03:47:45.120 --> 03:47:46.030 align:start position:0%
yeah 46 I think it just started 46 okay
all

03:47:46.030 --> 03:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:47:48.790 --> 03:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
right um so Emergency Shelters we've
 
03:47:52.910 --> 03:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
been talking a lot about that um and um
 
03:47:56.349 --> 03:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
we do differentiate um with chronically
 
03:47:59.110 --> 03:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
homelessness which is um the length of
 
03:48:02.550 --> 03:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
time that someone has been uh homeless
 
03:48:06.830 --> 03:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
we look at families um and we look at
 
03:48:08.910 --> 03:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
Veterans as well so we do break down
 
03:48:11.990 --> 03:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
that data so that we know um that is a
 
03:48:14.149 --> 03:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
big effort that has been made across the
 
03:48:17.550 --> 03:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
state most notably nashaa and Manchester
 
03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
have uh taken steps to uh really reach
 
03:48:25.030 --> 03:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
out to that population and it has made a
 
03:48:27.870 --> 03:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
difference um in keeping those numbers
 
03:48:31.110 --> 03:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
um low and obviously we want them to be
 
03:48:33.710 --> 03:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
zero but um there has been significant
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
promise in those communities that have
 
03:48:41.590 --> 03:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:45.670 --> 03:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
population all right 47
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
question yes back in 46 When you mention
 
03:48:57.030 --> 03:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
unique households what do you mean by
 
03:49:01.030 --> 03:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
unique unique means um
 
03:49:10.750 --> 03:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:14.070 --> 03:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
individual all right so the path workers
 
03:49:17.469 --> 03:49:17.479 align:start position:0%
this is the um individuals who are at
 
03:49:19.990 --> 03:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
the community menta health centers and
 
03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
this shows their
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
statistics um and how um referrals are
 
03:49:30.429 --> 03:49:30.439 align:start position:0%
made the program uh enrollment the
 
03:49:33.110 --> 03:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
demographics um
 
03:49:37.750 --> 03:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
and um anything else about that program
 
03:49:42.030 --> 03:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
um is included here and when um they
 
03:49:55.189 --> 03:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:57.429 --> 03:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
housing all right are we ready to move
 
03:49:59.030 --> 03:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
on to the Bureau of drug and alcohol
 
03:50:01.510 --> 03:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
services our last Bureau ready to move
 
03:50:01.520 --> 03:50:05.070 align:start position:0%
services our last Bureau ready to move
on

03:50:05.070 --> 03:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:08.349 --> 03:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll go to the accounting units
 
03:50:10.349 --> 03:50:10.359 align:start position:0%
on page
 
03:50:14.389 --> 03:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
49 um the program operations there are
 
03:50:16.590 --> 03:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
no contracts that are associated with
 
03:50:19.469 --> 03:50:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:24.110 --> 03:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
Staffing the block grant um oh I'm sorry
 
03:50:26.389 --> 03:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to give the page number so
 
03:50:26.399 --> 03:50:27.670 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to give the page number so
um

03:50:27.670 --> 03:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:31.550 --> 03:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
992 is is where that starts if you want
 
03:50:38.550 --> 03:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:42.630 --> 03:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
that the um block rant so samama has two
 
03:50:44.750 --> 03:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
different block rants they have the one
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
for substance uh misuse and they have
 
03:50:50.070 --> 03:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
the one for mental health services
 
03:50:54.269 --> 03:50:54.279 align:start position:0%
you're now seeing the one that is uh for
 
03:50:56.429 --> 03:50:56.439 align:start position:0%
this program
 
03:51:00.429 --> 03:51:00.439 align:start position:0%
area and we have multiple contracts that
 
03:51:03.510 --> 03:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
um are funded uh through this and I
 
03:51:06.389 --> 03:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
again I have this list of 21 Pages worth
 
03:51:09.309 --> 03:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
of contracts and um can dig that up if
 
03:51:11.429 --> 03:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
you have specific questions about where
 
03:51:15.990 --> 03:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
the funding goes for that
 
03:51:18.910 --> 03:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
same thing with Prevention Services um
 
03:51:21.790 --> 03:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
that's General funds keeping in mind
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
with our block grant funds that we have
 
03:51:26.590 --> 03:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
to have a maintenance of effort so when
 
03:51:29.670 --> 03:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
you see that there are General funds
 
03:51:31.710 --> 03:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
that are expended those are very
 
03:51:34.630 --> 03:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
important to help support our federal
 
03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
funds in maintain that level we are able
 
03:51:40.349 --> 03:51:40.359 align:start position:0%
to claim the what we spend in general
 
03:51:43.790 --> 03:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
funds on Medicaid as part of our
 
03:51:46.750 --> 03:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort um which has been
 
03:51:50.269 --> 03:51:50.279 align:start position:0%
helpful in um maintaining um the two
 
03:51:54.550 --> 03:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
years of um keeping the same level of
 
03:51:56.309 --> 03:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
General funds that are spent over that
 
03:51:59.389 --> 03:51:59.399 align:start position:0%
two-year period to match the significant
 
03:52:02.830 --> 03:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
federal dollars representative Nano for
 
03:52:06.870 --> 03:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you madam chair um
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
this a a a general question on contracts
 
03:52:13.510 --> 03:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
and are these uh typically multi-year
 
03:52:16.510 --> 03:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
contracts or oneyear contracts with a
 
03:52:20.950 --> 03:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
with a renewal clause in them uh and are
 
03:52:24.149 --> 03:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
are I I suppose there's some performance
 
03:52:26.710 --> 03:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
metrics attached to the contract so
 
03:52:28.630 --> 03:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
maybe just take a couple of minutes to
 
03:52:33.830 --> 03:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
describe uh the whole um uh Universe of
 
03:52:38.189 --> 03:52:38.199 align:start position:0%
uh contracts absolutely so there are um
 
03:52:40.229 --> 03:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
different ways everything you mentioned
 
03:52:43.630 --> 03:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
is um a potential so we do have one-year
 
03:52:46.110 --> 03:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
contracts um depending on the funding
 
03:52:50.309 --> 03:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
source and the expectation of what we're
 
03:52:53.790 --> 03:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
buying with that contract um more likely
 
03:52:56.830 --> 03:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
for example we have treatment contracts
 
03:53:01.149 --> 03:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
um so those are your um contracts that
 
03:53:03.070 --> 03:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
when someone has either inpatient
 
03:53:05.110 --> 03:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
treatment or outpatient treatment and
 
03:53:08.630 --> 03:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
they contract with the state um and with
 
03:53:11.189 --> 03:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
this division those are more likely to
 
03:53:14.950 --> 03:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
be multi-year so that um we typic Ally
 
03:53:19.830 --> 03:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
align and do renewal options with our
 
03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
state funding so with your budget with a
 
03:53:25.750 --> 03:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
two-year budget um we look and we know
 
03:53:27.830 --> 03:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
that we can put those funds into
 
03:53:30.349 --> 03:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
contract and then we have renewal
 
03:53:33.030 --> 03:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
options that can be adjusted based on
 
03:53:36.670 --> 03:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
the level of funds that we have we um
 
03:53:40.870 --> 03:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
know the burden that is placed on our
 
03:53:44.950 --> 03:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
providers from um having to contract
 
03:53:47.149 --> 03:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
um and what that process is like it's
 
03:53:48.790 --> 03:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
pretty uh
 
03:53:52.189 --> 03:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
intense um and so we try to have
 
03:53:55.349 --> 03:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
especially with contractors that we know
 
03:53:58.349 --> 03:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
have good performance outcomes and uh
 
03:54:01.229 --> 03:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
meet our metrics and meet our their
 
03:54:04.189 --> 03:54:04.199 align:start position:0%
obligations under the contract we try to
 
03:54:07.349 --> 03:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh stretch it out Beyond two years um
 
03:54:10.389 --> 03:54:10.399 align:start position:0%
but that's that it really depends on on
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
what the contract is for and for how
 
03:54:15.750 --> 03:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
long and what funding source
 
03:54:18.349 --> 03:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:21.670 --> 03:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
you and um oversight when we're talking
 
03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
about Staffing in any one of these areas
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
that really is um how we uh oversee um
 
03:54:33.349 --> 03:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
with the staff is they have contracts so
 
03:54:37.870 --> 03:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
we have in um Bas specifically we have
 
03:54:40.990 --> 03:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
units and they oversee those um
 
03:54:43.030 --> 03:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
contracts so there is a clinical unit
 
03:54:44.389 --> 03:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
that oversees the treatment contct
 
03:54:46.830 --> 03:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
contracts there's a prevention unit that
 
03:54:50.710 --> 03:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
oversees their prevention contract so we
 
03:54:53.590 --> 03:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
have it um so that people really can be
 
03:54:56.110 --> 03:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
specialized um in knowing their
 
03:54:58.469 --> 03:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
contracts and being responsible for that
 
03:55:00.870 --> 03:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
so if I have a question about a contract
 
03:55:03.630 --> 03:55:03.640 align:start position:0%
I know who to call because that's their
 
03:55:05.750 --> 03:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
contract that they're
 
03:55:08.870 --> 03:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
overseeing and managing thank
 
03:55:11.429 --> 03:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
you representative seaworth for a
 
03:55:15.269 --> 03:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much um when I
 
03:55:16.790 --> 03:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
look at let me make sure I'm in the
 
03:55:19.110 --> 03:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
right line yeah
 
03:55:23.030 --> 03:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
3380 and that has the um
 
03:55:26.070 --> 03:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
four uh individuals overseeing those
 
03:55:28.229 --> 03:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
contracts it looks to me like the
 
03:55:31.870 --> 03:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
governor's budget reduced that to one or
 
03:55:36.110 --> 03:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
am I is it moved no so it's moved so if
 
03:55:37.469 --> 03:55:37.479 align:start position:0%
you look at page
 
03:55:42.149 --> 03:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
994 within the the 3168 sap block grant
 
03:55:45.670 --> 03:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
account you'll see 10 positions 10
 
03:55:48.550 --> 03:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
permanent classified positions there so
 
03:55:51.670 --> 03:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
four of them came from accounting unit
 
03:55:54.070 --> 03:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
3384 three of them came from accounting
 
03:55:54.080 --> 03:55:55.149 align:start position:0%
3384 three of them came from accounting
unit

03:55:55.149 --> 03:55:55.159 align:start position:0%
unit
 
03:55:57.510 --> 03:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
3380 and then three of them came from
 
03:56:00.750 --> 03:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 2070 so we we were we
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
were moving and consolidating those
 
03:56:06.189 --> 03:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
positions into a single accounting unit
 
03:56:09.750 --> 03:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
here that's 100% federal
 
03:56:13.550 --> 03:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
funds and because I was figuring out
 
03:56:15.750 --> 03:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
where I was the first accounting unit
 
03:56:18.349 --> 03:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
that the four were moved from was
 
03:56:22.590 --> 03:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
3384 3384 yeah thank you of course
 
03:56:22.600 --> 03:56:25.950 align:start position:0%
3384 3384 yeah thank you of course
representative

03:56:25.950 --> 03:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:29.309 --> 03:56:29.319 align:start position:0%
nalen yeah um just a quick uh followup
 
03:56:32.550 --> 03:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
to uh Brian's question representative
 
03:56:35.349 --> 03:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
seaworth um that'll be in this crosswalk
 
03:56:37.510 --> 03:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
exercise that that you're doing you know
 
03:56:40.389 --> 03:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
so that we can we we can prepare one for
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
this as well yeah because it's uh I
 
03:56:44.950 --> 03:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
think it'll make it much much easier for
 
03:56:48.790 --> 03:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
everybody to uh be able to track all of
 
03:56:52.710 --> 03:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
the inter departmental movements on
 
03:56:56.950 --> 03:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
these funds uh so we'd appreciate that
 
03:56:58.910 --> 03:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
yeah sure sure we we can prepare one
 
03:57:01.229 --> 03:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
specific to this as well um we we don't
 
03:57:03.349 --> 03:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
plan on preparing one for the entire
 
03:57:05.309 --> 03:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
budget but if there's specific areas
 
03:57:06.790 --> 03:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
that you're interested in please let me
 
03:57:09.110 --> 03:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
know and and I think one one kind of
 
03:57:10.910 --> 03:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
important thing I I I always try to put
 
03:57:12.510 --> 03:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
myself in your shoes and just sort of
 
03:57:14.229 --> 03:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
like imagine like how hard it is to look
 
03:57:15.550 --> 03:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
at this thing and be like oh what's
 
03:57:19.389 --> 03:57:19.399 align:start position:0%
going on here um during the year we we
 
03:57:22.149 --> 03:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
make in February of every even numbered
 
03:57:23.710 --> 03:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
year we have an opportunity to kind of
 
03:57:25.630 --> 03:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
review the way that we are accounting
 
03:57:28.070 --> 03:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
for things and and we do try to make
 
03:57:31.469 --> 03:57:31.479 align:start position:0%
changes um and and it's it's it's quite
 
03:57:33.030 --> 03:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
intentional it may be for operational
 
03:57:35.429 --> 03:57:35.439 align:start position:0%
needs it may be to isolate specific
 
03:57:36.910 --> 03:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
funding sources to make it a little
 
03:57:39.309 --> 03:57:39.319 align:start position:0%
easier to track sometimes it's auditor
 
03:57:40.670 --> 03:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
suggestion because they don't like the
 
03:57:42.670 --> 03:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
way we may mix General and federal funds
 
03:57:45.149 --> 03:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
in the same account kind of depends so
 
03:57:46.870 --> 03:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of reasons for why we
 
03:57:48.309 --> 03:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
do those things I just want to make it
 
03:57:50.149 --> 03:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
clear that like we're we're not trying
 
03:57:52.510 --> 03:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
to make it harder to follow or anything
 
03:57:53.790 --> 03:57:53.800 align:start position:0%
like that and we'll prepare whatever you
 
03:57:55.510 --> 03:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
need so you can kind of follow the
 
03:57:57.710 --> 03:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
bouncing ball yeah I think is the other
 
03:57:59.950 --> 03:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
day I said I like apples I like oranges
 
03:58:03.630 --> 03:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:06.070 --> 03:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
though representative priest for a
 
03:58:08.550 --> 03:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you Madame chairman and
 
03:58:12.110 --> 03:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um back
 
03:58:15.229 --> 03:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
to the uh
 
03:58:20.149 --> 03:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
alcoholic and substance abuse program
 
03:58:24.389 --> 03:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
um yeah the the numbers of those of the
 
03:58:27.870 --> 03:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
clients that are requesting services are
 
03:58:31.830 --> 03:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
alarming and um we me we talked about
 
03:58:35.070 --> 03:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
this briefly but what in the budget do
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
you have for Recovery houses to make
 
03:58:40.910 --> 03:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
sure that the patients that come out of
 
03:58:44.469 --> 03:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
treatment don't go back on the streets
 
03:58:47.110 --> 03:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
again and have to repeat this again and
 
03:58:50.149 --> 03:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
again and they're safe for a while until
 
03:58:54.189 --> 03:58:54.199 align:start position:0%
they can get their um their act
 
03:58:57.590 --> 03:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
together so I can take that now or um
 
03:59:00.229 --> 03:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
when we go into in the next couple
 
03:59:04.269 --> 03:59:04.279 align:start position:0%
slides um but I know that this is um an
 
03:59:08.070 --> 03:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
area of your interest in so um we have
 
03:59:11.429 --> 03:59:11.439 align:start position:0%
recovery housing um there are different
 
03:59:15.070 --> 03:59:15.080 align:start position:0%
types of recovery housing um and I can
 
03:59:19.550 --> 03:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
explain some of it um some uh right now
 
03:59:23.389 --> 03:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
and some of it is respit um some of it
 
03:59:26.110 --> 03:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
for somebody um so under the state
 
03:59:29.830 --> 03:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
opioid response Grant which you will see
 
03:59:32.189 --> 03:59:32.199 align:start position:0%
on the next slide which is under the
 
03:59:34.550 --> 03:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
accounting unit um
 
03:59:37.710 --> 03:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
7040 we have um the we had the
 
03:59:41.110 --> 03:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fund a couple of programs
 
03:59:44.950 --> 03:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
where there is respit for someone who
 
03:59:48.990 --> 03:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
calls 211 or goes through a doorway and
 
03:59:52.269 --> 03:59:52.279 align:start position:0%
is um needing treatment but can't get
 
03:59:54.670 --> 03:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
into treatment for a couple days perhaps
 
03:59:55.790 --> 03:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
because they have to get all their
 
03:59:59.670 --> 03:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
paperwork in place or they need um to
 
04:00:03.429 --> 04:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
settle matters and and get um admitted
 
04:00:05.510 --> 04:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
and during that time they can go into
 
04:00:09.950 --> 04:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
respit so that's one way um that we help
 
04:00:12.189 --> 04:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
um as people are awaiting that
 
04:00:14.590 --> 04:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
transition into treatment
 
04:00:18.790 --> 04:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
for Recovery housing we have um
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
different programs we have a certifying
 
04:00:26.030 --> 04:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
body which certifies recovery housing
 
04:00:29.070 --> 04:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
and in order for them uh a recovery
 
04:00:32.870 --> 04:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
house to get a referral um from the
 
04:00:35.670 --> 04:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
state and from the doorway they need to
 
04:00:37.710 --> 04:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
have gone through that certification
 
04:00:41.550 --> 04:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
process um so we oversee that and that
 
04:00:44.950 --> 04:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
um provides standards by which these
 
04:00:48.269 --> 04:00:48.279 align:start position:0%
recovery houses have to abide by in
 
04:00:52.670 --> 04:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
order to be referred get referrals um so
 
04:00:57.189 --> 04:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
that um so that people can um use State
 
04:01:00.830 --> 04:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
dollars to um be in that housing um
 
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
there are so many different types of
 
04:01:06.189 --> 04:01:06.199 align:start position:0%
recovery housing across the state um
 
04:01:08.830 --> 04:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
there are private entities I I think
 
04:01:10.149 --> 04:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
many of you have them in your
 
04:01:12.750 --> 04:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
communities or have heard about them in
 
04:01:16.910 --> 04:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
your districts um and um they're all
 
04:01:20.550 --> 04:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
different models um one of the other
 
04:01:23.309 --> 04:01:23.319 align:start position:0%
aspects of recovery housing any that is
 
04:01:28.590 --> 04:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
state funded um must be able to um have
 
04:01:32.269 --> 04:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
individuals who may be using medication
 
04:01:34.269 --> 04:01:34.279 align:start position:0%
for addiction treatment they have to
 
04:01:37.110 --> 04:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
allow that so if there is um a
 
04:01:39.710 --> 04:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
philosophy that people should be absent
 
04:01:43.070 --> 04:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
only including medications for addiction
 
04:01:44.830 --> 04:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
treatment then we're not going to be
 
04:01:49.349 --> 04:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
able to support them in those funds um
 
04:01:52.070 --> 04:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
and I'll stop
 
04:01:55.269 --> 04:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
there thank you representative tersi for
 
04:01:58.830 --> 04:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
a question thank you um I'm looking at
 
04:02:02.710 --> 04:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
the Prevention Services
 
04:02:04.910 --> 04:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
3380 I don't know if we've quite gotten
 
04:02:08.030 --> 04:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
there in your your line but we're sort
 
04:02:11.309 --> 04:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
of talking about this um the bottom of
 
04:02:15.110 --> 04:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
um the budget page 995 they're is um
 
04:02:17.189 --> 04:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
organization notes with uh four
 
04:02:19.750 --> 04:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
different organizations I was um
 
04:02:21.510 --> 04:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
involved with getting that in here last
 
04:02:25.469 --> 04:02:25.479 align:start position:0%
bium so I'm a little confused by the
 
04:02:30.389 --> 04:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
asterik on line 074 and the fact that
 
04:02:32.990 --> 04:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
the note refers to class 102 so can you
 
04:02:36.750 --> 04:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
just explain if the funds from last bium
 
04:02:40.309 --> 04:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
made it into this year's budget or not
 
04:02:43.990 --> 04:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
thanks the short answer is yes okay um
 
04:02:46.670 --> 04:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
yes they did make it in so this carries
 
04:02:48.830 --> 04:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
that forward and the governor included
 
04:02:51.149 --> 04:02:51.159 align:start position:0%
it in her
 
04:02:54.790 --> 04:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
budget the there I I I just I want to
 
04:02:57.309 --> 04:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
verify this but I do believe that there
 
04:03:01.630 --> 04:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
is one subtle change it's the five
 
04:03:06.510 --> 04:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
versus um in the in the current bium
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
there were five organizations that were
 
04:03:13.469 --> 04:03:13.479 align:start position:0%
identified in the in in the in the
 
04:03:16.710 --> 04:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
original legislation and it was $40,000
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
each year for each of those
 
04:03:21.149 --> 04:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
organizations and in the current
 
04:03:23.630 --> 04:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
Governor's recommended budget um there
 
04:03:26.790 --> 04:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
are four organizations listed when
 
04:03:29.790 --> 04:03:29.800 align:start position:0%
following um the passes of chapter 106
 
04:03:32.710 --> 04:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
laws of 2023 one of the organizations
 
04:03:35.630 --> 04:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
chose not to accept the dollars and so
 
04:03:37.750 --> 04:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's been accounted for in the current
 
04:03:37.760 --> 04:03:40.990 align:start position:0%
that's been accounted for in the current
bium

04:03:40.990 --> 04:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:42.910 --> 04:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
interesting representative Stringham for
 
04:03:44.349 --> 04:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
a question
 
04:03:46.910 --> 04:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'll jump around to 3382 the
 
04:03:46.920 --> 04:03:47.950 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'll jump around to 3382 the
governor's

04:03:47.950 --> 04:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
04:03:52.510 --> 04:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
commission um in the um briefing book uh
 
04:03:57.030 --> 04:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
it talks about the number um uh being
 
04:03:59.550 --> 04:03:59.560 align:start position:0%
served uh or the case load is
 
04:04:02.030 --> 04:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
44,000 in the current bium and that
 
04:04:03.830 --> 04:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
jumps to
 
04:04:08.389 --> 04:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
60,000 um in in the um in the the budget
 
04:04:10.349 --> 04:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
that we're working on uh with
 
04:04:12.550 --> 04:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
essentially no change in authorization
 
04:04:14.670 --> 04:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
is there are we finding that there's
 
04:04:17.269 --> 04:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
less intensive services that are still
 
04:04:19.830 --> 04:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
just as effective for the people or or
 
04:04:23.830 --> 04:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
um was there tremendous un unmet uh need
 
04:04:26.670 --> 04:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
or you know what what's driving this
 
04:04:29.030 --> 04:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
change thank you for the question I'll
 
04:04:33.389 --> 04:04:33.399 align:start position:0%
bring that back to see the change um I
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
it could be in what was funded and how
 
04:04:37.830 --> 04:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
many people the reach is in that
 
04:04:41.189 --> 04:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
area sure sure um what one important
 
04:04:48.229 --> 04:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
thing about this accounting unit uh for
 
04:04:51.229 --> 04:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
for the Governor's commission funds is
 
04:04:53.269 --> 04:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
the the agency
 
04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
income this
 
04:04:59.510 --> 04:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
represents uh 5% of the gross profits of
 
04:05:00.670 --> 04:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
of the Liquor
 
04:05:03.550 --> 04:05:03.560 align:start position:0%
Commission and and and and that that
 
04:05:08.550 --> 04:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
that went into being um last last spum
 
04:05:10.830 --> 04:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
and so the these are estimated Revenue
 
04:05:13.110 --> 04:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
amounts included there based on the
 
04:05:14.389 --> 04:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
estimates that came from The Liquor
 
04:05:17.070 --> 04:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
Commission so so so so the the funding
 
04:05:20.590 --> 04:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
here is not necessarily what what might
 
04:05:22.750 --> 04:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
be the need but it's what's projected
 
04:05:24.870 --> 04:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
and that's that's uh specified in in
 
04:05:24.880 --> 04:05:26.189 align:start position:0%
and that's that's uh specified in in
State

04:05:26.189 --> 04:05:26.199 align:start position:0%
State
 
04:05:28.830 --> 04:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
law can I ask a question so I I guess
 
04:05:30.950 --> 04:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
the question I have if if the annual
 
04:05:35.070 --> 04:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
cost per case is $250 under the current
 
04:05:39.590 --> 04:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
bium and the projected is to decrease to
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
178 uh in the next
 
04:05:44.309 --> 04:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
bium you know is is that is that really
 
04:05:46.710 --> 04:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
realistically enough money for that
 
04:05:48.630 --> 04:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
those services to be provided or we
 
04:05:50.510 --> 04:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
providing different services that are
 
04:05:54.790 --> 04:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
less expensive so I think it has to do
 
04:05:56.550 --> 04:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
with the types of services that were
 
04:05:58.630 --> 04:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
funded under the governor's commission
 
04:06:02.630 --> 04:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
so if they change um their funding in
 
04:06:05.349 --> 04:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
from you know serving a 100 people and
 
04:06:08.030 --> 04:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
then they choose an initiative that
 
04:06:09.710 --> 04:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
serves a thousand people you're going to
 
04:06:11.870 --> 04:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
see that difference but let me take that
 
04:06:14.750 --> 04:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
back um these are as as Nathan said
 
04:06:18.269 --> 04:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
these are estimates um and so it may be
 
04:06:21.550 --> 04:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
that we don't end up serving 60,000 it
 
04:06:24.630 --> 04:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
may be closer to the 44 and really when
 
04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
we talk about Prevention Services those
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
are really estimated um when we talk
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
about the reach of a particular program
 
04:06:35.590 --> 04:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:37.830 --> 04:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
audience representative tersi for
 
04:06:40.510 --> 04:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you um it's my
 
04:06:42.349 --> 04:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
understanding that a few days ago
 
04:06:44.710 --> 04:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
another division was was looking into
 
04:06:47.469 --> 04:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
And discussing um the liquor fund and
 
04:06:49.790 --> 04:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
where the money goes would you speak um
 
04:06:51.269 --> 04:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
about the governor's Commission on
 
04:06:54.070 --> 04:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drugs and describe the
 
04:06:56.590 --> 04:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
oversight of those funds and and how
 
04:06:59.710 --> 04:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
they're used absolutely so the
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
governor's commission is in statute um
 
04:07:07.990 --> 04:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
and so all of its um obligations and
 
04:07:11.429 --> 04:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
what it does is defined um in that
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
statute the um
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
it is um determined who's on the
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
commission is uh listed in that statute
 
04:07:24.229 --> 04:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
so that includes appointments from um
 
04:07:28.750 --> 04:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
the governor and specific uh Le um seats
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
that are designated for example the uh
 
04:07:33.389 --> 04:07:33.399 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Health and Human
 
04:07:35.349 --> 04:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
Services the commissioner of safety the
 
04:07:37.630 --> 04:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education all sit at
 
04:07:39.950 --> 04:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
that table um people with lived
 
04:07:42.550 --> 04:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
experience their um representation from
 
04:07:42.560 --> 04:07:43.950 align:start position:0%
experience their um representation from
recovery

04:07:43.950 --> 04:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
04:07:47.630 --> 04:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh and from other types of programs
 
04:07:51.229 --> 04:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
um I serve as the executive director of
 
04:07:54.389 --> 04:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission by Statute and
 
04:07:58.109 --> 04:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
so um that
 
04:08:03.910 --> 04:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
is part of um the attachment that they
 
04:08:07.269 --> 04:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
have we we administer um the and carry
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
out the wishes of the governor's
 
04:08:14.109 --> 04:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
commission the governor's commission um
 
04:08:17.950 --> 04:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
is extremely transparent and because of
 
04:08:19.870 --> 04:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
questions that came up from fiscal
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
committee a number of years ago you will
 
04:08:27.109 --> 04:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
find in the operating statistics in the
 
04:08:29.790 --> 04:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
dashboard um for every single month of
 
04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee we provide where we are
 
04:08:37.229 --> 04:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
all the status of every single contract
 
04:08:39.189 --> 04:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
um that is funded by the governor's
 
04:08:41.870 --> 04:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
commission the governor's commission
 
04:08:45.149 --> 04:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
provides annual reports courts um we
 
04:08:49.349 --> 04:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
have a strategic plan and we have um
 
04:08:52.349 --> 04:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature who serve on
 
04:08:56.349 --> 04:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
that commission um it is a high
 
04:09:00.109 --> 04:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
functioning mature group um that not
 
04:09:05.630 --> 04:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
only um makes decisions based on um
 
04:09:09.309 --> 04:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
their own self-interest but we have had
 
04:09:11.710 --> 04:09:11.720 align:start position:0%
sessions listening sessions going out
 
04:09:14.750 --> 04:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
across the state um to hear from people
 
04:09:17.910 --> 04:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
about where they think the gaps are um
 
04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
and we just did that last year um very
 
04:09:24.429 --> 04:09:24.439 align:start position:0%
informative um and really helps us build
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
our strategic plan and Target uh dollars
 
04:09:31.750 --> 04:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
towards those gaps one of the benefits
 
04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
of the governor's commission is that its
 
04:09:37.030 --> 04:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
funds are flexible so we have we've been
 
04:09:39.710 --> 04:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
going through you know we have the block
 
04:09:41.630 --> 04:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
grant that has us set aside for a
 
04:09:43.469 --> 04:09:43.479 align:start position:0%
certain amount of dollars we have
 
04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
obligations under and all the strings
 
04:09:48.109 --> 04:09:48.119 align:start position:0%
that come with Federal funding the
 
04:09:50.189 --> 04:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
governor's commission has more
 
04:09:53.790 --> 04:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
flexibility um but it also has
 
04:09:57.790 --> 04:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
accountability um and um I I
 
04:10:02.429 --> 04:10:02.439 align:start position:0%
just think um that it is an example of
 
04:10:05.790 --> 04:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
how we can structure such commissions
 
04:10:08.469 --> 04:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
that have that funding Authority and
 
04:10:10.910 --> 04:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
that um appropriation Authority uh I
 
04:10:15.149 --> 04:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
mean a allocation Authority um um and so
 
04:10:16.590 --> 04:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
that's I hope that answered it and I
 
04:10:18.590 --> 04:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
know Nathan wants to add something yeah
 
04:10:20.670 --> 04:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
I I think one one other important thing
 
04:10:23.389 --> 04:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
to understand is once that commission
 
04:10:25.429 --> 04:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
makes their decisions on what should be
 
04:10:28.590 --> 04:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
funded katu's team members of my team
 
04:10:30.429 --> 04:10:30.439 align:start position:0%
then develop the contracts using the
 
04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
standard contract process and template
 
04:10:34.510 --> 04:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
that we use where there's performance
 
04:10:36.389 --> 04:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
metrics we look at deliverables we look
 
04:10:39.030 --> 04:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
at the payment terms and then once those
 
04:10:41.349 --> 04:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
um get approved and all of our contracts
 
04:10:43.269 --> 04:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
are scrutinized by the governor and ex
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
Ive counselors then those services are
 
04:10:47.830 --> 04:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
delivered and then they go through the
 
04:10:49.990 --> 04:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
standard monthly review process where
 
04:10:51.990 --> 04:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
we're verifying that the services are
 
04:10:54.349 --> 04:10:54.359 align:start position:0%
received and we generally do not pay
 
04:10:56.990 --> 04:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
anything for a cost reimbursement based
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
contract or other deliverable contract
 
04:11:01.630 --> 04:11:01.640 align:start position:0%
if the services um are not are not
 
04:11:03.870 --> 04:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrated and delivered so there's
 
04:11:06.309 --> 04:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
also sort of the the micro Level side of
 
04:11:08.349 --> 04:11:08.359 align:start position:0%
it both both at the global when the
 
04:11:10.189 --> 04:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
decisions are made but then once we
 
04:11:12.070 --> 04:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
actually Implement and operationalize it
 
04:11:13.389 --> 04:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
there's the same level of scrutiny
 
04:11:15.189 --> 04:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
applied to that as any of our other
 
04:11:18.349 --> 04:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
contracts and grants and we also do um
 
04:11:21.309 --> 04:11:21.319 align:start position:0%
often go out to bid for um those
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
services with um the governor's
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
commission identifying that they want a
 
04:11:29.109 --> 04:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
particular type of service um provided
 
04:11:33.750 --> 04:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
but um we we issue an RFP so that um
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
there's opportunity for um Community
 
04:11:39.870 --> 04:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
organizations to um put in their
 
04:11:41.590 --> 04:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
applications for
 
04:11:44.750 --> 04:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
that I appreciate that explanation
 
04:11:48.349 --> 04:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
so any other views that for some reason
 
04:11:50.109 --> 04:11:50.119 align:start position:0%
These funds are not being managed
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
properly it goes through data driven um
 
04:11:56.790 --> 04:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
metrics the same way other spending does
 
04:11:59.950 --> 04:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
for the Department um perhaps we just
 
04:12:01.990 --> 04:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
have to share this tape and and help
 
04:12:03.429 --> 04:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
help them better understand how that
 
04:12:05.510 --> 04:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
works so thank you for
 
04:12:09.630 --> 04:12:09.640 align:start position:0%
that representative n valeno
 
04:12:12.910 --> 04:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
foreno yeah I so that's kind of new to
 
04:12:12.920 --> 04:12:13.790 align:start position:0%
foreno yeah I so that's kind of new to
me

04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:12:17.189 --> 04:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh and I think you said 5% of the Liquor
 
04:12:20.189 --> 04:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
Commission sales are allocated to that
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
fund and so the the question is this is
 
04:12:24.910 --> 04:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
a fund that's
 
04:12:27.469 --> 04:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
constantly receiving funds I don't I I
 
04:12:30.109 --> 04:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
would assume on a monthly or a quarterly
 
04:12:35.469 --> 04:12:35.479 align:start position:0%
basis and there's a budget for the uh uh
 
04:12:38.269 --> 04:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
Governor's commission and to the extent
 
04:12:41.070 --> 04:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
that that's over under so I would assume
 
04:12:43.870 --> 04:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
that you're you're that fund always has
 
04:12:47.790 --> 04:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
a positive balance is that is that
 
04:12:52.990 --> 04:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
correct so yes um however we do again
 
04:12:56.149 --> 04:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
during that um monthly report and we um
 
04:12:58.590 --> 04:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
share this with the fiscal committee and
 
04:13:01.149 --> 04:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
we also have the dashboard that we share
 
04:13:03.510 --> 04:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
with the governor's commission that
 
04:13:06.070 --> 04:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
shows what they've what's been carried
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
forward so this is a non-aps fund what's
 
04:13:11.590 --> 04:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
been carried forward but what also has
 
04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
been obligated so they're making
 
04:13:17.070 --> 04:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
spending decisions usually twice a year
 
04:13:19.070 --> 04:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
if something unusual comes up they'll
 
04:13:22.109 --> 04:13:22.119 align:start position:0%
make um a special you know they'll do it
 
04:13:26.349 --> 04:13:26.359 align:start position:0%
in an off time um of those two meetings
 
04:13:29.950 --> 04:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
um however they
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
um we that balance is always known um
 
04:13:38.429 --> 04:13:38.439 align:start position:0%
and right now for example um with the
 
04:13:42.149 --> 04:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
anticipated funding um or the actual
 
04:13:44.070 --> 04:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
funding and the allocations that have
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
been made by the commission so it takes
 
04:13:50.349 --> 04:13:50.359 align:start position:0%
time for us to go into contract um and
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
so they may have voted to direct funds
 
04:13:56.429 --> 04:13:56.439 align:start position:0%
to a specific type of service but for us
 
04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to execute upon that may take
 
04:14:02.349 --> 04:14:02.359 align:start position:0%
several months so right now for example
 
04:14:05.630 --> 04:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
sitting here today we have about $1.4
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
million that is
 
04:14:12.189 --> 04:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
unallocated um and um that is available
 
04:14:15.429 --> 04:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
for consider ation for spending the
 
04:14:17.429 --> 04:14:17.439 align:start position:0%
commission has taken a conservative
 
04:14:19.590 --> 04:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
approach that in that it wants to have a
 
04:14:22.229 --> 04:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
little bit of a balance to account for
 
04:14:24.670 --> 04:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
an emergent situation so if we have
 
04:14:28.109 --> 04:14:28.119 align:start position:0%
something that um really needs a
 
04:14:29.710 --> 04:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
response they like to have the
 
04:14:31.910 --> 04:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be able to respond to
 
04:14:33.990 --> 04:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
that um so they don't want to spend it
 
04:14:37.550 --> 04:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
down to zero we have gone um to half a
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
million before um but yes and um from
 
04:14:44.510 --> 04:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission as as to we always
 
04:14:46.950 --> 04:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
have these replenished funds I believe
 
04:14:49.189 --> 04:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
that they make um the payments to us
 
04:14:51.030 --> 04:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
twice a
 
04:14:54.550 --> 04:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
year so so you roughly have a target for
 
04:14:57.630 --> 04:14:57.640 align:start position:0%
what you'd like to see as a unallocated
 
04:15:00.910 --> 04:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
unallocated balance at you know on on an
 
04:15:03.670 --> 04:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis again varies by whatever
 
04:15:07.070 --> 04:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
the the needs are yeah I think um it's
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
um it's not um uncommon for it to be
 
04:15:14.429 --> 04:15:14.439 align:start position:0%
around 10% but again it can dip below
 
04:15:17.109 --> 04:15:17.119 align:start position:0%
that and if there is an unmet need and
 
04:15:18.670 --> 04:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
we know there are dollars there they're
 
04:15:21.309 --> 04:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
going to allocate
 
04:15:24.670 --> 04:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
it a related question and probably
 
04:15:26.429 --> 04:15:26.439 align:start position:0%
because I haven't kept up with it but
 
04:15:28.710 --> 04:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
there was a tobacco settlement fund
 
04:15:31.349 --> 04:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
right and not is that totally gone or is
 
04:15:34.510 --> 04:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
that still something that's out there as
 
04:15:34.520 --> 04:15:44.389 align:start position:0%
that still something that's out there as
well

04:15:44.389 --> 04:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:46.269 --> 04:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
we typically do not use the T the
 
04:15:47.990 --> 04:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement funds for public
 
04:15:50.590 --> 04:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
health or other um primary Prevention
 
04:15:52.269 --> 04:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
Services there are small amounts that
 
04:15:54.750 --> 04:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
may fund individual things but as a
 
04:15:56.469 --> 04:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
whole the tobacco settlement funds
 
04:15:58.189 --> 04:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
typically go into the general fund
 
04:16:00.830 --> 04:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
although um i' I'd be happy if someone
 
04:16:03.429 --> 04:16:03.439 align:start position:0%
else uh knew more than
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:11.790 --> 04:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
you all set all right so I think we're
 
04:16:16.630 --> 04:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
still we're uh page 50 um and we're
 
04:16:18.309 --> 04:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
going through we should have said at the
 
04:16:20.469 --> 04:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
outset and I apologize because you had
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
to raise it um yourselves but we did do
 
04:16:25.349 --> 04:16:25.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of work in um cleaning up these
 
04:16:29.870 --> 04:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
accounting units because of what um uh
 
04:16:32.429 --> 04:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
Nathan said about really being able to
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
identify for Grant purposes and
 
04:16:40.070 --> 04:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
Reporting um it is much cleaner to have
 
04:16:43.389 --> 04:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
100% federal funds in an accounting unit
 
04:16:46.269 --> 04:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
and then 100% General funds and so the
 
04:16:48.710 --> 04:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
team that is here with Nathan and me
 
04:16:51.630 --> 04:16:51.640 align:start position:0%
today um took a a considerable amount of
 
04:16:54.109 --> 04:16:54.119 align:start position:0%
time to move those funds around and
 
04:16:56.429 --> 04:16:56.439 align:start position:0%
you're seeing that in your budget pages
 
04:16:58.910 --> 04:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
so I apologize for not raising that but
 
04:17:02.189 --> 04:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for noting
 
04:17:06.030 --> 04:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
it um so drug forfeiture this is when we
 
04:17:10.910 --> 04:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
get a um% of when there has been um a
 
04:17:16.349 --> 04:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
seizure and um a through um a criminal
 
04:17:20.149 --> 04:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
activity and there's the for fiter of um
 
04:17:23.389 --> 04:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
the goods so to speak those uh funds are
 
04:17:26.590 --> 04:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
given to us and put into this account by
 
04:17:29.550 --> 04:17:29.560 align:start position:0%
Statute um and so we're able to use
 
04:17:32.590 --> 04:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
those it's not a lot of money um but it
 
04:17:32.600 --> 04:17:34.510 align:start position:0%
those it's not a lot of money um but it
is

04:17:34.510 --> 04:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:17:39.109 --> 04:17:39.119 align:start position:0%
available State opioid response Grant um
 
04:17:44.389 --> 04:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
this is the funding that comes from
 
04:17:48.349 --> 04:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
SSA and this has been in play for
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
several years we are in year four of
 
04:17:57.550 --> 04:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
allocation from this uh Grant and it
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
runs around $28 million a year it is
 
04:18:06.269 --> 04:18:06.279 align:start position:0%
categorical in that we have very
 
04:18:10.149 --> 04:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
specific areas that we are allowed and
 
04:18:12.189 --> 04:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
not allowed to spend this fun these
 
04:18:13.510 --> 04:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
funds on
 
04:18:16.710 --> 04:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
one key component um that is loosened up
 
04:18:19.590 --> 04:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit but still remains is that
 
04:18:23.630 --> 04:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
it's for services for individuals with
 
04:18:30.189 --> 04:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
opioid use disorder um and so um or at
 
04:18:35.830 --> 04:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
risk um of opioid use disorder this
 
04:18:39.189 --> 04:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
funds are doorway systems uh system
 
04:18:41.469 --> 04:18:41.479 align:start position:0%
across the state so are nine doorways
 
04:18:45.790 --> 04:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
that we have um and it funds a number of
 
04:18:48.070 --> 04:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
programs um they have specific
 
04:18:50.070 --> 04:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
populations that they want to have
 
04:18:54.070 --> 04:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
addressed um including Justice involved
 
04:18:58.309 --> 04:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
and um pregnant moms um
 
04:19:02.309 --> 04:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
parenting um uh you people who are
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
parenting um and we use it in about 30
 
04:19:09.910 --> 04:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
contracts we're in the process of doing
 
04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
the renewal with the latest funding that
 
04:19:13.469 --> 04:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
we received
 
04:19:17.429 --> 04:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
in uh the last quarter of last uh
 
04:19:20.830 --> 04:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
calendar year and I can see a question
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
Brewing it's sorry it's sorry brooded
 
04:19:25.790 --> 04:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative Neno yeah I'm looking at
 
04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
a big drop in those numbers from you
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
know um on I'm on page 998 and I think
 
04:19:34.590 --> 04:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the current expenses 02
 
04:19:37.950 --> 04:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
on state opio opio response Grant goes
 
04:19:41.510 --> 04:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
from a you million four down to pretty
 
04:19:43.349 --> 04:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
much smaller numbers
 
04:19:49.229 --> 04:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:53.309 --> 04:19:53.319 align:start position:0%
that I'm on page 998 of
 
04:19:55.910 --> 04:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget just looking at
 
04:19:58.109 --> 04:19:58.119 align:start position:0%
line 20 yeah line
 
04:20:01.149 --> 04:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
20 oh that's the the the the current
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
expense line there yeah
 
04:20:03.239 --> 04:20:04.830 align:start position:0%
expense line there yeah
yeah

04:20:04.830 --> 04:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:20:04.840 --> 04:20:10.950 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

04:20:10.950 --> 04:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
C you want
 
04:20:16.550 --> 04:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
I don't think it is is it what that I
 
04:20:18.429 --> 04:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
don't think it is I don't know what
 
04:20:26.590 --> 04:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:29.630 --> 04:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
is about where did they
 
04:20:32.710 --> 04:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
go you're
 
04:20:34.990 --> 04:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
talking I think for this we're going to
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
dial a
 
04:20:39.830 --> 04:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
friend so I'm going to ask our finance
 
04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
director um for the division um um to uh
 
04:20:48.149 --> 04:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
approach and uh if Kyra Leonard could um
 
04:20:51.030 --> 04:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
help us with this
 
04:20:53.710 --> 04:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
sure she she didn't come to spend all
 
04:20:57.389 --> 04:20:57.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:59.710 --> 04:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
speaking and if you could just introduce
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
yourself for the record um Kyra Leonard
 
04:21:05.269 --> 04:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
I'm the finance director for the
 
04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health sorry
 
04:21:11.550 --> 04:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
welcome thanks um and we're looking at
 
04:21:14.990 --> 04:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
the class 20 and 74 so um the reason why
 
04:21:17.389 --> 04:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
it's so high with the actuals in um
 
04:21:20.309 --> 04:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2024 is we ended up buying
 
04:21:23.510 --> 04:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh a large amount of nooc zone for
 
04:21:25.950 --> 04:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
distribution into the community to
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
increase saturation um and then it went
 
04:21:32.309 --> 04:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
down because um we're accounting for
 
04:21:34.870 --> 04:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
buying additional but not to that
 
04:21:34.880 --> 04:21:38.229 align:start position:0%
buying additional but not to that
extent

04:21:38.229 --> 04:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:42.149 --> 04:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
so so I I think we saw this was was on
 
04:21:44.750 --> 04:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
and grants to communities across New
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that what happened
 
04:21:51.149 --> 04:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
there oh is that a question for oh yeah
 
04:21:55.070 --> 04:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:59.550 --> 04:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
question so I can answer that so um so
 
04:22:03.109 --> 04:22:03.119 align:start position:0%
we purchased n lockone and so we had n
 
04:22:06.030 --> 04:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
lockone in every doorway budget where
 
04:22:08.590 --> 04:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
they would um make their own purchases
 
04:22:11.630 --> 04:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
and then we as a state made this
 
04:22:13.389 --> 04:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
particular purchase of
 
04:22:19.750 --> 04:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
Noone uh the um reversal drug um and um
 
04:22:22.149 --> 04:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
the contracts that we're talking out uh
 
04:22:25.710 --> 04:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
about show up in other uh class lines so
 
04:22:27.189 --> 04:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
that that's something that our local
 
04:22:29.109 --> 04:22:29.119 align:start position:0%
communities would have seen so for
 
04:22:31.229 --> 04:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
example in my town we have an ambulance
 
04:22:32.670 --> 04:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
Corp and I think I remember something
 
04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
about saying that they were you um uh
 
04:22:38.710 --> 04:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
stocking everything with uh with that
 
04:22:40.510 --> 04:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
particular drug is that where that would
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
have come from so some of it yes um some
 
04:22:46.670 --> 04:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
of the private um so the communities
 
04:22:51.309 --> 04:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
already have um a variety of um
 
04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals that they need to have
 
04:22:56.710 --> 04:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
on board for an ambulance um standard
 
04:22:58.630 --> 04:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
type you know saline and different
 
04:23:02.349 --> 04:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
things that they have and so they that a
 
04:23:04.429 --> 04:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
particular ambulance may not have gotten
 
04:23:07.269 --> 04:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
the lock Zone through our distribution
 
04:23:09.349 --> 04:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
um many of our community service
 
04:23:11.870 --> 04:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
providers are the ones who are the
 
04:23:15.429 --> 04:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
recipients so um it may be a community-
 
04:23:17.950 --> 04:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
based organization we've had churches
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
we've had schools we've had um service
 
04:23:26.790 --> 04:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
providers um Welfare Offices many who
 
04:23:30.950 --> 04:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
have um utilized um the distribution and
 
04:23:35.550 --> 04:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
been able to access noock Zone that way
 
04:23:38.990 --> 04:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
so my local Ambulance Service in in
 
04:23:41.149 --> 04:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
elstead is stocked with that they could
 
04:23:43.830 --> 04:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
have gotten it either directly or via
 
04:23:45.469 --> 04:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
one of the part people we partner with
 
04:23:49.189 --> 04:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
in the community or yeah I can't um I'm
 
04:23:51.109 --> 04:23:51.119 align:start position:0%
just yeah I can't speak specifically
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's possible um but like I said they um
 
04:23:58.429 --> 04:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
some the the idea was to have it be a
 
04:24:01.229 --> 04:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
community response and for Community uh
 
04:24:03.990 --> 04:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
members for late people to have access
 
04:24:06.510 --> 04:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
to it and not those who already were
 
04:24:08.710 --> 04:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
using that um for years and years and
 
04:24:11.670 --> 04:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
years um but for your specific case you
 
04:24:13.510 --> 04:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
know we could we could find out if
 
04:24:15.109 --> 04:24:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's not necessary the good news is
 
04:24:17.429 --> 04:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
they they have it they stock it and they
 
04:24:23.349 --> 04:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:28.109 --> 04:24:28.119 align:start position:0%
yeah all right anything else um in these
 
04:24:28.119 --> 04:24:34.750 align:start position:0%
yeah all right anything else um in these
accounting

04:24:34.750 --> 04:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:37.990 --> 04:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
units looks like we'll move on
 
04:24:41.349 --> 04:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
okay um so now we're at the unnumbered
 
04:24:41.359 --> 04:24:44.109 align:start position:0%
okay um so now we're at the unnumbered
51

04:24:44.109 --> 04:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
51
 
04:24:47.429 --> 04:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
um similar uh structure as we've had
 
04:24:50.670 --> 04:24:50.680 align:start position:0%
with the previous bureaus talking about
 
04:24:52.710 --> 04:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
um everything from Community Education
 
04:24:56.950 --> 04:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
and awareness up to the crisis level of
 
04:25:00.590 --> 04:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
service um we have the 2on one we have
 
04:25:02.429 --> 04:25:02.439 align:start position:0%
the regional public health networks
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
there are 13 um that we partner with
 
04:25:10.030 --> 04:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
Public Health in helping support and and
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
they in turn um are the Regional hub for
 
04:25:16.550 --> 04:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
these types of services in doing
 
04:25:20.269 --> 04:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
community assessments and identifying
 
04:25:23.750 --> 04:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
needs um and they help coordinate
 
04:25:25.510 --> 04:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
services in their
 
04:25:28.510 --> 04:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
regions we have the juvenile court
 
04:25:28.520 --> 04:25:31.830 align:start position:0%
regions we have the juvenile court
diversion

04:25:31.830 --> 04:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:35.710 --> 04:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
programs there is prevention and early
 
04:25:38.109 --> 04:25:38.119 align:start position:0%
intervention and this is starting to go
 
04:25:40.510 --> 04:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
up the scale so you have assessments you
 
04:25:43.510 --> 04:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
have youth prevention projects if you've
 
04:25:45.990 --> 04:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh Governor's commission has had a
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
couple of Youth groups present um on the
 
04:25:51.229 --> 04:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
funding that they've received and being
 
04:25:52.990 --> 04:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
able to share with us the work that they
 
04:25:54.910 --> 04:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
do in their communities it's incredible
 
04:25:57.070 --> 04:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
so if you ever get a chance to go to
 
04:25:59.469 --> 04:25:59.479 align:start position:0%
your local middle or high school and see
 
04:26:01.349 --> 04:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
some of their prevention programs I
 
04:26:03.710 --> 04:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
highly encourage it um because it's
 
04:26:08.510 --> 04:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
really um uh hopeful and um positive um
 
04:26:11.830 --> 04:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
impact on the school the students and
 
04:26:13.950 --> 04:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
the community ities representative
 
04:26:15.109 --> 04:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
priest for a
 
04:26:17.469 --> 04:26:17.479 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chairman and
 
04:26:20.269 --> 04:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question back to
 
04:26:22.990 --> 04:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
Community Education and awareness could
 
04:26:25.070 --> 04:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
you just walk me through the juvenile
 
04:26:28.389 --> 04:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
court diversion program that you have
 
04:26:30.630 --> 04:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with it yeah so there
 
04:26:33.429 --> 04:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
are community- based organizations that
 
04:26:39.389 --> 04:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
have um uh programs that really look at
 
04:26:43.109 --> 04:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
um youth who are at risk of higher
 
04:26:46.149 --> 04:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
levels of um criminal justice
 
04:26:48.269 --> 04:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
involvement and this is a way to
 
04:26:51.510 --> 04:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
identify them and divert them from um
 
04:26:55.950 --> 04:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
that that um additional um level
 
04:27:01.109 --> 04:27:01.119 align:start position:0%
of um involvement um and so um I can get
 
04:27:03.550 --> 04:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
you more information about the specific
 
04:27:05.790 --> 04:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
programs um but that's really what that
 
04:27:08.429 --> 04:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
program is we have several community-
 
04:27:10.269 --> 04:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
based organizations and they're part of
 
04:27:14.070 --> 04:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
a network and um this is something that
 
04:27:18.149 --> 04:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
the DCF field staff um are and the um
 
04:27:21.389 --> 04:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
and Juvenile Justice I believe
 
04:27:24.870 --> 04:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
um uh director Nunan um would be able to
 
04:27:31.429 --> 04:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:34.990 --> 04:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
programs uh peer recovery and uh peers
 
04:27:37.830 --> 04:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
and Recovery supports so we have two
 
04:27:41.630 --> 04:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
different peer systems in our division
 
04:27:43.910 --> 04:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
so we have we talked about the mental
 
04:27:47.790 --> 04:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
health peer uh uh organizations and we
 
04:27:51.309 --> 04:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
have them in substance misuse as well
 
04:27:54.670 --> 04:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
and so these are the known as the
 
04:27:59.510 --> 04:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
rcos um we have um funding specifically
 
04:28:01.189 --> 04:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
for those
 
04:28:05.309 --> 04:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
organizations they um there are I forget
 
04:28:07.590 --> 04:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
how many locations um I know it says
 
04:28:12.229 --> 04:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
four contracts here we um have um a
 
04:28:14.550 --> 04:28:14.560 align:start position:0%

04:28:31.870 --> 04:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
question from representative Stringham
 
04:28:34.830 --> 04:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
and um about what is our oversight what
 
04:28:37.269 --> 04:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
are we doing how are we looking at
 
04:28:41.710 --> 04:28:41.720 align:start position:0%

04:29:23.349 --> 04:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
supports um we have the outpatient
 
04:29:26.189 --> 04:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
treatment we have the doorways uh I want
 
04:29:28.269 --> 04:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit we did not do a
 
04:29:31.030 --> 04:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
slide and it was um I noted it this
 
04:29:34.109 --> 04:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
morning about the opioid abatement
 
04:29:36.389 --> 04:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
programs so in addition to the
 
04:29:38.469 --> 04:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
governor's commission there is now an
 
04:29:42.469 --> 04:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement um trust fund
 
04:29:45.269 --> 04:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
commission and that was established when
 
04:29:48.429 --> 04:29:48.439 align:start position:0%
we started getting settlement money um
 
04:29:51.309 --> 04:29:51.319 align:start position:0%
with the lawsuits against the
 
04:29:53.990 --> 04:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and the pharmaceutical
 
04:29:57.550 --> 04:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
companies um that contributed to the
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
opioid um epidemic and um You probably
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
have seen headlines where you know
 
04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars of settlements and
 
04:30:09.149 --> 04:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
so we established the state established
 
04:30:12.750 --> 04:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
a trust fund and there is a commission
 
04:30:16.229 --> 04:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
um that was legislatively created uh to
 
04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
be able to oversee those funds and to
 
04:30:23.950 --> 04:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
make allocations of those funds and so
 
04:30:26.349 --> 04:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
they've been up and running they also
 
04:30:28.189 --> 04:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
have a dashboard similar to the
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
governor's commission dashboard that um
 
04:30:35.309 --> 04:30:35.319 align:start position:0%
is available um we they make funding
 
04:30:38.349 --> 04:30:38.359 align:start position:0%
decisions um and have made significant
 
04:30:41.229 --> 04:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
investments in housing is one area that
 
04:30:44.429 --> 04:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
they uh we're looking at um they've also
 
04:30:48.149 --> 04:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
made smaller Community uh investments in
 
04:30:51.030 --> 04:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
different programs perhaps some have
 
04:30:55.229 --> 04:30:55.239 align:start position:0%
been mobile Vans um one has been to help
 
04:30:58.510 --> 04:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
with a purchase of um uh a piece of
 
04:31:01.269 --> 04:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
property for um
 
04:31:04.229 --> 04:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
Services uh so they have different ways
 
04:31:07.429 --> 04:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
of being able to allocate those funds it
 
04:31:07.439 --> 04:31:10.030 align:start position:0%
of being able to allocate those funds it
is

04:31:10.030 --> 04:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:31:13.389 --> 04:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
um not in our budget
 
04:31:16.590 --> 04:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
and um Nathan can explain
 
04:31:19.469 --> 04:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
that sure it uh the the the opioid
 
04:31:21.109 --> 04:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
abatement trust fund it's a dedicated
 
04:31:22.830 --> 04:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
non-lps and continually appropriated
 
04:31:25.630 --> 04:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
fund and and that commission uh directs
 
04:31:29.269 --> 04:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
the department um to utilize that money
 
04:31:32.269 --> 04:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
and and they they meet regular regularly
 
04:31:35.429 --> 04:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
and um the department does not indiv
 
04:31:37.510 --> 04:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
individually make decisions on how those
 
04:31:39.950 --> 04:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
funds are used that's that's part of the
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
under statute that's that's how that's
 
04:31:46.389 --> 04:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
decided representative tarki for a
 
04:31:49.710 --> 04:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
question this maybe isn't even relevant
 
04:31:52.229 --> 04:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
our division however in the draft of hb2
 
04:31:54.109 --> 04:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
there's money from the opio basement
 
04:31:55.870 --> 04:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
abatement trust fund that's being
 
04:31:57.950 --> 04:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
directed towards law enforcement at the
 
04:32:01.389 --> 04:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
northern border um can you I know this
 
04:32:03.670 --> 04:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
is not your wheelhouse but maybe talk
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
about those funds and um how they can be
 
04:32:10.389 --> 04:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
used and if I think in the past um
 
04:32:12.070 --> 04:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
discussion of using them for law enforce
 
04:32:14.910 --> 04:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
ment was not a very popular
 
04:32:17.630 --> 04:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
idea uh we can't comment on that just
 
04:32:19.590 --> 04:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
because it is out of our wheelhouse I
 
04:32:23.389 --> 04:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
can say that the purpose um the use of
 
04:32:26.070 --> 04:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
the funds is dictated by Statute and by
 
04:32:26.080 --> 04:32:27.349 align:start position:0%
the funds is dictated by Statute and by
administrative

04:32:27.349 --> 04:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
04:32:30.590 --> 04:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
role okay thank
 
04:32:35.630 --> 04:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
you representative n valeno Nano we'll
 
04:32:39.550 --> 04:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
get it the um uh question I have what's
 
04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
the U Is that a one-off
 
04:32:44.229 --> 04:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh fund I mean the money in that fund
 
04:32:46.349 --> 04:32:46.359 align:start position:0%
was created by a one-off settlement or
 
04:32:49.429 --> 04:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
it's a continuing funding source and
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
then the other question is um same kind
 
04:32:55.590 --> 04:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
of a question we had on the uh
 
04:32:59.710 --> 04:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
Governor's uh uh commission fund uh what
 
04:33:02.590 --> 04:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
is the B roughly the balance in that and
 
04:33:05.230 --> 04:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
you know what kind of uh budgeting do
 
04:33:07.269 --> 04:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
you do against you know you know you
 
04:33:09.629 --> 04:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
like to hold a reserve or what what's
 
04:33:13.789 --> 04:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
the financial picture on that fund sure
 
04:33:16.910 --> 04:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
so um we receive uh settlement funds in
 
04:33:19.230 --> 04:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
different ways depending on the lawsuit
 
04:33:22.750 --> 04:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
and the success of um how New Hampshire
 
04:33:25.230 --> 04:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
participated in that lawsuit through our
 
04:33:28.029 --> 04:33:28.039 align:start position:0%
department of justice and so we've
 
04:33:30.109 --> 04:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
received one-time funds of you know
 
04:33:33.390 --> 04:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
small amounts and we've received
 
04:33:37.109 --> 04:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
multi-year multi-million dollar Awards
 
04:33:40.869 --> 04:33:40.879 align:start position:0%
so um from the from the settlement so we
 
04:33:44.470 --> 04:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
have Awards that are expected to be um
 
04:33:48.310 --> 04:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
made for up to 18 years or 10 years it
 
04:33:50.949 --> 04:33:50.959 align:start position:0%
depends on the nature of the settlement
 
04:33:56.629 --> 04:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
and so um it we can project um when
 
04:33:59.429 --> 04:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to receive funds based on an
 
04:34:02.830 --> 04:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
actual settlement and what New Hampshire
 
04:34:05.629 --> 04:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
has been allocated there are still
 
04:34:09.189 --> 04:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
pending lawsuits and um we expect that
 
04:34:12.230 --> 04:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
that will continue for a period of time
 
04:34:15.629 --> 04:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
and um we're fortunate that the um
 
04:34:17.310 --> 04:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner of the Department of
 
04:34:20.510 --> 04:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
Justice is now the chair of the opio de
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
batement commission and he's able to
 
04:34:24.551 --> 04:34:24.561 align:start position:0%
give us um updates at each of the
 
04:34:28.990 --> 04:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
monthly meetings the commission is much
 
04:34:32.590 --> 04:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
newer than the governor's commission and
 
04:34:36.910 --> 04:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
um the amount of funds I believe um we
 
04:34:40.150 --> 04:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
have received somewhere around $50
 
04:34:43.070 --> 04:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
million and the current balance is
 
04:34:46.990 --> 04:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
roughly that has not been allocated um
 
04:34:50.789 --> 04:34:50.799 align:start position:0%
and um it excludes um it already I'm
 
04:34:54.429 --> 04:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
accounting for this is that the amount
 
04:34:56.949 --> 04:34:56.959 align:start position:0%
in the budget so if you take all of that
 
04:34:59.429 --> 04:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
and you look at what's unallocated and
 
04:35:03.269 --> 04:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
decisions to be made on is about $1
 
04:35:07.150 --> 04:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
million is the balance okay thank
 
04:35:11.269 --> 04:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
you all said on this subject all right
 
04:35:11.279 --> 04:35:12.949 align:start position:0%
you all said on this subject all right
proceed

04:35:12.949 --> 04:35:12.959 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
04:35:14.470 --> 04:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not quite sure where I should
 
04:35:17.910 --> 04:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
go next um but I think we were talking
 
04:35:21.029 --> 04:35:21.039 align:start position:0%
about um getting up to Residential
 
04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
Treatment um and housing supports so we
 
04:35:27.390 --> 04:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
have different
 
04:35:30.750 --> 04:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
allocations um and in support for
 
04:35:34.789 --> 04:35:34.799 align:start position:0%
particular programs that have to do with
 
04:35:38.709 --> 04:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
um Alcohol and Other Drugs um I should
 
04:35:40.869 --> 04:35:40.879 align:start position:0%
go back what I want to tell you that the
 
04:35:42.830 --> 04:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
doorways when I talked about that
 
04:35:45.189 --> 04:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
categorical funding and that's specific
 
04:35:47.709 --> 04:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
for people with opioid use disorder we
 
04:35:52.150 --> 04:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
found and we know from the um data that
 
04:35:55.150 --> 04:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
individuals the the most used um or
 
04:35:59.109 --> 04:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
misused drug in New Hampshire is alcohol
 
04:36:00.949 --> 04:36:00.959 align:start position:0%
and so we had people who are appearing
 
04:36:04.869 --> 04:36:04.879 align:start position:0%
at doorways that were 100% State opioid
 
04:36:08.551 --> 04:36:08.561 align:start position:0%
response Grant funded and didn't have
 
04:36:10.269 --> 04:36:10.279 align:start position:0%
the funds to help support those
 
04:36:13.189 --> 04:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
individuals who only had alcohol use
 
04:36:16.830 --> 04:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
disorder and no history um of uh opioid
 
04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
use disorder so the governor's
 
04:36:21.029 --> 04:36:21.039 align:start position:0%
commission some of their funding helped
 
04:36:24.029 --> 04:36:24.039 align:start position:0%
support the doorways for those
 
04:36:28.990 --> 04:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
non sore funded um allowable expenses so
 
04:36:31.109 --> 04:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to mention that as a way
 
04:36:34.510 --> 04:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
that we're really crosswalking how we
 
04:36:37.750 --> 04:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
breed funding and pull together the
 
04:36:39.910 --> 04:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
pieces so that we don't have those gaps
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
for People based on our funding
 
04:36:47.150 --> 04:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
source we help support our treatment
 
04:36:49.830 --> 04:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
programs we talk about um the
 
04:36:52.269 --> 04:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
residential treatment inpatient
 
04:36:55.830 --> 04:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
treatment um we help with room and board
 
04:36:58.470 --> 04:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid doesn't pay for room and board
 
04:37:00.789 --> 04:37:00.799 align:start position:0%
um when someone enters a course of
 
04:37:03.910 --> 04:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
treatment in a residential setting so
 
04:37:06.830 --> 04:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
the state opid response um dollars are
 
04:37:09.551 --> 04:37:09.561 align:start position:0%
able to um go towards that room and
 
04:37:09.561 --> 04:37:11.789 align:start position:0%
able to um go towards that room and
board

04:37:11.789 --> 04:37:11.799 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:37:15.709 --> 04:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
um uh we mentioned um there is that
 
04:37:17.750 --> 04:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
crisis respit when someone's ready to
 
04:37:19.709 --> 04:37:19.719 align:start position:0%
enter into treatment but doesn't yet
 
04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
have an admission or is a waiting
 
04:37:24.390 --> 04:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
admission so we have those beds
 
04:37:27.910 --> 04:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
available um we help support the access
 
04:37:30.750 --> 04:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
point um again that's for people
 
04:37:33.150 --> 04:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
experiencing a substance use crisis as
 
04:37:36.310 --> 04:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
well as a mental health crisis or um a
 
04:37:38.150 --> 04:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
04:37:42.230 --> 04:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
crisis and um as noted we carry out not
 
04:37:44.830 --> 04:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
only the administrative functions of the
 
04:37:46.869 --> 04:37:46.879 align:start position:0%
governor's commission but also of the
 
04:37:52.109 --> 04:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:55.670 --> 04:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
commission we went um a little rogue um
 
04:37:58.429 --> 04:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
on page 52 and don't have a wheel we
 
04:37:59.789 --> 04:37:59.799 align:start position:0%
just have a
 
04:38:02.949 --> 04:38:02.959 align:start position:0%
fan um to go through the same the same
 
04:38:05.830 --> 04:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
steps as we look at um prevention
 
04:38:12.349 --> 04:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:13.949 --> 04:38:13.959 align:start position:0%
on page
 
04:38:17.949 --> 04:38:17.959 align:start position:0%
53 this is um just some examples of the
 
04:38:21.150 --> 04:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
types of services that fall into those
 
04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
categories so we have as I mentioned the
 
04:38:26.070 --> 04:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
regional public health networks and you
 
04:38:28.949 --> 04:38:28.959 align:start position:0%
can see the regions there's one in your
 
04:38:32.269 --> 04:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
region um I'm sure you can recognize it
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
um and we talk about how many people
 
04:38:38.830 --> 04:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
were um the partners they convene those
 
04:38:40.830 --> 04:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and those Community Based
 
04:38:43.830 --> 04:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
organizations and you can see um those
 
04:38:46.551 --> 04:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
convenings um I will note that the
 
04:38:49.230 --> 04:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
business Community is part of this um
 
04:38:51.551 --> 04:38:51.561 align:start position:0%
and an important aspect especially when
 
04:38:55.269 --> 04:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
we look at recovery friendly
 
04:38:59.551 --> 04:38:59.561 align:start position:0%
workplaces and the number of uh New
 
04:39:01.150 --> 04:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents served the
 
04:39:04.750 --> 04:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
educational trainings and um the the
 
04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:14.070 --> 04:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
54 so this is looking at um Community
 
04:39:18.000 --> 04:39:19.109 align:start position:0%
54 so this is looking at um Community
Based

04:39:19.109 --> 04:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
Based
 
04:39:21.349 --> 04:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
prevention we know how important
 
04:39:24.670 --> 04:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
prevention is especially in this Arena
 
04:39:26.670 --> 04:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
and um so that's why you see a lot of
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
focus a few years ago the governor's
 
04:39:31.269 --> 04:39:31.279 align:start position:0%
commission recognized that prevention
 
04:39:34.109 --> 04:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
was lagging behind um everyone
 
04:39:35.869 --> 04:39:35.879 align:start position:0%
responding to treatment and so they
 
04:39:38.948 --> 04:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to invest dollars um in
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
prevention efforts and actually had um a
 
04:39:45.150 --> 04:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
very uh specific funding strategy around
 
04:39:47.390 --> 04:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
Prevention Services so some of that
 
04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:59.628 --> 04:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:03.550 --> 04:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
55 so we have um representative Neno for
 
04:40:06.510 --> 04:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
a question sorry to sorry to be a
 
04:40:08.550 --> 04:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
nuisance here but just a quick question
 
04:40:10.150 --> 04:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
on of the eight
 
04:40:14.628 --> 04:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
programs uh um um I I assume that you
 
04:40:15.948 --> 04:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
couldn't just take eight and divide it
 
04:40:16.910 --> 04:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
into the
 
04:40:21.948 --> 04:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
22,000 but so uh what would be the top
 
04:40:24.670 --> 04:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
couple of programs that account for more
 
04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
of the individuals and and where what
 
04:40:28.628 --> 04:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
areas do they
 
04:40:31.550 --> 04:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
serve so I unless someone behind me
 
04:40:33.628 --> 04:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
stands up um I'll have to get back to
 
04:40:36.910 --> 04:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
you on that okay because I assume it's
 
04:40:39.910 --> 04:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's regional or yes yeah those eight
 
04:40:45.310 --> 04:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:48.830 --> 04:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
you I have had staff here to support me
 
04:40:50.550 --> 04:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
um which has been amazing that they're
 
04:40:52.750 --> 04:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
sitting here and having to listen and
 
04:40:54.350 --> 04:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
probably saying ooh o you should have
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
said this um but it is school vacation
 
04:41:00.550 --> 04:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
week so we've had um some absences um
 
04:41:03.670 --> 04:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
and our um our Bureau of drug and
 
04:41:05.628 --> 04:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
alcohol Services bureau chief was here
 
04:41:07.430 --> 04:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
earlier I don't believe she's here now
 
04:41:10.350 --> 04:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
but um she is a prevention Queen and I'm
 
04:41:11.830 --> 04:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
sure she can answer
 
04:41:13.590 --> 04:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
um those questions off the top of her
 
04:41:15.830 --> 04:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
head is somebody
 
04:41:20.948 --> 04:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:24.310 --> 04:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
okay all right 55 again school-based
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
prevention these are school districts
 
04:41:30.708 --> 04:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
that have um voluntarily and eagerly
 
04:41:34.030 --> 04:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
adopted programs um to address um
 
04:41:37.110 --> 04:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
substance misuse student assistant
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
programs um are coordinators that are at
 
04:41:43.670 --> 04:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
middle and high schools across the state
 
04:41:47.230 --> 04:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
um and they're supported um there's um
 
04:41:49.390 --> 04:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
health and evidence-based curriculum
 
04:41:52.628 --> 04:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
that is supported multi-tier systems of
 
04:41:56.070 --> 04:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
support and we have um the Collegiate
 
04:41:59.510 --> 04:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
tertiary prevention that was an area of
 
04:42:02.030 --> 04:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
particular interest that we heard over
 
04:42:05.190 --> 04:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
and over that we were um focusing on
 
04:42:07.470 --> 04:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
middle and high schools but we're
 
04:42:09.750 --> 04:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
finding that college Aid students was
 
04:42:11.990 --> 04:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
that was their first experience
 
04:42:14.110 --> 04:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
um was substance misuse and that we
 
04:42:17.270 --> 04:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
needed to um put some support in there
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
so that's what that's
 
04:42:22.070 --> 04:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
about representative priest for a
 
04:42:26.190 --> 04:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
question again as a clarification um the
 
04:42:29.390 --> 04:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
school-based prevention not only covers
 
04:42:32.150 --> 04:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh Public Schools but also Collegiate
 
04:42:35.350 --> 04:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire right yes okay
 
04:42:35.360 --> 04:42:39.590 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire right yes okay
thank

04:42:39.590 --> 04:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:42.190 --> 04:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
you and a quick question question on the
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
Collegiate tertiary prevention that's in
 
04:42:47.070 --> 04:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
conjunction with so again how's that
 
04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
structured and you know who does that uh
 
04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
does it touch University of New
 
04:42:54.190 --> 04:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or or
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
yeah it right now it's UNH based um with
 
04:43:02.628 --> 04:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
um the um plan to expand to other
 
04:43:04.948 --> 04:43:04.958 align:start position:0%
university system uh
 
04:43:08.788 --> 04:43:08.798 align:start position:0%
campuses um so yeah so so it's a pilot
 
04:43:10.830 --> 04:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
program at this point essentially yeah I
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
would say it's pilot with the um plan to
 
04:43:15.990 --> 04:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
scale up we do plan to scale
 
04:43:21.948 --> 04:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:25.150 --> 04:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
you representative priest for question
 
04:43:27.868 --> 04:43:27.878 align:start position:0%
yes uh going back to
 
04:43:35.708 --> 04:43:35.718 align:start position:0%
um the numbers for um alcohol alcoholism
 
04:43:40.510 --> 04:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
and Other Drug um abuse programs um do
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
we have any
 
04:43:45.670 --> 04:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
numbers of what the population is out
 
04:43:47.830 --> 04:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
there and what
 
04:43:51.910 --> 04:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
percentage have seek help from
 
04:43:54.628 --> 04:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
you so I think there are two different
 
04:43:56.708 --> 04:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
ways of looking at there's the
 
04:43:58.910 --> 04:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of individuals who've been
 
04:44:02.110 --> 04:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
served um it depends on how you look at
 
04:44:05.708 --> 04:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
being served is it um in a treatment
 
04:44:09.350 --> 04:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
program is it through recovery housing
 
04:44:11.830 --> 04:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
through um whatever
 
04:44:14.190 --> 04:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
so there's one that's one way to look at
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
it and to slice and dice it I think also
 
04:44:19.990 --> 04:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
there are the statistics that have been
 
04:44:23.390 --> 04:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
done based on Anonymous surveys about
 
04:44:26.310 --> 04:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
how many people actually have alcohol
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
use disorder or opioid use disorder in
 
04:44:31.670 --> 04:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
the state and um those are very
 
04:44:33.788 --> 04:44:33.798 align:start position:0%
different numbers because not everybody
 
04:44:38.430 --> 04:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
who has a disorder needs or wants um
 
04:44:40.590 --> 04:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
some type of service that is funded by
 
04:44:42.470 --> 04:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
and are those numbers available for us
 
04:44:48.628 --> 04:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
to look at I believe they are um through
 
04:44:51.430 --> 04:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
our Public Health Partners we have some
 
04:44:54.590 --> 04:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
um statistics on that and be happy to um
 
04:44:57.030 --> 04:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
share the link to the website that has
 
04:45:00.110 --> 04:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
data that you can um that you can uh
 
04:45:02.310 --> 04:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
look through yourself that would be very
 
04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
useful thank you you're welcome just a
 
04:45:06.910 --> 04:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up question on that that
 
04:45:09.110 --> 04:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
occurred to me so do we partner with I
 
04:45:11.150 --> 04:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
mean the traditional organization that I
 
04:45:12.990 --> 04:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
you know kind of grew up with was
 
04:45:16.230 --> 04:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
Alcoholics Anonymous do we partner with
 
04:45:19.670 --> 04:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
them or do we fund them or or how to you
 
04:45:23.670 --> 04:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
know what's the relationship there so um
 
04:45:27.350 --> 04:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
I we do not fund specifically AA
 
04:45:30.708 --> 04:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
programs there are AA programs that are
 
04:45:34.110 --> 04:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
available to people through all of um
 
04:45:36.708 --> 04:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
throughout our whole system um but I
 
04:45:39.110 --> 04:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
think the very nature of that particular
 
04:45:44.708 --> 04:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
program is um the community based um and
 
04:45:48.628 --> 04:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how to describe it um
 
04:45:51.670 --> 04:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
but there's no there's no funding
 
04:45:53.910 --> 04:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
involved um if someone wants to
 
04:45:57.070 --> 04:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
participate I think that there um is
 
04:45:59.350 --> 04:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
community support through churches for
 
04:46:01.990 --> 04:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
locations and through um all the
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
different uh um public facilities and
 
04:46:08.910 --> 04:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
other organizations that host them um
 
04:46:12.350 --> 04:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
but we don't specifically fund AA
 
04:46:14.350 --> 04:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
programs that's kind of curious because
 
04:46:17.070 --> 04:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
I've always u u you know the feedback or
 
04:46:18.510 --> 04:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
anything you've seen on that there's
 
04:46:23.110 --> 04:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
very effective uh uh program and um you
 
04:46:24.390 --> 04:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
know it just seems strange that we
 
04:46:27.190 --> 04:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't somehow cooperate with or fund
 
04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
them other than you know indirectly
 
04:46:31.510 --> 04:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
through Community groups but anyhow it's
 
04:46:33.910 --> 04:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
just a side comment many many people
 
04:46:37.110 --> 04:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
find recovery through such programs and
 
04:46:40.390 --> 04:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
through other avenues so it is part of
 
04:46:44.990 --> 04:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
um the the um the the ecosystem and how
 
04:46:46.868 --> 04:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
people um receive the help that they
 
04:46:48.670 --> 04:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
need and and that they're able to find
 
04:46:50.430 --> 04:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
recovery through those
 
04:46:54.670 --> 04:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:56.948 --> 04:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
you all right we're getting down to the
 
04:46:56.958 --> 04:46:58.868 align:start position:0%
you all right we're getting down to the
wire

04:46:58.868 --> 04:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
wire
 
04:47:03.990 --> 04:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
here um so page
 
04:47:06.670 --> 04:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
56 this is overdose prevention we've
 
04:47:11.390 --> 04:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
already talked about um the uh the lock
 
04:47:11.400 --> 04:47:12.350 align:start position:0%
already talked about um the uh the lock
Zone

04:47:12.350 --> 04:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
Zone
 
04:47:15.670 --> 04:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
distribution and you have the drug desk
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
by year we didn't add 2024 because the
 
04:47:19.948 --> 04:47:19.958 align:start position:0%
numbers weren't finalized when we did
 
04:47:23.390 --> 04:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
this but they continued to go down um
 
04:47:26.030 --> 04:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
year overy year um we did see the
 
04:47:29.910 --> 04:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
increase in in 2022 but then we've seen
 
04:47:33.150 --> 04:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
um pretty remarkable drops since that
 
04:47:37.030 --> 04:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
time uh we um have attributed that to
 
04:47:39.708 --> 04:47:39.718 align:start position:0%
all of the programs that are in place
 
04:47:43.990 --> 04:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
most notably the distribution of nxone
 
04:47:46.990 --> 04:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
so that we are preventing deaths um when
 
04:47:50.910 --> 04:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
there is an overdose and access to the
 
04:47:54.390 --> 04:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
medication for addiction treatment so
 
04:47:57.590 --> 04:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
that um has been uh an a couple areas
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
that have been highlighted as
 
04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
contributing significantly to that
 
04:48:04.270 --> 04:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
reduction in the overdose
 
04:48:06.948 --> 04:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
des and just an observation but we've
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
heard a lot and we see a lot about the
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and and and Fentanyl deaths so
 
04:48:16.190 --> 04:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm kind of surprised to see
 
04:48:19.230 --> 04:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
that the statistics I I don't know
 
04:48:20.830 --> 04:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
that's worked into the STA the
 
04:48:23.670 --> 04:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
statistics I presume so uh that seems
 
04:48:25.708 --> 04:48:25.718 align:start position:0%
like a disconnect from you know all the
 
04:48:27.670 --> 04:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
reports that you hear about the
 
04:48:30.830 --> 04:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
fentanyl uh crisis and how deadly that
 
04:48:33.750 --> 04:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
is and I don't think the uh no oxone
 
04:48:35.830 --> 04:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't work on fentol does it it
 
04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely does oh it does okay there
 
04:48:41.670 --> 04:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
are other um so it doesn't work for all
 
04:48:45.750 --> 04:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
drugs um that um may cause an overdose
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
um but with fentanyl it is effective um
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
we just had uh the governor's commission
 
04:48:52.150 --> 04:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
just had a meeting on Friday and we had
 
04:48:55.270 --> 04:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
a report from the um Department of
 
04:48:59.110 --> 04:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
Safety and they shared um with us their
 
04:49:02.548 --> 04:49:02.558 align:start position:0%
state lab um so they have all of the
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
details about um the samples that they
 
04:49:09.510 --> 04:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
were given to test and what was found in
 
04:49:12.070 --> 04:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
those samples so was there meth was
 
04:49:15.708 --> 04:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
there cocaine was there um you know and
 
04:49:18.430 --> 04:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
you name the drug and the combination
 
04:49:22.350 --> 04:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
thereof it's a great report um and so
 
04:49:25.070 --> 04:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
they they did that can get that to you
 
04:49:28.310 --> 04:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
point you to their uh website and they
 
04:49:31.590 --> 04:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
also um provide a monthly drug
 
04:49:34.910 --> 04:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring initiative report which takes
 
04:49:37.670 --> 04:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
information from a variety of sources
 
04:49:40.110 --> 04:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
and they get it from EMS so the
 
04:49:42.150 --> 04:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide EMS system they're able to
 
04:49:46.510 --> 04:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
pull data from and they know how many uh
 
04:49:49.510 --> 04:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
across the state how many um responses
 
04:49:53.150 --> 04:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
there were to individuals who had
 
04:49:58.230 --> 04:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
overdosed um and um the and then you
 
04:50:00.350 --> 04:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
take the state lab information that's
 
04:50:02.708 --> 04:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
included in that report you take the
 
04:50:04.430 --> 04:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
treatment admissions that are in that
 
04:50:07.110 --> 04:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
report so it's a wealth of information
 
04:50:09.150 --> 04:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
that is provided about the current
 
04:50:11.990 --> 04:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
status of what's Happening happening um
 
04:50:13.868 --> 04:50:13.878 align:start position:0%
and what we're always looking at and the
 
04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
state police um and the and the
 
04:50:18.868 --> 04:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
department of safety really talked about
 
04:50:21.070 --> 04:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
um what they're seeing on the street and
 
04:50:23.628 --> 04:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
what's up and coming and uh the concerns
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
that may arise um as they different
 
04:50:30.628 --> 04:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
combinations of drugs that are um out
 
04:50:33.628 --> 04:50:33.638 align:start position:0%
and put into distribution and are of
 
04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
great concern so we partner really
 
04:50:37.910 --> 04:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
closely with the Department of
 
04:50:39.948 --> 04:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
Safety I I guess the other one is
 
04:50:41.868 --> 04:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
probably a Mis conception on my part is
 
04:50:43.350 --> 04:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
just that and there's been a lot of
 
04:50:45.548 --> 04:50:45.558 align:start position:0%
discussion in This this term about
 
04:50:48.830 --> 04:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana and medical marijuana or you
 
04:50:51.310 --> 04:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
know legalizing marijuana and maybe it's
 
04:50:53.548 --> 04:50:53.558 align:start position:0%
a misconception on my part but I was you
 
04:50:54.910 --> 04:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
know my understanding was that the
 
04:50:57.830 --> 04:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana isn't the same marijuana that
 
04:51:00.708 --> 04:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
I may have uh experienced when I was
 
04:51:03.548 --> 04:51:03.558 align:start position:0%
College age and that it's uh sometimes
 
04:51:06.990 --> 04:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
laced with a lot of other stuff so is
 
04:51:10.750 --> 04:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
that is that uh a misconception or is it
 
04:51:13.628 --> 04:51:13.638 align:start position:0%
uh uh some aspects of marijuana use that
 
04:51:18.390 --> 04:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
overlap with the uh whole uh mixture of
 
04:51:20.590 --> 04:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
other things that are out there yeah and
 
04:51:22.948 --> 04:51:22.958 align:start position:0%
the um and the people from the state lab
 
04:51:25.070 --> 04:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
did present some of that data what they
 
04:51:27.510 --> 04:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
indicated was when you look at it
 
04:51:30.030 --> 04:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
because it's no longer a criminal
 
04:51:32.990 --> 04:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
penalty um for
 
04:51:36.190 --> 04:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
um marijuana or for cannabis that
 
04:51:38.510 --> 04:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
they're not testing as often for that
 
04:51:41.990 --> 04:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
but it does come up in that um poly use
 
04:51:46.270 --> 04:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
of um of different drugs and and Lace um
 
04:51:49.390 --> 04:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
but um I'm not I'm not the expert on
 
04:51:51.708 --> 04:51:51.718 align:start position:0%
that particular I understand thank you
 
04:51:54.628 --> 04:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
yeah um going off of that there hasn't
 
04:51:56.590 --> 04:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
been a whole lot of talk about smoking
 
04:51:59.270 --> 04:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
in general uh in your department whereas
 
04:52:01.390 --> 04:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
we've reached all other sorts of topics
 
04:52:06.030 --> 04:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:10.548 --> 04:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
that um so that is um something that we
 
04:52:15.510 --> 04:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
we have um had efforts around um I would
 
04:52:18.628 --> 04:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
defer to associate commissioner um Trish
 
04:52:21.190 --> 04:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
Tilly who is here um from a public
 
04:52:23.310 --> 04:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
health perspective where there are
 
04:52:26.830 --> 04:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
programs around that we also have had um
 
04:52:29.070 --> 04:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
efforts around our community mental
 
04:52:32.310 --> 04:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
health system because individuals with
 
04:52:36.590 --> 04:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh mental health condition have um been
 
04:52:40.868 --> 04:52:40.878 align:start position:0%
known to have an increase uh risk and
 
04:52:43.750 --> 04:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
associated with smoking um and with
 
04:52:47.230 --> 04:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
tobacco um but um if if Trish is here
 
04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
and she wants to comment but um it is
 
04:52:51.948 --> 04:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
something that um is certainly on the
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
radar sure miss Tilly if You' just like
 
04:52:56.750 --> 04:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
to have a seat hi again and thank you
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
Patricia Tilly associate commissioner um
 
04:53:00.190 --> 04:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
at the department thanks for that
 
04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
question I think we can dive into that a
 
04:53:04.670 --> 04:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
lot more on Tuesday when public health
 
04:53:07.788 --> 04:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
comes and talks to the committee our
 
04:53:09.590 --> 04:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
tobacco prevention and control program
 
04:53:11.708 --> 04:53:11.718 align:start position:0%
who in the division of Public Health
 
04:53:13.948 --> 04:53:13.958 align:start position:0%
Services we've had a long partnership
 
04:53:15.628 --> 04:53:15.638 align:start position:0%
with the division for Behavioral Health
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
as as director Fox had noted because of
 
04:53:20.868 --> 04:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
the disproportionality of people with
 
04:53:22.548 --> 04:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
mental health or behavioral health
 
04:53:24.788 --> 04:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
conditions and tobacco use and so we
 
04:53:27.230 --> 04:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
have strategies to be able to connect
 
04:53:30.310 --> 04:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
that both um in Quitline Services as
 
04:53:32.430 --> 04:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
well as just sort of the structural
 
04:53:35.110 --> 04:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
environmental around having appropriate
 
04:53:39.310 --> 04:53:39.320 align:start position:0%
tobacco related policies in um among the
 
04:53:41.070 --> 04:53:41.080 align:start position:0%
different programs that that serve
 
04:53:42.708 --> 04:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
people with behavioral health conditions
 
04:53:44.910 --> 04:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
so it sort of comes out from both ways
 
04:53:47.190 --> 04:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
the issue of course um many people have
 
04:53:49.788 --> 04:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
been thinking about is vaping um so our
 
04:53:52.350 --> 04:53:52.360 align:start position:0%
tobacco program also covers vaping in
 
04:53:54.670 --> 04:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
particular for adolescent use and we saw
 
04:53:57.390 --> 04:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
that dramatic rise of vaping during the
 
04:53:59.708 --> 04:53:59.718 align:start position:0%
pandemic we're happy to see that the
 
04:54:02.430 --> 04:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
youth rate of vaping has come down it's
 
04:54:04.868 --> 04:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
still too high but we did have a peak in
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
about 2021 and we're on the other side
 
04:54:09.190 --> 04:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
of that now but there are lots of
 
04:54:12.670 --> 04:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
unknown questions about the impact of of
 
04:54:15.750 --> 04:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
vaping those chemicals the nicotine use
 
04:54:17.708 --> 04:54:17.718 align:start position:0%
and what that might mean for um
 
04:54:19.750 --> 04:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
addiction later on so more to come on
 
04:54:21.270 --> 04:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
Tuesday thank you we'll look forward to
 
04:54:22.948 --> 04:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
that on Tuesday budget work session
 
04:54:24.788 --> 04:54:24.798 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health representative
 
04:54:28.788 --> 04:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
tersi for a question thank you
 
04:54:33.150 --> 04:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
um we've it's my understanding that the
 
04:54:35.430 --> 04:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
um progress we've made with overdose
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
prevention can be tied to Granite
 
04:54:41.830 --> 04:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
Advantage um and the Medicaid supports
 
04:54:43.350 --> 04:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
that we have for people with substance
 
04:54:45.628 --> 04:54:45.638 align:start position:0%
use disorder um because we've seen the
 
04:54:49.270 --> 04:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
numbers drop um as your chart indicates
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
right here and I guess my question goes
 
04:54:55.230 --> 04:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
to you mentioned um it it it points to
 
04:54:57.830 --> 04:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
Noone access but also medications for
 
04:55:01.430 --> 04:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
treatment so I guess the conversation
 
04:55:05.868 --> 04:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
again on the um Medicade changes to both
 
04:55:09.150 --> 04:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
the prescription copays doubling um and
 
04:55:11.830 --> 04:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
just simple access to the Medicaid
 
04:55:15.150 --> 04:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
Program um raises some alarm for me that
 
04:55:17.470 --> 04:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
we may have a setback can we talk a
 
04:55:21.190 --> 04:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
little bit about how someone who um
 
04:55:23.948 --> 04:55:23.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't have coverage or can't afford uh
 
04:55:26.070 --> 04:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
their pharmaceutical copay would be able
 
04:55:28.110 --> 04:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
to access medication for their treatment
 
04:55:31.948 --> 04:55:31.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:34.110 --> 04:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
disorder and how that may affect the
 
04:55:34.120 --> 04:55:35.270 align:start position:0%
disorder and how that may affect the
overall

04:55:35.270 --> 04:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
overall
 
04:55:39.030 --> 04:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
picture so um when I talked about where
 
04:55:42.390 --> 04:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
in actually this ties into the um slide
 
04:55:44.150 --> 04:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
that we're about to go to when talking
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
about treatment so the department does
 
04:55:52.548 --> 04:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
contract with uh treatment providers and
 
04:55:56.510 --> 04:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
as part of that contract it covers non
 
04:55:59.830 --> 04:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
billable Medicaid billable services and
 
04:56:05.628 --> 04:56:05.638 align:start position:0%
so it ALS so there are um people from
 
04:56:09.270 --> 04:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
the um federal poverty line of 138 to
 
04:56:09.280 --> 04:56:10.788 align:start position:0%
the um federal poverty line of 138 to
400%

04:56:10.788 --> 04:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
400%
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
that are covered by these contracts as
 
04:56:16.948 --> 04:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
well th as those that are um uninsured
 
04:56:16.958 --> 04:56:18.190 align:start position:0%
well th as those that are um uninsured
and

04:56:18.190 --> 04:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
underinsured and so the providers are
 
04:56:24.788 --> 04:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
able to through demonstration of the
 
04:56:28.590 --> 04:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
need bill against those uh
 
04:56:33.670 --> 04:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
contracts um to be able to fill those
 
04:56:38.230 --> 04:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
gaps I am unsure of the impact that a
 
04:56:41.788 --> 04:56:41.798 align:start position:0%
change in expansion would have other
 
04:56:44.670 --> 04:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
than when we first had these contracts
 
04:56:50.430 --> 04:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
there was not um a benefit um for um sud
 
04:56:54.350 --> 04:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
Services through Medicaid until um the
 
04:56:56.548 --> 04:56:56.558 align:start position:0%
ACA was passed in
 
04:57:00.750 --> 04:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
2014 and be so before we paid a um
 
04:57:02.590 --> 04:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
almost all of the services were paid
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
through these contracts over time we
 
04:57:06.990 --> 04:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
were able to shift what we were paying
 
04:57:09.310 --> 04:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
for for these treatment providers
 
04:57:12.430 --> 04:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
because of the Medicaid coverage um
 
04:57:14.510 --> 04:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
people were covered and they were able
 
04:57:17.230 --> 04:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
to Bill Medicaid rather than bill
 
04:57:19.390 --> 04:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
against the contract so we saw a shift
 
04:57:21.948 --> 04:57:21.958 align:start position:0%
in the way um that we are paying for
 
04:57:21.958 --> 04:57:22.708 align:start position:0%
in the way um that we are paying for
those

04:57:22.708 --> 04:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:57:26.270 --> 04:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
Services um and we would expect that
 
04:57:29.670 --> 04:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
there may be a shift back so that's a
 
04:57:33.390 --> 04:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
tiny bit of um better news than what I
 
04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
thought but is there a ceiling on those
 
04:57:37.750 --> 04:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
contracts like is there a way those
 
04:57:41.390 --> 04:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
could get maxed out the ceiling is met
 
04:57:44.310 --> 04:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
today we we ask for the funds and they
 
04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
expend them so it is all dependent on um
 
04:57:58.430 --> 04:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:06.670 --> 04:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
57 you can see the numbers here the
 
04:58:09.390 --> 04:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
numbers that are served these are not
 
04:58:11.350 --> 04:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
every single treatment provider in the
 
04:58:12.868 --> 04:58:12.878 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire these are the
 
04:58:16.190 --> 04:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
ones that responded to a request for
 
04:58:19.030 --> 04:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
proposals and have entered into contract
 
04:58:22.110 --> 04:58:22.120 align:start position:0%
with the state um so those this wouldn't
 
04:58:25.628 --> 04:58:25.638 align:start position:0%
be reflective of all um providers in the
 
04:58:28.070 --> 04:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
state um there are some that don't
 
04:58:31.110 --> 04:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
accept um Medicaid and choose they may
 
04:58:33.110 --> 04:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
accept Medicaid but they choose not to
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
contract with the state representative
 
04:58:38.390 --> 04:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
Neno for a question yeah very quick
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
question is this this Behavior Health
 
04:58:43.390 --> 04:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
also cover gambling addiction I mean
 
04:58:45.948 --> 04:58:45.958 align:start position:0%
that's another I it's you know I just
 
04:58:48.190 --> 04:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
kind of struck me as being notable by
 
04:58:51.430 --> 04:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
its absence on this and then is there a
 
04:58:54.350 --> 04:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
separate uh are the casinos funding some
 
04:58:56.868 --> 04:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
kind of a separate fund for gambling
 
04:59:00.190 --> 04:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
addiction and what is what is that and
 
04:59:02.910 --> 04:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
what what's in it so I'm not sure if the
 
04:59:06.628 --> 04:59:06.638 align:start position:0%
LBA wants to comment on that
 
04:59:08.708 --> 04:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
um sorry I was in the midst of
 
04:59:10.510 --> 04:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
responding to an email what was the
 
04:59:13.070 --> 04:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
problem sorry about
 
04:59:16.390 --> 04:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
that I I can let you know so um he he
 
04:59:18.788 --> 04:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
was asking about um the gambling and
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
whether we um if there's an allocation
 
04:59:24.310 --> 04:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
through the state um to address um
 
04:59:26.670 --> 04:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
addiction to gambling and I know there
 
04:59:29.628 --> 04:59:29.638 align:start position:0%
is um it at one time I believe was going
 
04:59:31.470 --> 04:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
to be attached or was attached to the
 
04:59:34.788 --> 04:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
department but now it is overseen by the
 
04:59:37.750 --> 04:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission I believe okay um I'm
 
04:59:40.310 --> 04:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
not sure about that but I can check with
 
04:59:42.110 --> 04:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
um Mickey landrian who does division one
 
04:59:43.350 --> 04:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
so he would know about that through the
 
04:59:45.270 --> 04:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
lottery divis uh through the Lottery
 
04:59:46.548 --> 04:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
Commission so I can get you an answer to
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
that but it is a it is a behavioral
 
04:59:51.628 --> 04:59:51.638 align:start position:0%
health issue I mean for sure so I mean I
 
04:59:53.788 --> 04:59:53.798 align:start position:0%
would just as I said it was notable by
 
04:59:56.510 --> 04:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
its absence from anywhere any mention of
 
04:59:59.150 --> 04:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
it all in the in the presentation and
 
05:00:01.590 --> 05:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not you all are dealing with
 
05:00:03.990 --> 05:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
it with any programs or or that's a
 
05:00:08.910 --> 05:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
totally separate uh um there is funding
 
05:00:11.548 --> 05:00:11.558 align:start position:0%
um and it's does go I believe to the
 
05:00:14.548 --> 05:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission and it um funds
 
05:00:16.868 --> 05:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
programs for that addressing
 
05:00:20.030 --> 05:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
that I think it was the source of funds
 
05:00:24.150 --> 05:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
um that um really contributed it to
 
05:00:29.430 --> 05:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
being it um with um Lottery versus the
 
05:00:31.510 --> 05:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
department yeah but I mean that's been a
 
05:00:33.230 --> 05:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
that's been an expanding kind of a
 
05:00:35.510 --> 05:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
program was Lottery and then it went to
 
05:00:38.230 --> 05:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
you know the casinos and and my
 
05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the the the
 
05:00:42.190 --> 05:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed budget had money in
 
05:00:44.230 --> 05:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
there for slot machine a pretty big
 
05:00:48.510 --> 05:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
chunk of money in the uh in the budget
 
05:00:50.548 --> 05:00:50.558 align:start position:0%
uh towards the in the the end of the
 
05:00:53.708 --> 05:00:53.718 align:start position:0%
second year of the bium I think 127
 
05:00:55.868 --> 05:00:55.878 align:start position:0%
million that's exactly the estimate
 
05:00:59.030 --> 05:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
right that was the estimate that kind of
 
05:01:02.830 --> 05:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
U uh was used to balance the uh balance
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
the governor's
 
05:01:04.080 --> 05:01:05.868 align:start position:0%
the governor's
budget

05:01:05.868 --> 05:01:05.878 align:start position:0%
budget
 
05:01:08.310 --> 05:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
so right so I think that you'll get the
 
05:01:09.990 --> 05:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
information about where it is in the
 
05:01:12.030 --> 05:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
budget and what it funds and and how
 
05:01:14.310 --> 05:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's um what percentage and and that
 
05:01:15.868 --> 05:01:15.878 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
05:01:18.628 --> 05:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
thing but it is something that probably
 
05:01:20.350 --> 05:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
you have on the radar to be dealing with
 
05:01:24.708 --> 05:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
on the behavior health side
 
05:01:31.230 --> 05:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
yes proceed okay so we are closing in um
 
05:01:34.548 --> 05:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
the recovery we've talked about that a
 
05:01:36.470 --> 05:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
little bit we have the peer recovery
 
05:01:40.110 --> 05:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
support programs um and you can see how
 
05:01:43.350 --> 05:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
many individuals that they've served um
 
05:01:45.190 --> 05:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
the recovery
 
05:01:47.150 --> 05:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
residences um the ones that were
 
05:01:49.270 --> 05:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
certified I talked about the certifying
 
05:01:53.830 --> 05:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
body um and that assures that um quality
 
05:01:59.070 --> 05:01:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
workplace now oh State opioid response
 
05:02:04.510 --> 05:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
is another separate slide here we've
 
05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about it um sure I just
 
05:02:11.150 --> 05:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
want to back representative it's me go
 
05:02:15.150 --> 05:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
um what is a what kind of give me a feel
 
05:02:18.670 --> 05:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
for what a recovery friendly workplace
 
05:02:21.708 --> 05:02:21.718 align:start position:0%
constitutes absolutely so there is a
 
05:02:27.230 --> 05:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
program in which um a business um can be
 
05:02:30.510 --> 05:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
deemed a recovery friendly workplace it
 
05:02:32.910 --> 05:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
is um I'm waiting for someone to get up
 
05:02:32.920 --> 05:02:33.788 align:start position:0%
is um I'm waiting for someone to get up
behind

05:02:33.788 --> 05:02:33.798 align:start position:0%
behind
 
05:02:37.868 --> 05:02:37.878 align:start position:0%
me um no such luck no that's okay I
 
05:02:40.510 --> 05:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
don't need them to but I heard footsteps
 
05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
um so it's a business that wants to be
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
able to re attract and maintain um staff
 
05:02:50.030 --> 05:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
and as you know there have been Staffing
 
05:02:52.590 --> 05:02:52.600 align:start position:0%
shortages across a whole bunch of
 
05:02:55.548 --> 05:02:55.558 align:start position:0%
different um Fields including
 
05:02:58.830 --> 05:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and um in health care
 
05:03:01.750 --> 05:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
settings and by deeming themselves and
 
05:03:03.868 --> 05:03:03.878 align:start position:0%
going through a process where they go
 
05:03:06.590 --> 05:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
through um a checklist to make sure that
 
05:03:09.310 --> 05:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
they have the right components in place
 
05:03:12.990 --> 05:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
to be part of this program um they're
 
05:03:17.310 --> 05:03:17.320 align:start position:0%
able to um advertise that and then uh
 
05:03:20.628 --> 05:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
really help and give that assistance to
 
05:03:23.990 --> 05:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
um the people who um work for them as
 
05:03:25.990 --> 05:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
they so that they don't lose a job so
 
05:03:28.470 --> 05:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
that there's not the absenteeism so
 
05:03:31.708 --> 05:03:31.718 align:start position:0%
there is that active um process in
 
05:03:33.868 --> 05:03:33.878 align:start position:0%
helping them in their recovery and
 
05:03:37.788 --> 05:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
maintain recovery um new the state of
 
05:03:40.110 --> 05:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um the department is a
 
05:03:42.548 --> 05:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
recovery friendly workplace um but there
 
05:03:45.110 --> 05:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
are many businesses and there's a long
 
05:03:48.150 --> 05:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
list of businesses that um are part of
 
05:03:48.160 --> 05:03:49.270 align:start position:0%
list of businesses that um are part of
this

05:03:49.270 --> 05:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:03:53.750 --> 05:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:57.070 --> 05:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
you all right State opioid response I
 
05:03:59.910 --> 05:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
think we've talked a lot about this um
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
in um scattered throughout all of the
 
05:04:05.910 --> 05:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
programming because we have braided
 
05:04:08.868 --> 05:04:08.878 align:start position:0%
funding and um have built upon efforts
 
05:04:13.030 --> 05:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
that have um either we started by um the
 
05:04:15.788 --> 05:04:15.798 align:start position:0%
that particular funding source or that
 
05:04:18.788 --> 05:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
we're able to um enhance and support and
 
05:04:22.830 --> 05:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
augment uh with that funding source so
 
05:04:25.310 --> 05:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
the idea of the doorways um they're
 
05:04:28.230 --> 05:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
strategically located in nine locations
 
05:04:31.150 --> 05:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
so that it is easy for people to access
 
05:04:33.990 --> 05:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
services within an hour any other state
 
05:04:36.590 --> 05:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
or populated state you'd say an hour I'm
 
05:04:38.070 --> 05:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
not going to take an hour but New
 
05:04:40.190 --> 05:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we know an hour is pretty
 
05:04:44.708 --> 05:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
close um and that there is an Inc um an
 
05:04:47.590 --> 05:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
increase in standardization of
 
05:04:52.430 --> 05:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
services um and that um the go main goal
 
05:04:53.628 --> 05:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
is to
 
05:04:57.990 --> 05:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
decrease um the overdose deaths um so
 
05:05:00.150 --> 05:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
that is something that we're measuring
 
05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
against and um we fund as I said I think
 
05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's about 30 uh contracts um that are
 
05:05:10.270 --> 05:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
going through that uh cont Contracting
 
05:05:13.150 --> 05:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
process right now we have the doorways
 
05:05:15.868 --> 05:05:15.878 align:start position:0%
that are open during typical um daytime
 
05:05:18.990 --> 05:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
hours they're in hospitals um Hospital
 
05:05:19.000 --> 05:05:19.910 align:start position:0%
hours they're in hospitals um Hospital
based

05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
based
 
05:05:22.750 --> 05:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
locations um and then we have an after
 
05:05:25.830 --> 05:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
hours uh so that if someone's in crisis
 
05:05:27.548 --> 05:05:27.558 align:start position:0%
not only could they have mobile crisis
 
05:05:30.628 --> 05:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
and call that they also have the
 
05:05:32.510 --> 05:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
clinical coverage where they can get
 
05:05:35.750 --> 05:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
some um supports until they can get to
 
05:05:38.670 --> 05:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
the doorway physically the next day so
 
05:05:40.548 --> 05:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
we do that through
 
05:05:44.070 --> 05:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
211 um again medications comes up here
 
05:05:46.948 --> 05:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
we are able to support um those
 
05:05:50.708 --> 05:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
medications for treatment we have a
 
05:05:53.230 --> 05:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
collaboration yesterday I was before the
 
05:05:55.948 --> 05:05:55.958 align:start position:0%
executive council with anou with
 
05:05:58.990 --> 05:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
corrections so that we're able to um
 
05:06:02.310 --> 05:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
support the services that they provide
 
05:06:04.390 --> 05:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
to individuals who are transitioning to
 
05:06:07.310 --> 05:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
the community um so that includes nck
 
05:06:11.830 --> 05:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
Zone training on Nock zone for staff um
 
05:06:15.390 --> 05:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
and um some other services that are able
 
05:06:17.868 --> 05:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
to be provided by
 
05:06:21.310 --> 05:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
doc um recovery housing crisis respit
 
05:06:23.430 --> 05:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot about some of uh
 
05:06:27.150 --> 05:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
these services and um we do have a
 
05:06:29.230 --> 05:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
relationship and are able to provide
 
05:06:32.190 --> 05:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
some assistance to the drug overdose
 
05:06:34.548 --> 05:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
fatality review commission which looks
 
05:06:37.350 --> 05:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
at cases typically um that have been
 
05:06:39.750 --> 05:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
closed and brings the parties that are
 
05:06:42.350 --> 05:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
involved in that particular uh death
 
05:06:44.670 --> 05:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
together so that they're able to learn
 
05:06:47.548 --> 05:06:47.558 align:start position:0%
from that process and to be able to make
 
05:06:50.548 --> 05:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
any policy changes that are needed um so
 
05:06:55.110 --> 05:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:58.230 --> 05:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
go and the last
 
05:07:00.788 --> 05:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
slide going just reviewing our
 
05:07:00.798 --> 05:07:07.788 align:start position:0%
slide going just reviewing our
prioritized

05:07:07.788 --> 05:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:10.830 --> 05:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
needs so as you can see we did um very
 
05:07:13.350 --> 05:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
well with our prioritized needs we um
 
05:07:15.430 --> 05:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
are very fortunate to continue to
 
05:07:17.510 --> 05:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
receive the support from the governor
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
and hopefully the legislature as we uh
 
05:07:22.910 --> 05:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
carry out the functions and the needs of
 
05:07:24.830 --> 05:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
individuals with behavioral health
 
05:07:28.310 --> 05:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
conditions we had the
 
05:07:31.868 --> 05:07:31.878 align:start position:0%
um the um uncompensated care the $5
 
05:07:34.910 --> 05:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
million in each of those uh each fiscal
 
05:07:38.230 --> 05:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
year um that was noted the shelter rate
 
05:07:41.910 --> 05:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
increases that were um done in this uh
 
05:07:43.910 --> 05:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year and those will
 
05:07:46.350 --> 05:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
continue to carry forward if they remain
 
05:07:49.270 --> 05:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
in the budget um to keep at that
 
05:07:54.310 --> 05:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
$27 um per bed per DM um we have the
 
05:07:56.910 --> 05:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
Waypoint uh shelter that was
 
05:08:00.310 --> 05:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
funded one area that you'll be hearing
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
um more about I'm sure from uh the
 
05:08:05.548 --> 05:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
community is Guardianship
 
05:08:08.830 --> 05:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
Services um so we had asked for
 
05:08:08.840 --> 05:08:10.110 align:start position:0%
Services um so we had asked for
additional

05:08:10.110 --> 05:08:10.120 align:start position:0%
additional
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh funding to
 
05:08:16.350 --> 05:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
increase um the um number um that
 
05:08:18.150 --> 05:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
they're able to serve as well as the
 
05:08:20.628 --> 05:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
rates and we that was not
 
05:08:24.750 --> 05:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
funded and then um we had as we
 
05:08:28.948 --> 05:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
referenced 1573 HB 1573 that we receive
 
05:08:31.830 --> 05:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
some funding that funding will stretch
 
05:08:34.628 --> 05:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
um through the bayum but not for the
 
05:08:36.830 --> 05:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
last 6 months so that was a prioritized
 
05:08:39.670 --> 05:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
need that we put in to um be able to
 
05:08:41.628 --> 05:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
cover that last 6 months for that
 
05:08:43.590 --> 05:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
increased oversight of residential
 
05:08:46.990 --> 05:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
programs and um so that that was um put
 
05:08:49.270 --> 05:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
into this
 
05:08:53.628 --> 05:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
budget the cross divisional with um DCF
 
05:08:55.948 --> 05:08:55.958 align:start position:0%
we talked about the provider rates and
 
05:08:58.310 --> 05:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
whether there was an increase for the
 
05:09:04.750 --> 05:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
rates um and so the um rates were not
 
05:09:08.750 --> 05:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
funded but the um amount that we need to
 
05:09:12.868 --> 05:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
make up for a loss of federal funds um
 
05:09:16.190 --> 05:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
was in part supported um with half the
 
05:09:18.310 --> 05:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
amount that we asked for we asked for 18
 
05:09:21.510 --> 05:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
million and we received 9 million
 
05:09:23.390 --> 05:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative priest has recognized for
 
05:09:23.400 --> 05:09:24.390 align:start position:0%
representative priest has recognized for
a

05:09:24.390 --> 05:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:09:27.150 --> 05:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you Madame chairman uh
 
05:09:29.350 --> 05:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
05:09:31.750 --> 05:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
going back to the guardian Services
 
05:09:34.030 --> 05:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
could you just give us a brief
 
05:09:38.190 --> 05:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
explanation of what that is sure so
 
05:09:42.150 --> 05:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
there are individual ual who um are go
 
05:09:44.708 --> 05:09:44.718 align:start position:0%
through a process of being determined to
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
need a guardian to make decisions on
 
05:09:50.310 --> 05:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
their behalf and so in the behavioral
 
05:09:54.390 --> 05:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
health field and in with um individuals
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
with um intellectual disorders they are
 
05:10:00.948 --> 05:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
appointed Guardians and so the Guardians
 
05:10:04.190 --> 05:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
um are provided through um two contracts
 
05:10:08.548 --> 05:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
that we have um and so um that's an area
 
05:10:10.868 --> 05:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
that um is typically
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:18.830 --> 05:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
support would one of those Services be
 
05:10:22.868 --> 05:10:22.878 align:start position:0%
cassa that you cassa is a very very
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
important um part of the child
 
05:10:28.590 --> 05:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
protection and child welfare system that
 
05:10:32.110 --> 05:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
is not covered here representative Nanos
 
05:10:35.070 --> 05:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
repres recognize for question that's
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
court appointed or is that's outside of
 
05:10:43.150 --> 05:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:46.910 --> 05:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
both um I will defer to that I believe
 
05:10:50.990 --> 05:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
that it is um deemed you have to um be
 
05:10:53.310 --> 05:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
con you have to go to court to get a
 
05:10:56.470 --> 05:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
guardianship so if I had an elderly
 
05:10:59.708 --> 05:10:59.718 align:start position:0%
parent and I wanted to be their Guardian
 
05:11:02.150 --> 05:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
um if they didn't voluntarily um you
 
05:11:04.830 --> 05:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
know petition or ask for a guardian then
 
05:11:06.750 --> 05:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
I would go to the court and ask for
 
05:11:09.350 --> 05:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
guardianship but I if I have that wrong
 
05:11:11.510 --> 05:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
um I'll make sure that we correct that
 
05:11:13.948 --> 05:11:13.958 align:start position:0%
so I'm just curious on on the funding of
 
05:11:17.470 --> 05:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
that is is it you know um and I don't
 
05:11:19.350 --> 05:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
have a a great understanding of that
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
whole process because we've never had to
 
05:11:23.750 --> 05:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
go through it but if it's court
 
05:11:27.390 --> 05:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
appointed the the costs any other places
 
05:11:29.628 --> 05:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
in the state budget where that's covered
 
05:11:33.548 --> 05:11:33.558 align:start position:0%
legal services or or is it entirely in
 
05:11:37.628 --> 05:11:37.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:40.548 --> 05:11:40.558 align:start position:0%
budget we we we we have we have other
 
05:11:42.670 --> 05:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
costs throughout our budget that are the
 
05:11:45.150 --> 05:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
result of court-based decisions I mean
 
05:11:47.230 --> 05:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
children entering the dcyf system is a
 
05:11:49.548 --> 05:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
good example earlier we were looking at
 
05:11:51.868 --> 05:11:51.878 align:start position:0%
an accounting unit that had um
 
05:11:54.390 --> 05:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
assessments that that are required so
 
05:11:56.628 --> 05:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
it's it's certainly not that unusual to
 
05:12:00.350 --> 05:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
have have a cost be be driven
 
05:12:06.788 --> 05:12:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank all right I think that concludes
 
05:12:13.070 --> 05:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
our presentation for today there is a
 
05:12:14.788 --> 05:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
lot of information that's in my head
 
05:12:16.788 --> 05:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
that didn't come out of my mouth and I'm
 
05:12:18.788 --> 05:12:18.798 align:start position:0%
sure you have a lot of questions that
 
05:12:22.390 --> 05:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
you hadn't yet um articulated so be
 
05:12:25.868 --> 05:12:25.878 align:start position:0%
happy to um answer and respond to the
 
05:12:28.548 --> 05:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
questions you did ask today and to be
 
05:12:30.628 --> 05:12:30.638 align:start position:0%

are very mindful of the hours that go
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
into uh a presentation like this it's
 
05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
like I used to tell my students you know
 
05:12:49.830 --> 05:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
you see the teacher in the classroom but
 
05:12:52.270 --> 05:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
that's not all they do there's a lot of
 
05:12:54.390 --> 05:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes that have to be
 
05:12:56.590 --> 05:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
appreciated in terms of the time and
 
05:12:59.270 --> 05:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
talent that it takes to actually appear
 
05:13:01.390 --> 05:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
and you have done that so thank you very

group and I'm uh though I represent and
 
05:14:10.788 --> 05:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
work with a lot of folks uh in the
 
05:14:12.350 --> 05:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid system and we'll be here quite
 
05:14:15.868 --> 05:14:15.878 align:start position:0%
a bit I did want to focus a bit on my um
 
05:14:17.548 --> 05:14:17.558 align:start position:0%
if in case of listening on YouTube my
 
05:14:19.510 --> 05:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
favorite client uh the be the community
 
05:14:21.750 --> 05:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
Behavior Health Association which is the
 
05:14:24.030 --> 05:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
10 Community Mental Health Centers um
 
05:14:25.390 --> 05:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
first of all let me just Echo what the
 
05:14:27.708 --> 05:14:27.718 align:start position:0%
committee has already said um you know
 
05:14:29.190 --> 05:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
we really see the work that we do with
 
05:14:30.750 --> 05:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
the department and the bureau as a
 
05:14:32.830 --> 05:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
partnership uh the 10 Community Mental
 
05:14:34.548 --> 05:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
Health Centers care for about 50,000
 
05:14:37.190 --> 05:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
people a year the vast majority of those
 
05:14:39.548 --> 05:14:39.558 align:start position:0%
are uh medic the vast majority the
 
05:14:40.990 --> 05:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
funding for that comes through Medicaid
 
05:14:43.670 --> 05:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
and um our working relationship with the
 
05:14:45.390 --> 05:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
Department is excellent and so I
 
05:14:47.670 --> 05:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh just as you have the work
 
05:14:49.628 --> 05:14:49.638 align:start position:0%
that uh ker and the team put into the
 
05:14:52.788 --> 05:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
presentation today um I'll be relatively
 
05:14:54.110 --> 05:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
brief I just want to highlight the
 
05:14:56.750 --> 05:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
committee to three things three things
 
05:14:59.190 --> 05:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
that we'll be asking for in the context
 
05:15:00.750 --> 05:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
of the budget above and beyond what
 
05:15:04.030 --> 05:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
you've seen in the funded priorities um
 
05:15:07.310 --> 05:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh the first is uh we are joining with
 
05:15:10.670 --> 05:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
other um uh providers in the New
 
05:15:13.788 --> 05:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Healthcare Workforce Coalition
 
05:15:17.270 --> 05:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh in supporting uh a 3% rate increase
 
05:15:18.990 --> 05:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid providers in the upcoming
 
05:15:21.430 --> 05:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
budget uh many in this committee might
 
05:15:24.350 --> 05:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of work was put into a
 
05:15:27.230 --> 05:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
pretty significant adjustment in rates
 
05:15:30.788 --> 05:15:30.798 align:start position:0%
um in the last budget um our hope as we
 
05:15:33.788 --> 05:15:33.798 align:start position:0%
move forward is to come in with modest
 
05:15:36.510 --> 05:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
and needed rate increases each budget
 
05:15:38.990 --> 05:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
cycle so we're not here in Desperate Str
 
05:15:41.628 --> 05:15:41.638 align:start position:0%
rates every 10 years and so we did
 
05:15:45.030 --> 05:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
survey the uh provider Community um
 
05:15:47.030 --> 05:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
across the 23 rate cycles that we went
 
05:15:48.310 --> 05:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
through in all the spreadsheets two
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
years ago uh and remarkably found that
 
05:15:53.430 --> 05:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
with very few exceptions many felt as
 
05:15:56.070 --> 05:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
though the 3% was what was needed and
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
didn't ask to go above and beyond that
 
05:16:02.590 --> 05:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
um uh in addition to that uh the
 
05:16:03.910 --> 05:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers have
 
05:16:05.788 --> 05:16:05.798 align:start position:0%
legislation pending in the Senate with
 
05:16:08.390 --> 05:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
an appropriation on it that deals some
 
05:16:11.230 --> 05:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
with some very important housing issues
 
05:16:14.590 --> 05:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
um as um director Fox pointed out on
 
05:16:16.910 --> 05:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
number of occasions with you all uh for
 
05:16:18.390 --> 05:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
many of the folks in Medicaid that we
 
05:16:21.948 --> 05:16:21.958 align:start position:0%
care for uh room and board are not um
 
05:16:24.350 --> 05:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid allowable expenses and so
 
05:16:26.590 --> 05:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the um Community Mental
 
05:16:28.310 --> 05:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
Health Centers that run those programs
 
05:16:30.670 --> 05:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
have to struggle to put them together so
 
05:16:32.430 --> 05:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
there is a Senate bill that asks for
 
05:16:34.868 --> 05:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation to support
 
05:16:36.830 --> 05:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
that activity uh and to be honest with
 
05:16:40.190 --> 05:16:40.200 align:start position:0%
you um I do not remember the name number
 
05:16:42.270 --> 05:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
um but we'll get it to you my expect and
 
05:16:44.628 --> 05:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
it it had a favorable recommendation in
 
05:16:47.110 --> 05:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
Senate Finance um but I presume that
 
05:16:50.430 --> 05:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
they will um as With Many Items U pass
 
05:16:52.670 --> 05:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
it out a committee and table it awaiting
 
05:16:54.310 --> 05:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
the work waiting for the the bill to
 
05:16:55.948 --> 05:16:55.958 align:start position:0%
come over the Senate you'll see that
 
05:16:59.470 --> 05:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
whole laundry list I expect but uh our
 
05:17:02.190 --> 05:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
hope is this one is on top um the last
 
05:17:04.470 --> 05:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
point that I wanted to um talk about
 
05:17:07.310 --> 05:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
today is the issue of uncompensated care
 
05:17:09.670 --> 05:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
um as you heard from director Fox
 
05:17:11.708 --> 05:17:11.718 align:start position:0%
uh in the governor uh Provisions have
 
05:17:15.190 --> 05:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
been made in the uh House Bill one as
 
05:17:17.590 --> 05:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
introduced uh to fund some of the
 
05:17:20.270 --> 05:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
uncompensated Care uh that the community
 
05:17:22.310 --> 05:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
mental health centers are experiencing
 
05:17:24.948 --> 05:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh the material that uh Mr Ripple passed
 
05:17:28.708 --> 05:17:28.718 align:start position:0%
out um is a part of a work product that
 
05:17:30.750 --> 05:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
was we undertook from the Community
 
05:17:32.910 --> 05:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Center is to figure out uh
 
05:17:34.590 --> 05:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
we know we have uncompensated care but
 
05:17:38.470 --> 05:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
where is it coming from um and so the uh
 
05:17:41.310 --> 05:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
the D spreadsheet organizes it by the 10
 
05:17:42.990 --> 05:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
Community ment Health Centers and then
 
05:17:44.948 --> 05:17:44.958 align:start position:0%
the the document you have here which is
 
05:17:47.628 --> 05:17:47.638 align:start position:0%
a little data it's outlined on the in as
 
05:17:49.990 --> 05:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
a November document the first part of it
 
05:17:52.270 --> 05:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
describes uh what is driving the
 
05:17:56.030 --> 05:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care uh and it outlines uh
 
05:17:58.230 --> 05:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
the sectors which are outlined in the
 
05:18:00.750 --> 05:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet here and they range from
 
05:18:02.948 --> 05:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
underfunding of Medicaid associated with
 
05:18:04.830 --> 05:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid spend down
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
programs um uh concerns at the mental
 
05:18:10.070 --> 05:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
health centers are experiencing with
 
05:18:12.788 --> 05:18:12.798 align:start position:0%
regard to uh folks that have commercial
 
05:18:15.708 --> 05:18:15.718 align:start position:0%
insurance but can't afford and don't pay
 
05:18:17.868 --> 05:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
their co-pays and co-
 
05:18:21.948 --> 05:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
Insurance um which as you know uh from
 
05:18:24.590 --> 05:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
the uh state law that you all have
 
05:18:26.548 --> 05:18:26.558 align:start position:0%
enacted and continue to act that the
 
05:18:28.150 --> 05:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers like
 
05:18:31.270 --> 05:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
some other safety net agencies must care
 
05:18:33.270 --> 05:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
for folks that come in the door
 
05:18:35.670 --> 05:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of their ability to pay so
 
05:18:36.830 --> 05:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
we're seeing
 
05:18:39.708 --> 05:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
increasingly primarily the increasing
 
05:18:42.868 --> 05:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
coming from the commercial payers um who
 
05:18:46.070 --> 05:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
have very high co-pays of co- Insurance
 
05:18:48.230 --> 05:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
um but of probably more significant
 
05:18:51.390 --> 05:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
importance they don't pay for necessary
 
05:18:53.548 --> 05:18:53.558 align:start position:0%
services that are the services that are
 
05:18:56.270 --> 05:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
provided to Medicaid uh recipients so
 
05:18:58.510 --> 05:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
what we're um seeing if you look at the
 
05:19:02.990 --> 05:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that I gave you um in the uh
 
05:19:04.788 --> 05:19:04.798 align:start position:0%
far right hand column the very top
 
05:19:07.788 --> 05:19:07.798 align:start position:0%
number and the very bottom is number uh
 
05:19:11.270 --> 05:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
is that in 202 24 we experienced a $15.4
 
05:19:14.310 --> 05:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
million uncompensated care hit to the
 
05:19:16.190 --> 05:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers which as
 
05:19:19.110 --> 05:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
you can see amounted to a
 
05:19:23.190 --> 05:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
12% um uh differential when as compared
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
to our Medicaid payments what's
 
05:19:27.230 --> 05:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
remarkable there is if you look at from
 
05:19:30.868 --> 05:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
2021 to 2024 uh it has doubled uh it's
 
05:19:32.670 --> 05:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
gone from 6% to
 
05:19:35.868 --> 05:19:35.878 align:start position:0%
12% um uh we are attempting to try to
 
05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
resolve some of the um private payer
 
05:19:41.868 --> 05:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
issues uh and had filed legislation in
 
05:19:45.110 --> 05:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh that um I I suspect is
 
05:19:46.390 --> 05:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
probably not going to advance this
 
05:19:48.390 --> 05:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
session which would have charged an
 
05:19:50.628 --> 05:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
assessment to the commercial providers
 
05:19:55.670 --> 05:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
who are not um uh uh um paying for
 
05:19:57.470 --> 05:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
necessary care through the commercial
 
05:20:01.628 --> 05:20:01.638 align:start position:0%
products uh we have uh uh failed to yet
 
05:20:03.390 --> 05:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
to get the support of the Department of
 
05:20:06.350 --> 05:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
Insurance or the or the insurers for
 
05:20:07.868 --> 05:20:07.878 align:start position:0%
this approach but want to continue to
 
05:20:09.350 --> 05:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
work on that
 
05:20:14.430 --> 05:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
um so among uh the uh things that we are
 
05:20:16.708 --> 05:20:16.718 align:start position:0%
working on it may be coming back to this
 
05:20:19.030 --> 05:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
committee with is a proposal that would
 
05:20:20.830 --> 05:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
set up a mechanism at the Department of
 
05:20:22.548 --> 05:20:22.558 align:start position:0%
Insurance to try to address some of the
 
05:20:25.788 --> 05:20:25.798 align:start position:0%
commercial carrier uncompensated care
 
05:20:28.110 --> 05:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
but in doing so we might a we might ask
 
05:20:30.910 --> 05:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
you to frontload the uncompensated Care
 
05:20:32.470 --> 05:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
number that's in the budget so rather
 
05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
than doing five and five frontload it to
 
05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
10 to stabilize things for the community
 
05:20:41.390 --> 05:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
mental to Health Centers and in that uh
 
05:20:44.350 --> 05:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
in that that year of stability we will
 
05:20:45.830 --> 05:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
be trying to work with the Department of
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
Insurance to improve the situation with
 
05:20:50.750 --> 05:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
regard to commercial
 
05:20:54.788 --> 05:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
coverage um and then the last thing I
 
05:20:58.910 --> 05:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
want to do is um I'm going to leave this
 
05:21:00.548 --> 05:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
for the committee and leave it on the
 
05:21:02.990 --> 05:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
table so that as you look at proposals
 
05:21:05.150 --> 05:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
that come before you you look through
 
05:21:06.788 --> 05:21:06.798 align:start position:0%
the I was going to write uncompensated
 
05:21:07.948 --> 05:21:07.958 align:start position:0%
Care on this but through the
 
05:21:10.868 --> 05:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care lens that we are all
 
05:21:14.510 --> 05:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
looking for so I know that there will be
 
05:21:16.590 --> 05:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
uh more comment on this next week but
 
05:21:17.788 --> 05:21:17.798 align:start position:0%
when you take a look at some of the
 
05:21:19.548 --> 05:21:19.558 align:start position:0%
issues proposed in the governor's budget
 
05:21:21.470 --> 05:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
which you know we're we're still
 
05:21:24.910 --> 05:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
evaluating with regard to copays and and
 
05:21:27.708 --> 05:21:27.718 align:start position:0%
premium contributions uh and the work
 
05:21:29.190 --> 05:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
requirement issues that are around we
 
05:21:32.590 --> 05:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
want to be very conscious that um that
 
05:21:35.190 --> 05:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
the impact of those Provisions are not
 
05:21:37.948 --> 05:21:37.958 align:start position:0%
to create more uncompensated care for
 
05:21:40.150 --> 05:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
the mental health centers recognizing
 
05:21:43.270 --> 05:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
there a state law that says we have to
 
05:21:45.110 --> 05:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
care for folks regardless of their
 
05:21:47.708 --> 05:21:47.718 align:start position:0%
ability to pay if they lose their
 
05:21:50.230 --> 05:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
coverage because of administrative
 
05:21:52.510 --> 05:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
burdens around a work requirement or
 
05:21:55.110 --> 05:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
because the family is unable to pay uh a
 
05:21:58.230 --> 05:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
premium uh the impact of that typically
 
05:22:00.910 --> 05:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
falls to the provider and for providers
 
05:22:04.830 --> 05:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
that can't um deny care for people it
 
05:22:06.590 --> 05:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
really just get gets absorbed as
 
05:22:09.510 --> 05:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
additional uncompensated care
 
05:22:13.990 --> 05:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
so those are uh um uh things we'll be
 
05:22:15.470 --> 05:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
hoping to work with the committee on
 
05:22:17.990 --> 05:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
over the next several weeks and in uh
 
05:22:19.310 --> 05:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
several months when we bring the Senate
 
05:22:20.948 --> 05:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
into it but I wanted to thank you for
 
05:22:22.830 --> 05:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to alert you to those
 
05:22:25.350 --> 05:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
today thank you very much yes be sure to
 
05:22:27.190 --> 05:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
leave that magnifying glass in a place
 
05:22:30.390 --> 05:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
where we can all find it right there any
 
05:22:34.470 --> 05:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative n valano
 
05:22:34.480 --> 05:22:36.430 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative n valano
Nano

05:22:36.430 --> 05:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
Nano
 
05:22:39.150 --> 05:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
Nano you see representative the deeper I
 
05:22:42.030 --> 05:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
am in concentration and the materials in
 
05:22:44.470 --> 05:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
front of me the uh the more likely it is
 
05:22:45.948 --> 05:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
I may mispronounce no problem you're
 
05:22:48.310 --> 05:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
closer than a lot of
 
05:22:52.510 --> 05:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
in-laws um a question uh is U
 
05:22:55.548 --> 05:22:55.558 align:start position:0%
transparency in pricing across you know
 
05:22:58.470 --> 05:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
for for for procedures U all kinds of
 
05:22:59.830 --> 05:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
services that are provided in the
 
05:23:01.830 --> 05:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
medical health field which I think
 
05:23:04.868 --> 05:23:04.878 align:start position:0%
contribute to the uncompensated you know
 
05:23:07.070 --> 05:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's an uneven distribution some places
 
05:23:11.470 --> 05:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
charge X some charge I and I assume that
 
05:23:14.190 --> 05:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
that contributes to a level of
 
05:23:16.110 --> 05:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care depending on where
 
05:23:18.390 --> 05:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
you go for the for the service whether
 
05:23:19.910 --> 05:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
you have insurance or you don't have
 
05:23:22.590 --> 05:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
insurance and I'm just wondering whether
 
05:23:25.628 --> 05:23:25.638 align:start position:0%
you U uh see potentially some of the
 
05:23:27.910 --> 05:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
reforms that are that are kind of
 
05:23:30.788 --> 05:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
requiring transparency in so you know
 
05:23:32.670 --> 05:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
upfront what you're paying for a service
 
05:23:35.510 --> 05:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
or a drug or that sort of thing would
 
05:23:38.868 --> 05:23:38.878 align:start position:0%
that play a role in helping to alleviate
 
05:23:41.708 --> 05:23:41.718 align:start position:0%
uh some of the issue that we have here
 
05:23:43.150 --> 05:23:43.160 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting perspective I think
 
05:23:44.470 --> 05:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
you're looking for the perspective of
 
05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
the person who's purchasing insurance
 
05:23:48.390 --> 05:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
and whether or not there's transparency
 
05:23:50.548 --> 05:23:50.558 align:start position:0%
in the coverage and the in the cost well
 
05:23:52.548 --> 05:23:52.558 align:start position:0%
it's how you're how you're you know you
 
05:23:54.948 --> 05:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
have an insurance policy and you decide
 
05:23:57.230 --> 05:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
to go to one place or the other and
 
05:23:58.910 --> 05:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
there's a difference you know I've seen
 
05:24:00.430 --> 05:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
it in my own insurance coverage
 
05:24:03.070 --> 05:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
depending on where where you go the cost
 
05:24:05.150 --> 05:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
of the same service may be different at
 
05:24:08.350 --> 05:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
different uh uh different hospitals or
 
05:24:09.708 --> 05:24:09.718 align:start position:0%
for different
 
05:24:13.030 --> 05:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
providers um and that in turn I think
 
05:24:15.628 --> 05:24:15.638 align:start position:0%
contributes to how much of it is funded
 
05:24:18.590 --> 05:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
you know uh funded or unfunded you know
 
05:24:20.990 --> 05:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
in network out of network there's a
 
05:24:23.868 --> 05:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
whole host of arms and legs on on this
 
05:24:26.548 --> 05:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
uh thing that I I would think contribute
 
05:24:29.990 --> 05:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
to a certain extent greater or lesser uh
 
05:24:32.948 --> 05:24:32.958 align:start position:0%
on the uncom so-called uncompensated
 
05:24:36.230 --> 05:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
care aspect of this yeah I think our
 
05:24:37.708 --> 05:24:37.718 align:start position:0%
first look at the uncompensated care
 
05:24:38.708 --> 05:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
piece and the commcial commercial
 
05:24:41.190 --> 05:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
environment are uh services and codes
 
05:24:44.070 --> 05:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
that all commercial insurers don't cover
 
05:24:46.830 --> 05:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh and uh but beyond that I think and
 
05:24:48.270 --> 05:24:48.280 align:start position:0%
this is something commissioner bonc
 
05:24:49.948 --> 05:24:49.958 align:start position:0%
deserves to try to figure out which is
 
05:24:52.110 --> 05:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
in uh I think I'm getting to your
 
05:24:54.110 --> 05:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
question in in in some plans where
 
05:24:55.350 --> 05:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
there's a very high
 
05:24:57.990 --> 05:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
deductible uh or there are different
 
05:25:00.750 --> 05:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
levels of service that what the
 
05:25:02.430 --> 05:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center would be
 
05:25:04.750 --> 05:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
reimburse for the services could be
 
05:25:06.788 --> 05:25:06.798 align:start position:0%
different based upon the insurance
 
05:25:09.270 --> 05:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
product that that the uh the purchaser
 
05:25:11.030 --> 05:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
acquires well not just the insurance
 
05:25:12.548 --> 05:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
product but what the providers are
 
05:25:15.910 --> 05:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
charging I think there's differences uh
 
05:25:19.110 --> 05:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
there as well uh and and also it comes
 
05:25:21.270 --> 05:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
down to how things are coded I think
 
05:25:23.430 --> 05:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
we've all run into the case where you
 
05:25:25.708 --> 05:25:25.718 align:start position:0%
know you go to one provider and they're
 
05:25:29.750 --> 05:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
better at coding uh stuff in terms of an
 
05:25:31.350 --> 05:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
understanding of how the insurance
 
05:25:34.670 --> 05:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
situation works and those that that that
 
05:25:36.830 --> 05:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
aren't as skilled at doing the coding
 
05:25:38.990 --> 05:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
result in different levels of uh
 
05:25:41.510 --> 05:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
compensation and then in turn
 
05:25:45.310 --> 05:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
uncompensated uh uncompensated care yeah
 
05:25:50.310 --> 05:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's probably the the the um a
 
05:25:52.590 --> 05:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
level of the uncompensated Cure issue
 
05:25:54.390 --> 05:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
but what we're trying to work out within
 
05:25:56.788 --> 05:25:56.798 align:start position:0%
with the insurers is let's get a let's
 
05:25:58.628 --> 05:25:58.638 align:start position:0%
all get to the same playing field so
 
05:25:59.750 --> 05:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
that there's an agreement that you're
 
05:26:01.990 --> 05:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
going to pay for a certain service and
 
05:26:04.110 --> 05:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
then it' be up to the
 
05:26:05.910 --> 05:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
individual Community Mental Health
 
05:26:07.990 --> 05:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
Center to negotiate that rate well I
 
05:26:10.750 --> 05:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
come to the to the transparency issue on
 
05:26:12.270 --> 05:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
it's not just what are you going to
 
05:26:13.548 --> 05:26:13.558 align:start position:0%
compensate but what are you going to
 
05:26:15.830 --> 05:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
charge you know if I have a choice
 
05:26:18.910 --> 05:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
between you know two places that charge
 
05:26:20.910 --> 05:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
the charge different things for
 
05:26:22.548 --> 05:26:22.558 align:start position:0%
essentially the same product I can make
 
05:26:24.948 --> 05:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
a judgment on quality and I can make a
 
05:26:27.830 --> 05:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
judgment on on price but as it is you
 
05:26:30.270 --> 05:26:30.280 align:start position:0%
know if I need uh I need treatment I I
 
05:26:32.830 --> 05:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
go or and I don't really look at the
 
05:26:35.868 --> 05:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
cost uh consideration because when you
 
05:26:37.990 --> 05:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
need the care you need the care but it
 
05:26:39.548 --> 05:26:39.558 align:start position:0%
would would be helpful to know that you
 
05:26:43.310 --> 05:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
had an alternative uh maybe same quality
 
05:26:43.320 --> 05:26:44.350 align:start position:0%
had an alternative uh maybe same quality
lower

05:26:44.350 --> 05:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
lower
 
05:26:46.990 --> 05:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
cost but I'm I'm just I'm just throwing
 
05:26:48.470 --> 05:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
that out there because I think it isn't
 
05:26:52.430 --> 05:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
just a um uh an issue of how much the
 
05:26:54.310 --> 05:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
insurance company is going to pay and
 
05:26:55.708 --> 05:26:55.718 align:start position:0%
getting them all on the same page it's
 
05:26:58.270 --> 05:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
the it's the cost and the charge side of
 
05:26:59.390 --> 05:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
this as
 
05:27:02.670 --> 05:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
well so there are two two components of
 
05:27:04.788 --> 05:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
that at least in my view and in in my
 
05:27:07.190 --> 05:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
personal experience we're often quite
 
05:27:09.030 --> 05:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
careful in the way we work with the
 
05:27:10.150 --> 05:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center is
 
05:27:12.788 --> 05:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to be um engaged
 
05:27:15.670 --> 05:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
in any activity where the the center
 
05:27:17.510 --> 05:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
should be negotiating those rates with
 
05:27:21.310 --> 05:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
the provider um uh so I don't disagree
 
05:27:22.868 --> 05:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
with you I just think that's typically
 
05:27:24.910 --> 05:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
the you know kind of the business side
 
05:27:27.310 --> 05:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
of the of the community M Health Center
 
05:27:28.990 --> 05:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
well this is all this is all business
 
05:27:29.000 --> 05:27:29.788 align:start position:0%
well this is all this is all business
isn't

05:27:29.788 --> 05:27:29.798 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
05:27:33.030 --> 05:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
it um right but it's contractual
 
05:27:34.390 --> 05:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
business that has to be operated
 
05:27:36.708 --> 05:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
according to the regulatory rules so you
 
05:27:39.390 --> 05:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
know I I'll leave it as that okay thank
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
you thank you all set thank you very
 
05:27:45.390 --> 05:27:45.400 align:start position:0%

very brief and I want to thank the

thorough presentation new Futures uh
 
05:28:24.230 --> 05:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
works on policy issues on health and
 
05:28:26.110 --> 05:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
wellness and uh we have several buckets
 
05:28:27.390 --> 05:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
of work that will follow and we'll
 
05:28:29.070 --> 05:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
probably talk to you about during this
 
05:28:32.070 --> 05:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
process but today um we are highlighting
 
05:28:34.390 --> 05:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
parts of the division of Behavioral self
 
05:28:36.310 --> 05:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
services um regarding the governor's
 
05:28:38.110 --> 05:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
05:28:40.430 --> 05:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
and children's Behavioral Health I just
 
05:28:43.990 --> 05:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
do want to support um the uh Governor's
 
05:28:46.110 --> 05:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
commission line in the budget we are
 
05:28:48.548 --> 05:28:48.558 align:start position:0%
very pleased to see that the governor
 
05:28:52.868 --> 05:28:52.878 align:start position:0%
did um fully fund that at the 5% level
 
05:28:56.110 --> 05:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
of gross profits from alcohol um because
 
05:28:58.670 --> 05:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
of that we will be able to continue some
 
05:29:02.070 --> 05:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
really important work that we have um
 
05:29:04.070 --> 05:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
undergone in the state regarding um
 
05:29:06.070 --> 05:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder prevention
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
treatment and Recovery um and as you
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
heard from uh director Fox there is a
 
05:29:15.110 --> 05:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
very clear oversight process by the
 
05:29:17.430 --> 05:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission of the expenditure
 
05:29:20.548 --> 05:29:20.558 align:start position:0%
of those funds and by the department so
 
05:29:23.510 --> 05:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
again we support that 5% um allocation
 
05:29:25.310 --> 05:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
in the governor's
 
05:29:27.788 --> 05:29:27.798 align:start position:0%
budget and I would just like to
 
05:29:28.990 --> 05:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
highlight the importance of the
 
05:29:31.230 --> 05:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
children's system of care line item um
 
05:29:33.030 --> 05:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
you heard in depth this morning about
 
05:29:36.030 --> 05:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
that and how um it helps children not
 
05:29:38.750 --> 05:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
just in their youth but long longterm
 
05:29:40.430 --> 05:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
Better Health outcomes across the
 
05:29:42.390 --> 05:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
lifespan I'd also like to just
 
05:29:43.670 --> 05:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
underscore the importance of that
 
05:29:45.150 --> 05:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health Resource
 
05:29:47.628 --> 05:29:47.638 align:start position:0%
Center that you heard about um not only
 
05:29:49.910 --> 05:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
does it provide resources to families in
 
05:29:52.510 --> 05:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um through the website but
 
05:29:55.070 --> 05:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
it also provides um important technical
 
05:29:58.190 --> 05:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
assistance to uh providers to help train
 
05:30:00.030 --> 05:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
up our Workforce and be able to provide
 
05:30:01.670 --> 05:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
those critical services to families
 
05:30:04.948 --> 05:30:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:07.110 --> 05:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
state thank you both would you take
 
05:30:08.590 --> 05:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
questions if there are
 
05:30:11.990 --> 05:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
any questions for members of division
 
05:30:14.590 --> 05:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
3 all set thank you very much for your
 
05:30:18.868 --> 05:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
