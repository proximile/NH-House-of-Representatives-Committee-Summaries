before us here please good morning
 
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
committee members I handed out two
 
00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 align:start position:0%
documents one's an updated
 
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
compare sheet basically the titles got
 
00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 align:start position:0%
in straw poll suggestions you'll see
 
00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 align:start position:0%
that lines are shaded and there's notes
 
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
in the First Column you also get an
 
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.650 align:start position:0%
in the First Column you also get an
amendment

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 25 Amendment which
 
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
incorporates all those changes and I'm
 
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
going to walk you through the amendment
 
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
just to point out where changes were
 
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
made so that you have that before you
 
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
this is going to change after whatever
 
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
your work today but this was just to put
 
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
all your decisions potential decisions
 
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
from Wednesday into a new document in
 
00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment format so you'd see what
 
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 align:start position:0%
it would look like several members had
 
00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 align:start position:0%
indicated they wanted to see it in that
 
00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.729 align:start position:0%
indicated they wanted to see it in that
fashion

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the amendment it's
 
00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
1061 h
 
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 align:start position:0%
on page one
 
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
if you go to line 13
 
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see number three two chillers for
 
00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
29 Hazen drive for three hundred
 
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
the next change that would occur would
 
00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
be on line 16 and that would just be a
 
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
change to that total State appropriation
 
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 align:start position:0%
the number was
 
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
21331 500 it's now excuse me twenty one
 
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
two three one five hundred now it's
 
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
the next place that you've made some
 
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
decisions is in the Department of
 
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 align:start position:0%
Education beginning on line 22.
 
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
was to decrease the Hall Street
 
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation from 10.5 million dollars
 
00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
and then the second decision that you
 
00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
made was to add the winnesquam regional
 
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
CTE Center renovation for 7 million 649
 
00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the comparison sheet
 
00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 align:start position:0%
you'll see that these the things that
 
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about are shaded so you can
 
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
kind of follow along on both if you
 
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
choose to do so
 
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
you turn to page two
 
00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
line three
 
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
this is a an adjustment to the drinking
 
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
water State revolving fund State match
 
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
as you recall that Environmental
 
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
Services said it was forty thousand
 
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
dollars too high so it was reduced down
 
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 align:start position:0%
to 10 million
 
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 align:start position:0%
448 238
 
00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 align:start position:0%
dollars it was originally
 
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
um 10 million four hundred and eighty
 
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
eight thousand so that's where the Forty
 
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
thousand came from
 
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
move down to line 26.
 
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
and all that changed there was the
 
00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
project title so it was expanded out
 
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
from Life Safety improvements to include
 
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
lines nine and ten this was a request of
 
00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:13.610 align:start position:0%
lines nine and ten this was a request of
the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
imaginant General where to split this
 
00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
project so as introduced by the governor
 
00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
the Nashua hazardous material
 
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
remediation had four hundred thousand
 
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
dollars appropriated to it the edge in
 
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
general asked that you reduce that to
 
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.890 align:start position:0%
general asked that you reduce that to
250

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
250
 
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
000 and then use the hundred and fifty
 
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
thousand to a new project of land
 
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
purchase Pembroke and that's what you
 
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
you move down to line 36 on page 3 and
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
line 37 those are the freight rail
 
00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.869 align:start position:0%
line 37 those are the freight rail
Appropriations

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
250 000 for Carol and Stratford
 
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
and 500 000 for co-ops
 
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
and what goes along with that is on the
 
00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
top of page four
 
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
there's a note that requires the
 
00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation to report
 
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
to the capital budget overview Committee
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
in October and April of each year of the
 
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
biennium on the status of this
 
00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 align:start position:0%
appropriation and the match that's
 
00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.490 align:start position:0%
appropriation and the match that's
required

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 align:start position:0%
staying on page four on line six you'll
 
00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
see that you added the community college
 
00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.710 align:start position:0%
see that you added the community college
system

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
and on line seven it's critical
 
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
you move down to um
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
row 28
 
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's the bonds authorized paragraph so
 
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
because you've added or changed money
 
00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
we had to adjust
 
00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:45.230 align:start position:0%
we had to adjust
um

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
and then we had to adjust the general
 
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
fund amount
 
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
and then that will if there's any
 
00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 align:start position:0%
changes to section one or two of the
 
00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
bill those two numbers would be adjusted
 
00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.689 align:start position:0%
bill those two numbers would be adjusted
again

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
moving you to page five
 
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
so it's section 12 of the bill that that
 
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
is amendment one zero zero three h that
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
that includes section
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
so again that all came from the
 
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
amendment 1003h that you approved um
 
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.510 align:start position:0%
amendment 1003h that you approved um
Wednesday

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
line 15 is section 15 of the bill that
 
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
is amendment one zero zero nine H that
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
you approved on Wednesday
 
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
line 21
 
00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
is section 16 of the bill and that was
 
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.029 align:start position:0%
 
m

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
m
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
and then lines 27 through 37
 
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
and then on page seven lines one through
 
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
one and two is all related to Amendment
 
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
um ten zero two zero H that again you
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
approved last Wednesday or tentatively
 
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.969 align:start position:0%
approved last Wednesday or tentatively
approved

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:18.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
on page seven
 
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
line six which is section 21 of the bill
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
that is amendment zero nine eight zero H
 
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
again you you tentatively approve that
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
line 27 which is section 22 of the bill
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
was Amendment one zero zero four h
 
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
so you tentatively approve that on
 
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
um Wednesday but you there was a request
 
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
from the committee to add some language
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
starting on line one it in bold it says
 
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
Appropriations contained in this
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
paragraph must first be applied to
 
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
construction renovation at the Powder
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
Mill Fisher Fish Hatchery and then any
 
00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 align:start position:0%
remaining balance shall be used for
 
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
Statewide Hatchery construction and
 
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
renovation so as you may recall is that
 
00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759 align:start position:0%
there was some concern that this
 
00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259 align:start position:0%
appropriation has been around for one
 
00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
biennium it hasn't been spent at the
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
Powder Mill Hatchery to address some of
 
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
the environmental services concerns
 
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
members were concerned that that needed
 
00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
to be addressed before this money should
 
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
be used elsewhere and so that sentence
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
was added in an effort to um
 
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
help the committee feel comfortable with
 
00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:42.419 align:start position:0%
that Amendment
 
00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:46.139 align:start position:0%
on line five it's a new section
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
and this is section 23 it's titled
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
priority project list
 
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
so on Wednesday you talked a little bit
 
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:56.780 align:start position:0%
about if the CTE
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the winter Squan
 
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
isn't voted on by the members and that
 
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
7.6 million dollars needs to be removed
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
you want to have your wish list or your
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
priority list when you send this over to
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
the Senate to say if that money becomes
 
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
available this is the projects we want
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
or would like you to consider funding
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
this is something you did similarly in
 
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
the last capital budget as it related to
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
arpa funds coming in
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
so this will be amended based on any
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
starting on line eight which is section
 
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
24 of the bill
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
it's called lapse of Prior Capital
 
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
balance this is the money that you've
 
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
been spending that's we've been calling
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
repurposed money
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
so starting on line 12
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
of page eight going through all of page
 
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.449 align:start position:0%
of page eight going through all of page
nine

00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:50.459 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
to the top of page 10
 
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it's a through y
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
these are all the projects that had some
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
money that they didn't spend on a
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
project that we're going to try to
 
00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
repurpose that got you to that three
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
point eight million dollars that you
 
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
you've been spending
 
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.610 align:start position:0%
you've been spending
um

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
you'll see on line seven
 
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
is an appropriation to Health and Human
 
00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
Services of 1.4 million thirty two
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
thousand for the Glencliff wastewater
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
treatment Improvement
 
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:26.060 align:start position:0%
and then on line 10 is the 500 000
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the Connecticut Lakes
 
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
Headwaters Road repairs and Paving
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
and then on line 13
 
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
is the 250 000 appropriation for the
 
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
State Park parking lot repairs and
 
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
right now that that totals 2.18 million
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
dollars that is appropriated you have
 
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
about 1.6 million dollars left of the
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
repurposed money
 
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.570 align:start position:0%
repurposed money
um

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
to consider and and any of any of those
 
00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:04.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
the last section is on 20 line 23 it's
 
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
section 25 and these are all the lapse
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
extensions and that goes to the end of
 
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
the bill and this is what represents
 
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
Jack and and the subcommittee worked on
 
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:20.339 align:start position:0%
earlier in the week to determine what
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
could come in or what needed to be added
 
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
and what could come out and so all those
 
00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:26.060 align:start position:0%
changes have been made
 
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:35.389 align:start position:0%
there is
one

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
one typo on page 20
 
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
line 25 so in the
 
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
it should have said police Hangar
 
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
construction and renovation it says
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
reconstruction so I will get that fixed
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
the next time they do the amendment on
 
00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
this and then the other thing that was
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
adjusted there was another two sections
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
that had a spelling error
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
um the piscataqua
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
River was spelled incorrectly so in
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
those two sections that we've gotten
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
that corrected in this version
 
00:11:08.449 --> 00:11:08.459 align:start position:0%
so those are the majority of the changes
 
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
before you
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr Shea again you're
 
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
talking about the error for the police
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
standards and training which all right
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about the bill the
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
amendment which page and which line
 
00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:27.170 align:start position:0%
amendment which page and which line
please

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
for police standards right yeah I just I
 
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019 align:start position:0%
miss that what you're hearing the
 
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
construction reconstruction oh I'm sorry
 
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.569 align:start position:0%
construction reconstruction oh I'm sorry
yep

00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:35.579 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
yeah so which page so it's page 20. page
 
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
page 20 line 25 line 25 all right so it
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
starts police Hangar construction and
 
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:50.579 align:start position:0%
currently says reconstruction that
 
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
should say renovation to align with the
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
line 23 above okay
 
00:11:59.090 --> 00:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Jack uh
 
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you uh there might be on the uh
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
drinking water srf this would be
 
00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:07.019 align:start position:0%
uh page two line three of the bill
 
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh the the compare report says at the
 
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
end says 83 and the amendment says 38 so
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
it would appear that the typo is in the
 
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
amendment page two yep line three should
 
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
be 283 rather than two three eight
 
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:32.579 align:start position:0%
so on that point and that's a great
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
segue representative Jack
 
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
this is a draft Amendment and if anybody
 
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
notices or finds anything in here that's
 
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:41.660 align:start position:0%
an error
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
spelling error or something's omitted
 
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
or is incorrect please let me know so
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
that I can confirm that it needs to be
 
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.150 align:start position:0%
that I can confirm that it needs to be
changed

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
um better to have multiple sets of eyes
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
looking at something than just one set
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
a paragraph that says they can spend
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
their own money do we need to have that
 
00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.019 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
I contacted the other day just to find
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
out actually Dr Bill Cass but
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
um it was relative to your request that
 
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
you had uh in the big book and it had
 
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
not been uh approved by the governor to
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
be included
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
and and the question that I had that I
 
00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:11.339 align:start position:0%
had at that time was that
 
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
um if in fact these three items that you
 
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
were requesting that was in the original
 
00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.569 align:start position:0%
were requesting that was in the original
book

00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
book
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
um there that there are all highway
 
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.930 align:start position:0%
um there that there are all highway
funds

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
and the question I had was it that was
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
had that been considered in your budget
 
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
and did you have sufficient you know
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
feel you had sufficient funds on hand to
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
be able to handle you know the the debt
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
you'd require from these that that was
 
00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
the basic question
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your question and I'm
 
00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%

um so yes we have already included that
 
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959 align:start position:0%
in the debt service so the first three
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
items that are on that list that impact
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
the highway fund
 
00:16:59.930 --> 00:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
have no further impact it is already in
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
the operating budget and has sailed
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%

apologize so the um
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
the um in reps every year I just want to
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm heading down the right
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
direction here there there's there's a
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
project there that has interest your
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman well in
 
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
particular what uh caused me to ask the
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
the question was it one of the
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
particular items the first one construct
 
00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:45.539 align:start position:0%
salt and sand sheds
 
00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
um had the interest because of it in my
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
in my area uh there is a is actual
 
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
hopefully a move we can make we're
 
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
trying to do something for the rails
 
00:17:59.150 --> 00:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
trails in in some land that is owned by
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
you right now you have some sheds
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
and it is in fact uh to be able to move
 
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:06.539 align:start position:0%
them you'd have to be able to let's say
 
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
uh build finally go through what the
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
project you wanted to do on South Road
 
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
which is also it's actually in
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
Northampton that you if we could take
 
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
those sheds down that are on the
 
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
property right next to the rail Trails
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
did you be able to utilize a a an
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
expanded capacity at uh on South Road in
 
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
Northampton and then and then we'd be
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
able to be talking more about doing
 
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
something else with that land
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
so that that's the original reason why
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
what prompted me to look at uh these
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
particular issues in general and and
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
just getting reminded of the fact that
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
it's uh that it's your funds and you
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that you know you've
 
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
accounted for being able to handle that
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
in your budget
 
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd be strongly supportive of
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
these are uh projects number 49 well the
 
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
one he's speaking of is 49 and then
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
there's 50 and 51 on the agency request
 
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
sheet that we got at the previous
 
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
meeting I'd be strongly supportive of it
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
since they've testified that they can
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
handle this in the highway fund and The
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
Debt Service is already provided for in
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
the Opera in the uh in the budget that
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee is working on
 
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
I'd be strongly supportive of adding
 
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
49.50 and 51.
 
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.490 align:start position:0%
 
departments

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
departments
 
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
um point on that please I I we're not at
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
this point that we're going to add
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
projects where I'm here to get testimony
 
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
and then we'll come back to this
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
so thank you and if I I understand
 
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
um what representative Jack is referring
 
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.870 align:start position:0%
um what representative Jack is referring
to

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
um my numbering I'm not sure if it
 
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.690 align:start position:0%
um my numbering I'm not sure if it
matches

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
matches
 
00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
um but the first one would be construct
 
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
salt and sand sheds and to
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative Edgar's Point passage of
 
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
that will confirm that we have the funds
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
to replace the the Northampton salt shed
 
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
um the second one would be the
 
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
underground fuel tank replacement and
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
the third one would be the crew quarters
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
life life safety issues and the
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
department would certainly
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
um appreciate the the opportunity to
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
move forward with these projects in the
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
next biennium thank you I'm not sure
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%

thank you Shan
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
um Shannon and I had had a conversation
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
a few days back
 
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
with the hope of
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
adding either money into the community
 
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
college for critical maintenance and or
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
for the expanded programming that we
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
spoke of and the conversation at that
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
point was if we could only find one and
 
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
a half million dollars what's the
 
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
preference of the
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the college system and unless that's
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
changed it was for critical maintenance
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
which is what we have plugged in at this
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
point there's also been an ongoing
 
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.529 align:start position:0%
point there's also been an ongoing
conversation

00:22:11.529 --> 00:22:11.539 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
that many on this committee would like
 
00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:18.059 align:start position:0%
to see that a new program started
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
and we're going to talk about that here
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
did I ask what the critical the nature
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
of the critical maintenance is just the
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
scope of what you're
 
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
our request encompasses a number of
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
different projects that include uh roof
 
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:40.810 align:start position:0%
different projects that include uh roof
work

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:40.820 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
boilers rooftop units some HVAC work
 
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:48.110 align:start position:0%
boilers rooftop units some HVAC work
primarily

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative Jairus
 
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Jim and uh so roof work
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
boilers seems to be a common theme
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
throughout the testimony of the other
 
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
departments as well
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
two quick ones
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
is it possible the students get to see
 
00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
how that those projects are uh
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
being installed or designed I mean is
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
there any benefit to the students who
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
are working there to maybe
 
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
go up and take a look on to the
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
contractors learn from the contractors
 
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
or the engineers that's an interesting
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
question that makes me wonder if you
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
have been an educator in your
 
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
professional life
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
um I think there could be we typically
 
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
try to do that work when our campuses
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
are are as sparsely populated as
 
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
possible which tends to be during the
 
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
summer time but you know I see no reason
 
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
we couldn't look into that we do have a
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
at Manchester Community College we have
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
a building that's dedicated to HVAC and
 
00:23:48.169 --> 00:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
it was constructed several of you have
 
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
been there it was constructed as really
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
a a learning lab every part of it is
 
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
open to students the the systems
 
00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
themselves are part of what the students
 
00:23:59.330 --> 00:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
learn on
 
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
um with the critical maintenance I would
 
00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
imagine there would be opportunities for
 
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
some of that to involve students
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
thank you I I do you have a follow-up uh
 
00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.649 align:start position:0%
thank you I I do you have a follow-up uh
briefly

00:24:11.649 --> 00:24:11.659 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
roofs spoilers
 
00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:18.419 align:start position:0%
any you may is renting in the design
 
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
that might include photo voltaics in
 
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.409 align:start position:0%
that might include photo voltaics in
there

00:24:21.409 --> 00:24:21.419 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
for the roofs or any uh
 
00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:26.299 align:start position:0%
heat pumps
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
our critical maintenance request really
 
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
um at this point involve that technology
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
we we have submitted separately a
 
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
request for federal congressionally
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
directed funding for fy24 which I have
 
00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:44.390 align:start position:0%
directed funding for fy24 which I have
no

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
ability to handicap whether that would
 
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:48.419 align:start position:0%
come through or not to do large-scale
 
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
solar installations at all of our
 
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
campuses to help you know reduce our or
 
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
alter our energy consumption but the
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance is really fixing
 
00:24:59.210 --> 00:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
failing roofs making sure that there's
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
no additional damage to buildings from
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
those types of things
 
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Jim thank you yes
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative Abbott
 
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
yes I just had a question on your
 
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
request for the
 
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.970 align:start position:0%
request for the
respiratory

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:15.980 align:start position:0%
respiratory
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
therapy program
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
um antiqued for teaching equipment and
 
00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:24.539 align:start position:0%
teaching space renovation
 
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
at present do you offer a program on
 
00:25:32.049 --> 00:25:32.059 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapy
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
presently not at Nashua Community
 
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
College presently River Valley Community
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
College in Claremont offers a
 
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapy program
 
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
in in conversations with health care
 
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
providers in the Southern Tier of New
 
00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it became clear that there was
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
a real demand in that part of the state
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
for graduates of respiratory therapy
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
programs our plan if the if the NCC
 
00:25:59.210 --> 00:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
project is funded is to create the
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapy labs and basically
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
import the the River Valley Community
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
College program to be offered in Nashua
 
00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
doing it that way avoids having to kind
 
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
of create a new program from Whole cloth
 
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
and go through all the all the Hoops
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
that one jumps through when when one
 
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
creates a new program we basically use
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
the river valley program but just
 
00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:24.419 align:start position:0%
deliver it at Nashua does that does that
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
answer your question
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative Jack thank you
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
following up on my colleague from
 
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
Nashville's question uh the Community
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
College presentation identified 3.425
 
00:26:39.649 --> 00:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
million dollars in critical maintenance
 
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
so what we're doing with this
 
00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation is helping them with that
 
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
um I I would just like to and I'm sure
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's already being done
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
um by the system and I understand the
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
representatives question I like the
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
question and I also fully understand
 
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
that you need to do this when campus is
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
not there do you ever give a shout out
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
for the state for this money and some
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
I'll take you back to elementary school
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
poster board saying that these projects
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
were done on behalf of
 
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
of the school for you know from the
 
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.430 align:start position:0%
of the school for you know from the
state

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
excuse me does it go in a press release
 
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
how do how does someone there who's
 
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
paying higher tuition than other states
 
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
come to realize that there is actually
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh help coming from the state
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
on on major Renovations where new space
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
is created I think we do routinely do
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
something like that for maintenance
 
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
as far as I know we really haven't but I
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
I think that that's a very good idea I
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
think it's important that students
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
understand that the state is supporting
 
00:27:54.049 --> 00:27:54.059 align:start position:0%
their education in a number of different
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
ways I know in New Hampshire there's a
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
refrain that we that we hear that New
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is 50th out of 50 in state
 
00:28:03.409 --> 00:28:03.419 align:start position:0%
support for public education we don't
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
like the message that sends to students
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire actually supports
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
education in ways that may be more more
 
00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:12.779 align:start position:0%
Innovative more Nimble than other states
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
are able to do and we appreciate that I
 
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
think that anything we can do to deliver
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
that message to students is something
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
that we should do
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
thank you and if you could just copy uh
 
00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:24.539 align:start position:0%
copy the committee in when you come up
 
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
with some sort of press release to that
 
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.370 align:start position:0%
with some sort of press release to that
effect

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:27.380 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
we'd be appreciative you need a picture
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
of this good looking group we can do
 
00:28:32.289 --> 00:28:32.299 align:start position:0%
that too
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
anything else at this point yes
 
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.830 align:start position:0%
anything else at this point yes
representative

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
Shannon I just need to follow up
 
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
um on the respiratory therapy if you get
 
00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:43.820 align:start position:0%
that money does it mean the program
 
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:46.740 align:start position:0%
operates exclusively out of Nashua and
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
River Valley discontinues or you're just
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
going to copy River Valley
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
program would continue at both locations
 
00:28:57.049 --> 00:28:57.059 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for making that
 
00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
clear to me also all right any other
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
questions Shannon
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:21.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
so as I understand it
 
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
we have we have
 
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
1.6 million dollars
 
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.889 align:start position:0%
1.6 million dollars
um

00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:33.899 --> 00:29:36.169 align:start position:0%
um
left

00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
left
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
um and there's another 108 000 on the
 
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.750 align:start position:0%
um and there's another 108 000 on the
other

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
items that we added with a hundred and
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
eight thousand left we'll start with
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
that I had a conversation with um with
 
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
Chris about if we had
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
um in past we've added Monies to that
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
and put other monies in the second part
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
which becomes confusing to people and
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
departments going forward so I think
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
we're going to try and keep the two
 
00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:11.419 align:start position:0%
items separate
 
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
yes represent Mills
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair I'd like to follow
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
up on Representatives Jack's proposal uh
 
00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
last week on items on our wish list our
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
agency request wish lists items 44 I'm
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
sorry items 45 46 and 47 for D.O.T which
 
00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:36.539 align:start position:0%
are repairs to Railroad bridges on
 
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
state-owned active railroad lines
 
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
culverts on state our own lines ties and
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
installations there's a three separate
 
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
items and that comes up to a total of
 
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:53.210 align:start position:0%
items and that comes up to a total of
1.67

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
which I think will
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
okay does everyone does everyone have
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
that sheet that uh represent Mills is
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
referring to yeah we had it from last
 
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
dated 314 2023 it was the wish list that
 
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
those line number it was 45 45 46 and
 
00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:48.250 align:start position:0%
those line number it was 45 45 46 and
47.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:48.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
are you making that as a as as a motion
 
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
represented I'm just tossing it out
 
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
there for discussion to see if whether
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
we have any other present projects okay
 
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
they um further discussion
 
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.370 align:start position:0%
they um further discussion
yes

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
on the aviation Grant management
 
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.909 align:start position:0%
on the aviation Grant management
software

00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
software
 
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just that's going to the airports
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
and stuff okay
 
00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:22.070 align:start position:0%
and stuff okay
as

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
been televised through the news of late
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
at our bigger airports and stuff they
 
00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
have software issues that have created
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
safety issues and stuff like that and my
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
curiosity is on some of these smaller uh
 
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
airports that operate
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
will not upgrading this software create
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
other issues down the line for these
 
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
smaller less controlled environments
 
00:32:57.529 --> 00:32:57.539 align:start position:0%
that are being used like in uh for
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
instance the Laconia Guilford airport is
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
a high volume jet airport and
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
they rely on software and stuff to keep
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
them functioning because they don't have
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
a control tower so I'm just curious if
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
that would undermine that by not keeping
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
the software upgraded or not it's more
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
of a question than
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
um and where where in our volumes here
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
where would I find that item
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Jack yeah unless
 
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
Mr Shea wants to cover this I can shed
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
some light in this this line would be
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
for software to be used by the Bureau of
 
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.750 align:start position:0%
for software to be used by the Bureau of
aeronautics

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
aeronautics
 
00:33:50.169 --> 00:33:50.179 align:start position:0%
uh at the Department of Transportation
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
to manage the grants that are given to
 
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
airports rather than money that would
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
actually be spent at the airport to
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
upgrade their software
 
00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:03.860 align:start position:0%
we have we have 25 airports in the state
 
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
some of them are federal eligible about
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
I think it's 12 are federal eligible and
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
13 are not uh the 13 that are not they
 
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
fund their own they fund their own
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
repairs they're typically smaller
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
smaller airports the federal eligible
 
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
we're on What's called the federal block
 
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
grant program which means that the
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation administers
 
00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
the federal funds that are flowing
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
through to the airports to do projects
 
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
and this software would help the Bureau
 
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
Chris did you have anything else to add
 
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:44.220 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh not to that specifically I just
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
um Circle back to the represent Mills
 
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
suggestion or comment
 
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
so if we do those three lines
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
um 45 through 47.
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
um I would suggest that you reduce maybe
 
00:35:04.609 --> 00:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
line 46 by 25
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
000 to fit into the repurpose
 
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
um what's left of that repurpose
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
appropriation if you do that you would
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
spend all about three thousand dollars
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
of the repurposed money
 
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
I'm receptive to that and I I believe
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
the department would be okay with that I
 
00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
think some of these are a little bit
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
scalable so that I think they would be
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
fine and they might be nodding hopefully
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
behind me okay and not giving me dirty
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
looks yes uh represent Faulkner and then
 
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.230 align:start position:0%
looks yes uh represent Faulkner and then
he

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
he
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
I remember the representatives Kaczynski
 
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
and Newton had concerns about money
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
being spent on Railroad lines owned by
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh Boston sand and gravel there's
 
00:35:46.609 --> 00:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
subsidiary Railroad
 
00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:50.339 align:start position:0%
could we describe what where this money
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
would go and is that different from in
 
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.470 align:start position:0%
would go and is that different from in
locations

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
locations
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
that were brought up by by the
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
representatives and
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
certainly I think we should explore
 
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.390 align:start position:0%
certainly I think we should explore
um

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:15.190 align:start position:0%
 
please

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
I believe what we're looking for is uh
 
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
some sort of explanation on
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
these three items on state-owned
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
45.647 do you have that before you sir I
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
do okay please I do thank you and
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
um just total Clarity
 
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
um this is beyond my area of expertise
 
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
um so I will answer based on the
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
material that that we have in the
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
documents be before us
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
um and specifically all three of these
 
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
items mentioned state-owned active
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
railroad line so they would be spent on
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
state-owned Rail lines not privately
 
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
owned Rail lines
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
and privately owned Airlines would be
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
like the scenic scenic
 
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.810 align:start position:0%
like the scenic scenic
component

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
component
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
is Boston sand and gravel and
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
um the other line operating or the the
 
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
um through ossipy those are still
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
state-owned rails rail beds am I correct
 
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
I would need to confirm that that's
 
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm not familiar with with which
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
Railways uh state-owned and which uh
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
privately owned I apologize okay
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
but the these items that are shown
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
um are are items of importance to your
 
00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:44.660 align:start position:0%
department I would certainly think
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes and I and I'm not in just
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
for my own point I'm I'm not opposed to
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
more care being done and hopefully
 
00:37:59.569 --> 00:37:59.579 align:start position:0%
before the fact than having an issue
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
with Freight
 
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
Channel 9 News yeah befalling our state
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
has happened in others so any further
 
00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:11.339 align:start position:0%
question absolutely yes representative
 
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
Jack uh thank you on that bulletin board
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
there there's a map of the all the Rail
 
00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:18.780 align:start position:0%
lines in the state and it clearly calls
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
out which our state-owned active
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
state-owned inactive and the other ones
 
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
that are privately owned and so you can
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
see on which uh miles of railroad These
 
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
funds would be expended
 
00:38:35.569 --> 00:38:35.579 align:start position:0%
thank you for that thank you further
 
00:38:35.579 --> 00:38:37.430 align:start position:0%
thank you for that thank you further
questions

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
yes representative yeah I just want to
 
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
apologize to Mr Shea because uh when I
 
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
originally came up with that I figure I
 
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
I failed to notice that the culverts
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
were at 550 000 so I thought I was well
 
00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.470 align:start position:0%
were at 550 000 so I thought I was well
under

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
that so thank you very much for catching
 
00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.970 align:start position:0%
that so thank you very much for catching
that

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:59.210 --> 00:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of what we charge
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
for fees or what reimbursements are or
 
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
use of the state-owned Rails
 
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
no I'm sorry in a further Ado so you
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any idea when they were
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
last updated or changed
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
when the ties were last updated and
 
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
changed what are the fees I do not no
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
could you possibly
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
um speak to the
 
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.430 align:start position:0%
um speak to the
Railroad

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
Railroad
 
00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
aeronautic your director and come back
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
with that absolutely absolutely so
 
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
um my position as assistant commissioner
 
00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
is responsible for the divisions of
 
00:39:43.609 --> 00:39:43.619 align:start position:0%
project development and operations
 
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
um assisting or Deputy Commissioner
 
00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
Brier who's been with us in the past is
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
um much more familiar with these areas
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
and of course commissioner cases as well
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
sounds good if it's possible for them to
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
get back to us today we'd sincerely
 
00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate it we will do that thank you
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
further questions just brief thank you
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner looking at the call
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
on these lines the culverts and the
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
bridges if those are not maintained
 
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.349 align:start position:0%
bridges if those are not maintained
properly

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
properly
 
00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:20.900 align:start position:0%
flooding could occur in the area around
 
00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:24.740 align:start position:0%
that line and certainly the bridge
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
uh there could be issues on the uh on a
 
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
roadway intersecting the railroad bridge
 
00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
or going you know going underneath it
 
00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.190 align:start position:0%
or going you know going underneath it
Etc

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.170 align:start position:0%
Etc
uh

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that this is part of
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
the importance too it's not just for the
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
rail line and maybe avoiding issues with
 
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
delays on the on the rail on those rail
 
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:48.020 align:start position:0%
systems or possibly possible derailments
 
00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:51.740 align:start position:0%
that these projects have additional
 
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:54.140 align:start position:0%
localized importance
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely true so keeping those
 
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
those bridges open is critical thank you
 
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.190 align:start position:0%
those bridges open is critical thank you
chairman

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
of course the new members that would be
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
uh would you believe question as opposed
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
to a question so
 
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh there have been some chairmen that
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
get very disturbed on those you have one
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
that is not so
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
so since we're doing Soapy's Choice yep
 
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.690 align:start position:0%
so since we're doing Soapy's Choice yep
um

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:31.619 align:start position:0%
I would like to go back to the Community
 
00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:34.220 align:start position:0%
College respiratory therapy program
 
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
the dollar Factor seems to sit quite
 
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
perfectly there the advantage point is
 
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
if you're doing
 
00:41:43.609 --> 00:41:43.619 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapy Physical Therapy
 
00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:46.700 align:start position:0%
anything along those lines it one
 
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
provides a
 
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
distinct increase in enrollment into the
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
institution which can also lead into
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
other classes at the institutions
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
but it's instant job placement I think a
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
majority of which usually stays within
 
00:42:04.609 --> 00:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and is an
 
00:42:08.089 --> 00:42:08.099 align:start position:0%
advantage to our entire Workforce tax
 
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
structure everything across the board
 
00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.089 align:start position:0%
structure everything across the board
the

00:42:11.089 --> 00:42:11.099 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
The Spill out to so many different areas
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
of running these programs in what the
 
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
students provide and do
 
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh is probably too numerous to count
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
here today but that would be my
 
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
suggestion for the
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
alleged surplus funds if we're going to
 
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
do a Sophie's Choice
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Jack
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I just point out for
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
discussion's sake that the committee has
 
00:42:43.089 --> 00:42:43.099 align:start position:0%
the option right now we're at
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
129.8 uh million of general fund bonding
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
the committee has the option to do both
 
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
and increase the general fund bonding by
 
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
whatever it takes to cover it that is a
 
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
that is a discussion we could have
 
00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.970 align:start position:0%
that is a discussion we could have
without

00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
suggesting whether that's a good or a
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
bad idea okay thank you representative
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
Mills uh thank you Mr chair I'd also
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
like to point out that we did put 1.5
 
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
million dollars already to CTE for that
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
program and they opted to put it into
 
00:43:17.569 --> 00:43:17.579 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance instead
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
I would be very amenable to taking
 
00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:23.099 align:start position:0%
another 1.5 million if the winner Squam
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
deal falls through as making that our
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
top priority but right now we've already
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
given CTE 1.5 million and they've opted
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
to put it to critical maintenance
 
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
instead of their Therapy Program
 
00:43:38.109 --> 00:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
Community College I'm sorry
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes I'm getting confused so anyway
 
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
um so I would opt to make that a
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
priority for the winter Squam money if
 
00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:50.339 align:start position:0%
it falls through and to still leave to
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
to try and distribute the excess money
 
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
appropriately in between all these
 
00:43:58.609 --> 00:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
different uh departments to leave the
 
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
1.5 million at
 
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
the excess at rail thank you
 
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.150 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
yes

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton Sophie's Choice
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's a good characteristic or Open Mic
 
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't know which one is better
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
I'd like to throw out for consideration
 
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
excuse me some money for the Department
 
00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:26.579 align:start position:0%
of Corrections for their planning for a
 
00:44:28.609 --> 00:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
new Men's prison
 
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
um I think I saw in the big book they
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
originally had they had 50 000 that got
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
it 40 was in there and and on our in the
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
blue book here when this came through
 
00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
2500 they are looking for which is a
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
a a pittance of what they will need
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately for planning but which
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
what kind of jumped out at me was some a
 
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
little bit of easy research last night
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
that was published through well blah
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
blah public radio did it and the article
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
was from 2019 in the broadcast and they
 
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
referenced a report from 2018 and this
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
is about the ceiling leaks in the prison
 
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
and I'll read the quote the ceiling in
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
fact has leaked for probably the past 10
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
to 15 years there are tarps installed to
 
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
divert the leaking water to collection
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
buckets reads reads the report from
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
September 2018. so where where I'm going
 
00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:35.180 align:start position:0%
with this is
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
we I don't think anybody disputes that a
 
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
new prison is needed in very casual
 
00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
conversations with
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
a few members from Finance I think
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
they're struggling with trying to find
 
00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
funding also and so it's a I mean it's a
 
00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
thing and then I remembered what
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
um honorable John Graham said the other
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
day that you do have room to go before
 
00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
that might have been from a roofer I'm
 
00:46:13.609 --> 00:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
not sure I
 
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
it so there's there's some money to go
 
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
to until you start really impacting the
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
bond limit but I also had read that if
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
you start getting a lawsuit that forces
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
you to legislate a new prison and fund
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
it no matter what you have to do that
 
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
affects your bond rating also so I see
 
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
this as a necessary thing to do thank
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh representative
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh I think we probably need some chats
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
down the hallway I had lunch with the
 
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
chair division one uh yesterday and my
 
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
understanding is they do have money in
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
the operating budget uh upwards of
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
around 10 million Mr Shea to deal with
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
us so it would 10 million bucks is going
 
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
to do a lot more than 2500 out of us
 
00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:06.770 align:start position:0%
to do a lot more than 2500 out of us
okay

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
um yes you can but I I would just before
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
we go there I have had similar
 
00:47:13.849 --> 00:47:13.859 align:start position:0%
conversations in that
 
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
um the the request from the governor was
 
00:47:19.849 --> 00:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars and when the finance
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
came in with uh a shortfall in the uh
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
the forecast
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
of they downgraded it to 10 million
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
dollars to start the process and get the
 
00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:35.339 align:start position:0%
planning in order and then it's going to
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
become a very big decision for the
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
legislature going forward where we're
 
00:47:41.809 --> 00:47:41.819 align:start position:0%
going to find that money we've done that
 
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
before you know it's it's a much bigger
 
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
number it needs to be done but I I feel
 
00:47:49.609 --> 00:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
satisfied at this point in time that
 
00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.670 align:start position:0%
 
tell

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
tell
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
please follow up
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't know what to say I've I've had
 
00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
conversations with different people than
 
00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
you have I I trust your people and I
 
00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
hope they do it thank you yeah
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
yeah if if it doesn't come if it somehow
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't it it's going to come it that
 
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
that money is going to come true whether
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's here or through the Senate and my
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
understanding is it's it's coming out of
 
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
this house proposal
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
let's have a let's have a discussion on
 
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
on the uh on this this
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
um monies and what we're going to
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
purpose uh these monies for
 
00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.050 align:start position:0%
purpose uh these monies for
um

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
and I would um and we're back to the
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
straw poll idea here if we need to just
 
00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
we need to go through this further we
 
00:48:55.859 --> 00:48:57.410 align:start position:0%
we need to go through this further we
will

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
um are you waiting to speak okay
 
00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
um and I will put forward first
 
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh represent Mills idea to uh use our
 
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
our Surplus that we have right now
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh for items 45 46 and 47 and one of
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
those I believe will be adjusted back by
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
was it twenty five thousand dollars
 
00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:26.420 align:start position:0%
which would essentially
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
take us out of a surplus on those lines
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
um and representative Mills follow-up
 
00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
item was that that we would put into the
 
00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
Community College as item number one
 
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at the possible uh
 
00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
funding that may come back if when a
 
00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
Squam doesn't uh doesn't
 
00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:52.140 align:start position:0%
um come to terms at their school board
 
00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
meeting that is our number one priority
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
so I guess if you're if you're in favor
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
of that you would raise your hands straw
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.050 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:22.460 align:start position:0%
no no
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
vote first okay so for for planning
 
00:50:27.119 --> 00:50:29.270 align:start position:0%
vote first okay so for for planning
purposes

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
um Chris if you could make that
 
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
adjustment for us
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
and let's let's turn the discussion now
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
over to in the in the event and I hope
 
00:50:40.609 --> 00:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
this doesn't come to be but in the event
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
that when a Squam doesn't pull forward
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
um we're looking at a number of 7
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
million six four nine six three three as
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
I have it and we are committing 150
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
000 of that to the Community College 1.5
 
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:04.370 align:start position:0%
000 of that to the Community College 1.5
million

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:05.579 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
what is the pleasure of the committee
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
yes represent Faulkner they suggest that
 
00:51:11.089 --> 00:51:11.099 align:start position:0%
since we're
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
taking it out of one
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
sort of educational program
 
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
that we in fact fully fund the critical
 
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
maintenance and the pulmonary program
 
00:51:24.049 --> 00:51:24.059 align:start position:0%
for community colleges
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
out of that um
 
00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:29.099 align:start position:0%
you know out of that contingency
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
so that would be an extra 1.9 million
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance and at one point
 
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
at second that five
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
uh representative Jack uh looking at the
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
the famous sheet here if if you were to
 
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
do lines 12 13 and there's a line 13 for
 
00:51:53.809 --> 00:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
it infrastructure upgrades uh so if we
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
were to fully fund uh lines 12 13 and 14
 
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
that would be in the spirit of
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
keeping it in education and that would
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that'll be 3.6 million over what
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
put aside
 
00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:28.990 align:start position:0%
put aside
yep

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
so Rose Empire's suggestion is to
 
00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
bring in the rest of it was at 3 million
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
425 we've funded 1.5 so the balance of
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
that you're suggesting to bring over
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's right in addition to the
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapy respiratory there we
 
00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
were we were putting that in so that's
 
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative Mr chair out
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
in keeping with our our this this entire
 
00:53:12.059 --> 00:53:13.730 align:start position:0%
in keeping with our our this this entire
committee's

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
committee's
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
soft spots I guess you call it besides
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
education I'd also go to the Natural
 
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
cultural resources department and then
 
00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
go ahead and fully fund
 
00:53:27.049 --> 00:53:27.059 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters Road
 
00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
repairs and pavings bumping that up from
 
00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
the what was it I think we put 500 500
 
00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:35.630 align:start position:0%
the what was it I think we put 500 500
000.

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
000.
 
00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:38.579 align:start position:0%
we could either put uh
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
we could fund them on that we could fund
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
that fully
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
so we're going to need to run some
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
numbers here
 
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
and can can we go backwards I just want
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
to go back to the community college
 
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:51.109 align:start position:0%
to go back to the community college
system

00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
are is would
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
represent foxman was your suggestion
 
00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
also to bring in I.T infrastructure I
 
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
hadn't suggest I suggested I didn't
 
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
think that was hard I think
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative Jack added that in when
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
you went through the numbers but
 
00:54:09.049 --> 00:54:09.059 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey just for the
 
00:54:11.089 --> 00:54:11.099 align:start position:0%
record when the department came in they
 
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
presented the I.T infrastructure and the
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance as a single
 
00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.339 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance request
 
00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
I took the detail of their request and
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
broke out the itps versus the critical
 
00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
what would be the roofs and other HVAC
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
and things like that to give you the two
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
separate numbers
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to be clear that when
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
they presented critical maintenance it
 
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
did include the it piece so yes
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to put in language so that
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
the comment system has the flexibility
 
00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
to spend it
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
where needed isn't that correct is that
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
whether it be critical maintenance or
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure you're saying if they hit
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
it as part of the same request that I
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
would say that it
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
they can decide how to
 
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
cook does everyone remember what the
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just suggesting that maybe we hold
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
that back and make that language and
 
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
then if we have it we'll bring it back
 
00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:36.109 align:start position:0%
then if we have it we'll bring it back
in

00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
if you would chin you could just go
 
00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:42.170 align:start position:0%
if you would chin you could just go
ahead

00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:42.180 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.390 align:start position:0%
ahead
oh

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
I I think I'll start and then if she
 
00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
needs to jump in I guess so the it
 
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
infrastructure upgrades included
 
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
Hardware upgrades to replace equipment
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
at end of life for 750 000 and then life
 
00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
cycle replacement of switches Network
 
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
gear and UPS
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
that was the detail that I had I don't
 
00:56:11.089 --> 00:56:11.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
and for someone that uh relies on the
 
00:56:16.609 --> 00:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
rest of my family for my uh
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
my advice on computers someone want to
 
00:56:21.049 --> 00:56:21.059 align:start position:0%
tell me what i t infrastructure is
 
00:56:21.059 --> 00:56:22.849 align:start position:0%
tell me what i t infrastructure is
please

00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
what what we mean by that Mr chairman
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
we have seven colleges within the
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
community college system of New
 
00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and all rely on a shared
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
Central kind of I.T
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure which is
 
00:56:38.569 --> 00:56:38.579 align:start position:0%
which is everything from the the
 
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
hardware you know the servers and the
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
blades and um and I am
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
kind of the narrative that that we put
 
00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
into our presentation here is about the
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
extent of my I.T knowledge to be honest
 
00:56:52.849 --> 00:56:52.859 align:start position:0%
but it's it's the
 
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:54.380 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
00:56:57.049 --> 00:56:57.059 align:start position:0%
what allows us to run our databases what
 
00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
allows us to run all of our Building
 
00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:01.140 align:start position:0%
Systems what allows us to deliver online
 
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
education all of that is is is supported
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
centrally by the community college
 
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
system and that is what this request
 
00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:09.790 align:start position:0%
system and that is what this request
um

00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:09.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.510 align:start position:0%
um
supports

00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
supports
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
if if our if we don't get to entirely
 
00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
funding that and our request was to come
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
through uh to make up the balance of
 
00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
item number 12 which was 3.425 which
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
we're already proposing half of that
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
then the college could make a decision
 
00:57:31.609 --> 00:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
on where they wanted to spend those
 
00:57:31.619 --> 00:57:32.630 align:start position:0%
on where they wanted to spend those
funds

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
yes and we would we would appreciate
 
00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
that flexibility
 
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
and the and the additional investment
 
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
that would um
 
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:41.829 align:start position:0%
that would um
be

00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
is that okay for now and then we'll
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
we'll see where we go yes representative
 
00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
a point of clarification on that when we
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
say they could use the money as they
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
will as far as it is under the
 
00:58:04.319 --> 00:58:05.809 align:start position:0%
will as far as it is under the
maintenance

00:58:05.809 --> 00:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
are just generally use it as needs the
 
00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
suggestion if I believe uh if I
 
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:16.140 align:start position:0%
understand correctly uh line 13 was
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
broken out of line 12. uh by Chris to uh
 
00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:23.220 align:start position:0%
to show the difference between those two
 
00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
and if we were to go down that road we
 
00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
would develop language that said the
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
monies could only be used for critical
 
00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:32.579 align:start position:0%
maintenance and or infrastructure
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
upgrades it thank you yeah we we've had
 
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
issues in the past when we've given too
 
00:58:40.609 --> 00:58:40.619 align:start position:0%
much carte blanche yes thank you thank
 
00:58:43.089 --> 00:58:43.099 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman in my view the it
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
upgrades especially to this common data
 
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
centers in my view is critical
 
00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
all right so why don't we let's put a
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
pencil to where we are right now and I'm
 
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd be are you there
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm suggesting
 
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
um that we are
 
00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.730 align:start position:0%
um that we are
um

00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:11.099 align:start position:0%
that we are funding potential funding
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
the respiratory program which was their
 
00:59:15.119 --> 00:59:16.910 align:start position:0%
the respiratory program which was their
item

00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
15 or excuse me 14 14.
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
that we are going to add another
 
00:59:26.809 --> 00:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
whatever the balance is from three
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
million four hundred twenty five
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
what else did we have which is that I
 
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:38.220 align:start position:0%
had Connecticut Lakes for a million
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
United Lakes yes to finish funding that
 
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
out to the original request
 
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
so that would bring you down to 3.2
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars left to appropriate from
 
00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
yes representative Jack uh there's an
 
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
item uh for under administrative
 
01:00:02.089 --> 01:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
Services number four uh for three
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
million dollars of Statewide parking lot
 
01:00:07.569 --> 01:00:07.579 align:start position:0%
repairs and Paving
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
that could be added as the last priority
 
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
scalable project I see where you are are
 
01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:20.339 align:start position:0%
there any other suggestions before we
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
yeah yes please represent me I'm always
 
01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
looking for return on investment in line
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
26 The Liquor Commission computer
 
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
software point of sale system
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
um they did do an upgrade uh I think
 
01:00:38.329 --> 01:00:38.339 align:start position:0%
four years ago and they did it on the
 
01:00:41.089 --> 01:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
cheap they had the bells and whistle
 
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
system laid out uh the point of sale
 
01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
system was actually going to be able to
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
push advertisements onto people's
 
01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
smartphones if they are within a certain
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
range of sales or different items going
 
01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
on it was also going to accelerate the
 
01:00:58.609 --> 01:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
way they
 
01:01:01.069 --> 01:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
um do the sales at the register and
 
01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:03.299 align:start position:0%
improve inventory
 
01:01:03.299 --> 01:01:06.289 align:start position:0%
improve inventory
um

01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.289 --> 01:01:09.299 align:start position:0%
alignments anyway that might give a
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
return on the investment versus
 
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
everything else but the parking is nice
 
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
to have but um isn't necessarily going
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
to do what you want Chris please uh that
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
would be fun with liquor funds so it
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't touch the CTE money that you're
 
01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
trying to Reaper not repurpose but have
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
your wish list for
 
01:01:27.599 --> 01:01:28.430 align:start position:0%
your wish list for
um

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure it's clear
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
that I'm not saying that your
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
suggestions not a valid suggestion to
 
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
the committee I just want to be clear
 
01:01:36.289 --> 01:01:36.299 align:start position:0%
that if the committee acts on that it's
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
not going to change the 3.2 million
 
01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:40.220 align:start position:0%
dollars that you're trying to
 
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
prioritize with a wish list do Chris do
 
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
you remember why because that's coming
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
through their their fund their dedicated
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
funds public Enterprise fund
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
yes so and did they say that they had
 
01:01:59.030 --> 01:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
the funds to uh already built into their
 
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
Debt Service and their operating budget
 
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
similar to what dot had done with the
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
projects they presented today
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't cost
 
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
there's no add to the operating budget
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
in addition to what they've been
 
01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
proposed to the governor and through the
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
house division so far
 
01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:18.299 align:start position:0%
so I we could we could bring that back
 
01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
in without Peril couldn't we but not in
 
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
in here that's correct okay let's do
 
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
that does anyone have any objection to
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
not doing that I'm I'm sorry that we
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
missed that before because I was
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
wondering yeah we had others
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
we still we have 3.2
 
01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.849 --> 01:02:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
right they would take so your suggestion
 
01:02:57.289 --> 01:02:57.299 align:start position:0%
right Faulkner would be to bring in that
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
the I.T money now at this point and
 
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
reduce it from that number for the
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:07.859 align:start position:0%
I haven't I haven't brought over that
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
well the part we yeah we start we're
 
01:03:21.069 --> 01:03:21.079 align:start position:0%
shopping on the parking lot repairs
 
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:24.059 align:start position:0%
but yeah okay
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry I'm missing the point
 
01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
I I I didn't know if we had disposed of
 
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
the question of whether we should
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh add money to the parking lot repairs
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
or whether that was still something that
 
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
we were discussing is using that 3.2
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
well we're just we're discussing it do
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
you wanna do you want to discuss that
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
point yes I just want to point out that
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
the parking lot repair uh Paving that
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
figure is scalable so we don't have to
 
01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
give them the entire three million
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
dollars we can we can find other things
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
that we can fund fully and then whatever
 
01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
is left if we'd like to or or that's a
 
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
poor way of putting it but we don't have
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
to give them the three the full three
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars for that
 
01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
red Faulkner well so I would suggest
 
01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
that we add two million dollars to the
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
parking lot repairs and then fully fund
 
01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:16.670 align:start position:0%
parking lot repairs and then fully fund
them

01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
Community College
 
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.930 align:start position:0%
Community College
okay

01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
um yes representative Newman
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
the question I just want to make sure I
 
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.849 align:start position:0%
the question I just want to make sure I
understand

01:04:27.849 --> 01:04:27.859 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
this discussion is talking about in the
 
01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
event that when a Squam does not go into
 
01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:44.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:04:46.859 --> 01:04:49.069 align:start position:0%
further discussion
yes

01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman at this time do you want
 
01:04:53.569 --> 01:04:53.579 align:start position:0%
to talk about the additional requests
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
from Geno
 
01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.910 align:start position:0%
from Geno
um

01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
it's all operating budget
 
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
I yeah I want to let's let's follow up
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
on that because I meant I meant to talk
 
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
about that so uh let's let's discuss
 
01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:13.619 align:start position:0%
that so Gino had reached out and um
 
01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and it noticed uh as of late
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
some of his projects were not included
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
in the governor's uh budget that he
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
thought were critical to his operation
 
01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
I reached out to the budget director
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
from the governor and and spoke to him
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
about that and this letter that was
 
01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
distributed to folks talking about the
 
01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
harbor dredging peer and maintenance
 
01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
fund established
 
01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:46.730 align:start position:0%
fund established
um

01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
I believe it's the impression that there
 
01:05:53.329 --> 01:05:53.339 align:start position:0%
are funds sufficient there under
 
01:05:53.339 --> 01:05:55.250 align:start position:0%
are funds sufficient there under
um

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:56.390 align:start position:0%
um
under

01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
um oversight by
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:09.299 align:start position:0%
so I I was I wasn't going to make any
 
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
motion to bring that forward unless you
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
but it is under operating funds
 
01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
and capital budget overview uh Mike is
 
01:06:22.329 --> 01:06:22.339 align:start position:0%
or Chris that's where that comes through
 
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
to use the peer maintenance money yes
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
yes they have the authority to come the
 
01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
capital budget overview with requests
 
01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:34.619 align:start position:0%
and you're having sat on and off and
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
there over the years it's always we're
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
always questioning how large that fund
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
is and what's being used and it's under
 
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
a regular uh
 
01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
it's under regular review and I to to
 
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
the times I've been on that board
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
committee there's always
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
it's always been permitted
 
01:06:58.730 --> 01:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
yes go right ahead uh thank you
 
01:06:58.740 --> 01:06:59.390 align:start position:0%
yes go right ahead uh thank you
um

01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:02.329 --> 01:07:02.339 align:start position:0%
it seems at different times we do uh we
 
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
do fun dredging
 
01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
like at the uh we we did in in Rye in in
 
01:07:07.619 --> 01:07:08.510 align:start position:0%
like at the uh we we did in in Rye in in
Hampton

01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
Hampton
 
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
so that I guess at times you know we do
 
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
that and also with the with the Turning
 
01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:16.130 align:start position:0%
that and also with the with the Turning
basin

01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
basin
 
01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:17.450 align:start position:0%
basin
um

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how big the their
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
dredging fund is uh finally we seem to
 
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
be dipping into it or asking for some
 
01:07:27.049 --> 01:07:27.059 align:start position:0%
help somehow but okay thank you yeah and
 
01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
it was also relayed that there are uh
 
01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.339 align:start position:0%
more Federal funding possibilities out
 
01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
there to help them with that project so
 
01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:36.289 align:start position:0%
there to help them with that project so
um

01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:36.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
there there wasn't a concern from the
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
governor's office that we didn't have
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
reps emails
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
okay I want to go over something out and
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
with Mr Shea's uh approval on this this
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
is what I've come up with if we go to
 
01:07:58.849 --> 01:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
their line item for respiratory therapy
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
and forget the titles just pay attention
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
to the dollar figures is 1.5 million
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
which we have already allocated to them
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
so their leftover needs are critical
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
maintenance and it infrastructure which
 
01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:19.090 align:start position:0%
maintenance and it infrastructure which
is

01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:19.100 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:22.739 align:start position:0%
4.625 million dollars in addition to
 
01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
that we've we've tentatively agreed to
 
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
put in a million towards the natural
 
01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
cultural resources Connecticut Lakes
 
01:08:32.339 --> 01:08:33.769 align:start position:0%
cultural resources Connecticut Lakes
headquarters

01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
headquarters
 
01:08:36.249 --> 01:08:36.259 align:start position:0%
for a total of
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
5.625 million dollars so that's where we
 
01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:42.299 align:start position:0%
are and we've also discussed parking lot
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
repairs giving them some money uh not a
 
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
dollar figure yet but at this point in
 
01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
time Mr Shea I've got
 
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
5.625 that we've come up with that's
 
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
correct thank you just wanted to be on
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
the same page at this point in time with
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
dollars and Liquor Commission is off the
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
table because that's an Enterprise
 
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
funding but we where are we able to
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
bring it we're able to bring it back in
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
definitely the committee can vote to do
 
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
that project it's not going to count
 
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
against your general fund
 
01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
um debt limit or it's or against the um
 
01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
repurposing or the CTE money if that
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
needs to happen yeah I would I would
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
want to bring that in yeah
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
so our our balance now is at what it's
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
you have just over 2 million and I think
 
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
represent Faulkner had said suggested
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
that you could use that Das scalable
 
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
money to make up the difference
 
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
if the committee had that desire but you
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
may have other options that you want to
 
01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:46.309 align:start position:0%
may have other options that you want to
consider

01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
what's the pleasure of the committee are
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
we are we amicable to
 
01:09:53.329 --> 01:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
putting the rest in representative
 
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
Cloutier yes a question again this is on
 
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
the wish list is that correct correct
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
correct and I just again I
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative could you repeat the
 
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
total figure that you reached I'm I'm
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
still trying to follow the debate here
 
01:10:08.770 --> 01:10:08.780 align:start position:0%
at this point we're at
 
01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
5.625 million dollars
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
five point two five points five five
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
million six hundred and twenty five
 
01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars okay and that would be
 
01:10:21.169 --> 01:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
on the wish list is that correct that's
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
the that's off of the wish list and this
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
is if when a Squam falls through on the
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
further discussion before I go to straw
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not trying to beat a dead horse
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to ask you again you are
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat confident that
 
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
some planning money for the uh for a new
 
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
prison will be available
 
01:10:59.090 --> 01:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
yes and I I had us I had a friend that
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
told me we can always beat a dead horse
 
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
so don't worry so and if if if this
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the vehicle if that money
 
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
had to be found anyway so you know
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
because I see that I had just seen the
 
01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
the requests that came through ours for
 
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
the 2 million thank you yeah my
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is we're perfectly fine
 
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.189 align:start position:0%
understanding is we're perfectly fine
there

01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify
 
01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.270 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify
um

01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:32.209 --> 01:11:32.219 align:start position:0%
if the winter Squam uh CTE project
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't get approved and it keeps saying
 
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
the floor is that the floor of the
 
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
legislature by Vote or is that the uh
 
01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
the ballot that's going forth locally
 
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
for them to approve the 10.2 million
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
to to approve their their uh portion of
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
that fund okay it um my understanding is
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
it lost by six or eight votes last time
 
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
and they've worked extremely hard uh
 
01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:02.540 align:start position:0%
trying to get consensus in the community
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
they've had almost uh I was told by the
 
01:12:06.719 --> 01:12:08.209 align:start position:0%
they've had almost uh I was told by the
director

01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:11.060 align:start position:0%
um they've been holding public uh
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
education on this and there's still
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
another one this week and the vote is on
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
the 27th so our wish list may be for
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
naught and it's our hope that that does
 
01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
become the case but if for some reason
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't here's where we want those
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
does that requires sixty percent vote of
 
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
the populace is that what they're
 
01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
looking for that's that's my
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
understanding those are often if
 
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
represent Jack thank you most of the
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
time that they will choose to fund that
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
with bonding which is a super majority I
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
would also point out that by the time
 
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
household 25 comes to the floor we they
 
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
will presumably have taken that vote so
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
we will know the answer
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh before it comes to the floor
 
01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
Chris and just to make sure that
 
01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
everybody understands the wish list that
 
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
you're putting forward wouldn't replace
 
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
the CTE project as passed by the house
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
what you're doing is you're letting the
 
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
Senate know when they get House Bill 25
 
01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
if the CTE project isn't approved
 
01:13:16.970 --> 01:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
locally that this is your priority this
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
is the house position that you'd want to
 
01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
take those funds and move them into
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
these wish list areas it doesn't bind
 
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
the Senate to do that in any way the
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
Senate would make its own choices but
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
when you came to a committee a
 
01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
conference you'd be able to point back
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
to this and say this was one of our
 
01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
highest priorities and this we let you
 
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
know that so can we negotiate around
 
01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
that versus not having anything in
 
01:13:38.219 --> 01:13:42.110 align:start position:0%
that versus not having anything in
writing

01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
so we've gone through a tentative wish
 
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.669 align:start position:0%
so we've gone through a tentative wish
list

01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:13:48.649 --> 01:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
um now that we're at that point I'd like
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
to Circle back to representative jacks
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
comment when we started
 
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
which is the state treasurer comes in
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
and gives you a number
 
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
that we try to backfill the state
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
treasurer by design by history everyone
 
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
we've ever had always does a low ball to
 
01:14:11.689 --> 01:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
feel excessively comfortable
 
01:14:15.169 --> 01:14:15.179 align:start position:0%
and this committee uh numerous times
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
over history
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
has decided that the priorities were
 
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
greater than what the number the state
 
01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
treasurer gave
 
01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
and if you took what we've approved so
 
01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
far minus the paving
 
01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:29.330 align:start position:0%
far minus the paving
um

01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
you're under a five percent I think of
 
01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
four percent something
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
increase over what the state treasurer
 
01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
gave you as a total and this committee
 
01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
could easily fund everything in that
 
01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
wish list and not do anything that would
 
01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
make anyone scream over the capital
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.430 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
in in my terms and I believe you've been
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
here the same or if not more
 
01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
um on other times we have we have stayed
 
01:15:19.450 --> 01:15:19.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
just for the committee's information if
 
01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
you look at the compare sheet that I
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
gave you earlier
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
and you're going to see a number of 129
 
01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:39.590 align:start position:0%
and you're going to see a number of 129
million

01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
that's where you're at right now the
 
01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
governor was at 129 million 875 637.
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
based on what I gave you the amendment
 
01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
this morning you were at 129 766-701
 
01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
so you're just slightly under what the
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed but to
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton's point if you were
 
01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:00.900 align:start position:0%
to add any of this wish list it would
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
take you over the 130 million dollar
 
01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.310 align:start position:0%
take you over the 130 million dollar
mark

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
mark
 
01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to put that out there
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
for the committee so you understand
 
01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
right and I and I I fully understand
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sure most of the committee
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
does on that and they to represent
 
01:16:21.649 --> 01:16:21.659 align:start position:0%
beaton's Point
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
um five seven million
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
um does not does not break the uh does
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
not get the the nerves
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
I I just
 
01:16:37.729 --> 01:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
my my only hesitation on this is that
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
there is so much that Finance is dealing
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
with and what they had to cut out that
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's I don't know whether it should be
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
us that makes that push or whether it's
 
01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
them and what that wish list is going to
 
01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
look like
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
um to make up for some of the shortfalls
 
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
that we have been talking about
 
01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.189 align:start position:0%
that we have been talking about
I

01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
I we looked at it back and forth how to
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
do this whether we would we would just
 
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh fund everything we wanted and then
 
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
put the uh the second Community uh or
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
the second Career Technical School off
 
01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:15.659 align:start position:0%
to the side and we decided we'd go this
 
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
way so
 
01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:18.350 align:start position:0%
way so
um

01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
let's let's finish up
 
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
um on the on where we are and then we're
 
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
going to come back to that okay and I'm
 
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
probably going to take a break for 10
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
minutes and then we'll come back to that
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
so what the pleasure the pleasure of the
 
01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
committee on uh the items which
 
01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
basically expends where we are
 
01:17:43.729 --> 01:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
in using the balance for um
 
01:17:43.739 --> 01:17:44.510 align:start position:0%
in using the balance for um
um

01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
parking lot parking lot
 
01:17:46.739 --> 01:17:48.010 align:start position:0%
parking lot parking lot
um

01:17:48.010 --> 01:17:48.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:51.169 --> 01:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
repairs and replacement
 
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
um which was the last item we spoke of
 
01:17:57.169 --> 01:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
um it if you're in favor of that and if
 
01:17:58.729 --> 01:17:58.739 align:start position:0%
you need more explanation we can do it
 
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
now but if you're in favor of that which
 
01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
essentially takes our balance to near
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so let's uh
 
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
so we're to that point if we could take
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh 10 minutes and then we will uh
 
01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:25.070 align:start position:0%
uh 10 minutes and then we will uh
continue

01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
watching anyone in the room
 
01:43:58.910 --> 01:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
all right let's let's come back from our
 
01:44:03.410 --> 01:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
extended break here
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
um for the some committee members I
 
01:44:07.609 --> 01:44:07.619 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're aware
 
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sure the gentleman won't have
 
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm hoping not uh representative
 
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
Connor on his way in on Wednesday had a
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
car accident and totaled his car
 
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
my last conversation with him was that
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
he was personally fine but that's that's
 
01:44:31.609 --> 01:44:31.619 align:start position:0%
why he hasn't been here and if you're
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
listening on the broadcast we wish you
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
best and if you can get back to me on
 
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
your health at this point
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:44:43.850 --> 01:44:43.860 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:44:48.169 --> 01:44:48.179 align:start position:0%
we started a conversation earlier by
 
01:44:48.179 --> 01:44:49.129 align:start position:0%
we started a conversation earlier by
um

01:44:49.129 --> 01:44:49.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
represent beggar about wanting to bring
 
01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:52.510 align:start position:0%
represent beggar about wanting to bring
in

01:44:52.510 --> 01:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
three Highway projects
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to turn the conversation
 
01:45:01.490 --> 01:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
over representative Edgar to tell you
 
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
what those projects are
 
01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
these are are Highway funds the
 
01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
department will speak to the point but
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
it won't affect our bonding ability on
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:45:15.239 --> 01:45:16.669 align:start position:0%
on the
uh-huh

01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
uh-huh
 
01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
on our total budget here they're needed
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
items and I don't see a problem with
 
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
bringing them in here uh it's sort of
 
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
like how we just discovered on the
 
01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission which of course is the
 
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
Enterprise fund that but it won't have
 
01:45:34.669 --> 01:45:34.679 align:start position:0%
an issue on us and I'd turn to
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
representative beggar to discuss that
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes the uh the items that I'd like to
 
01:45:45.410 --> 01:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
bring forth were
 
01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:47.699 align:start position:0%
three of the items at the transportation
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
department had had put in for but we
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
haven't considered yet they were not
 
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
um they were submitted to the governor
 
01:45:56.930 --> 01:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't of the ones that he had
 
01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:57.950 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't of the ones that he had
approved

01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
approved
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
and again I guess I want to emphasize
 
01:46:03.229 --> 01:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
that these are the highway funds
 
01:46:04.609 --> 01:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
um they're not coming out of the general
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
fund and they've already have it in in
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
their budget to handle the
 
01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
the costs
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
um the first one is the Statewide
 
01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
construct salt and
 
01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
sand sheds and uh we uh
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
we're familiar with the the request uh
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
for these over the years they're always
 
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
trying to to fix the ones that they have
 
01:46:30.109 --> 01:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
and they have so many of them that they
 
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
try to do so many every couple of years
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
um and that amount was for for two and a
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
half million
 
01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
um the second one was undergrad fuel
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
storage tank replacement
 
01:46:46.729 --> 01:46:46.739 align:start position:0%
um they have still have a a lot of
 
01:46:48.410 --> 01:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
underground storage tanks and they're
 
01:46:51.050 --> 01:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
going about replacing them uh you know
 
01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
before they have a problem they have a
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
regular schedule for it so I I believe
 
01:46:57.229 --> 01:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
we want to keep up uh doing that so that
 
01:46:59.090 --> 01:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
we we don't have a problem and it's a
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
lot more expensive if you do have a
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
problem with them and every place in
 
01:47:05.570 --> 01:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
them uh with uh you know the double wall
 
01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
tanks and they have monitor situate you
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
know stuff with them so we can actually
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
tell if it's a problem and I think and
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
again that was for two and a half
 
01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:14.030 align:start position:0%
again that was for two and a half
million

01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:47:16.850 --> 01:47:16.860 align:start position:0%
and the last one is for this Statewide
 
01:47:19.729 --> 01:47:19.739 align:start position:0%
crew quarters if you look at some of the
 
01:47:21.770 --> 01:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
pitches that they provided in the
 
01:47:24.169 --> 01:47:24.179 align:start position:0%
handout that they gave us
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
you know uh some of the places that they
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
have right now are ones that you know we
 
01:47:31.129 --> 01:47:31.139 align:start position:0%
might not want to sleep in a lot
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
um and they
 
01:47:34.910 --> 01:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
they have uh you know the situations
 
01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
that they you know the crews are working
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
overnight in these snowstorms and other
 
01:47:41.209 --> 01:47:41.219 align:start position:0%
times and they really have to stay there
 
01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
and so we have to just to try to make it
 
01:47:45.169 --> 01:47:45.179 align:start position:0%
better for the uh for the crew people
 
01:47:48.169 --> 01:47:48.179 align:start position:0%
that are working for us and uh and so
 
01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
that they can um you know be safer when
 
01:47:51.530 --> 01:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
they're out on the road and everything
 
01:47:54.410 --> 01:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
so uh they're continually trying to uh
 
01:47:56.450 --> 01:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
upgrade their crew quarters they have a
 
01:47:59.330 --> 01:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
lot to have a lot of work to do and they
 
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
have a request right now and for five
 
01:48:03.530 --> 01:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
million so that's a total of uh 10
 
01:48:05.870 --> 01:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars against the highway fund
 
01:48:09.050 --> 01:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
and I hope uh I hope the committee will
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
consider it
 
01:48:13.149 --> 01:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:16.729 --> 01:48:16.739 align:start position:0%
yes represent bogert
 
01:48:20.570 --> 01:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
would that be items 4950 and 51 that
 
01:48:22.010 --> 01:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
01:48:25.609 --> 01:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
because item 49 for the Salton sheds is
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh two million 17
 
01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
000 not
 
01:48:32.930 --> 01:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
2 million five hundred thousand
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going by their original request
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so if if the the latter the one that
 
01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned is is more
 
01:48:46.250 --> 01:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
appropriate then that's uh
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
um trying to go by what uh this
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
information this information I had not
 
01:48:51.890 --> 01:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
not this I probably should have gone by
 
01:48:53.209 --> 01:48:53.219 align:start position:0%
what you have right in front of you
 
01:48:54.770 --> 01:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
which is the uh
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
the list of uh additional agency
 
01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:59.410 align:start position:0%
the list of uh additional agency
requests

01:48:59.410 --> 01:48:59.420 align:start position:0%
requests
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
yes and that's and
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
represent I mean that's
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
um Edgar that is the numbers that you
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
just provided going off the additional
 
01:49:11.530 --> 01:49:11.540 align:start position:0%
agency requests
 
01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
I actually went off of the uh original
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
request uh sorry so uh if I if I could
 
01:49:22.669 --> 01:49:22.679 align:start position:0%
check with the the the department uh if
 
01:49:25.370 --> 01:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
which one is the one that you really
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:30.410 --> 01:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
represent most you want to say something
 
01:49:33.770 --> 01:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
for him yeah I believe what
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
representative Edgar was talking about
 
01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
was line 49 50 and 51. our figures are
 
01:49:44.649 --> 01:49:44.659 align:start position:0%
currently the requests are for 2 million
 
01:49:49.970 --> 01:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
17 500 for the salt and sand sheds
 
01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
I'm only going to say that once
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
the underground fuel tank replacement
 
01:49:56.209 --> 01:49:56.219 align:start position:0%
was two million dollars and the
 
01:49:58.609 --> 01:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
Statewide crew quarters was five million
 
01:50:01.729 --> 01:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
dollars for a total of nine million
 
01:50:04.729 --> 01:50:04.739 align:start position:0%
seventeen thousand five hundred dollars
 
01:50:06.649 --> 01:50:06.659 align:start position:0%
press right
 
01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
no that confirms what the agency
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
submitted and they're still okay with
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's in the book that they provided you
 
01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
when they came before you I know the
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
original request might have been
 
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
something different
 
01:50:20.450 --> 01:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
I could I could read the original
 
01:50:20.460 --> 01:50:22.090 align:start position:0%
I could I could read the original
question

01:50:22.090 --> 01:50:22.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:50:25.609 --> 01:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
that's fine um
 
01:50:28.669 --> 01:50:28.679 align:start position:0%
so my my question to you Chris is if we
 
01:50:31.490 --> 01:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
and we're about to straw poll this if we
 
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
bring these items in this 9 million plus
 
01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:36.649 align:start position:0%
bring these items in this 9 million plus
dollars

01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
um that does not affect our our bond
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
that we're going to pass out here under
 
01:50:43.729 --> 01:50:43.739 align:start position:0%
General funds it does not because the
 
01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
highway funds would pay that portion
 
01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:47.330 align:start position:0%
highway funds would pay that portion
okay

01:50:47.330 --> 01:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
and the agency has testified that
 
01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:50.570 align:start position:0%
and the agency has testified that
they've

01:50:50.570 --> 01:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
they've
 
01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:51.290 align:start position:0%
they've
um

01:50:51.290 --> 01:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
accounted for this these projects in
 
01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
their debt service line in their
 
01:50:57.530 --> 01:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
operating budget and to date that hasn't
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
been removed
 
01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:00.169 align:start position:0%
been removed
okay

01:51:00.169 --> 01:51:00.179 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
so that's that's fine I'd just like to
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
make one one on item 51 Statewide crew
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
quarters I had I had visited several
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
with uh executive counselor Kenny over
 
01:51:17.570 --> 01:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
the last couple three years and this
 
01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
item keeps coming up and life safety
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
issues and everything else and then for
 
01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
the crews that uh have to have no other
 
01:51:27.649 --> 01:51:27.659 align:start position:0%
choice because they don't know when it's
 
01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:29.699 align:start position:0%
going to stop snowing have to have a
 
01:51:31.570 --> 01:51:31.580 align:start position:0%
place to sleep
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
they'd been using wood stoves and things
 
01:51:37.149 --> 01:51:37.159 align:start position:0%
that they they can't use anymore
 
01:51:39.530 --> 01:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
we have hiring
 
01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
issues everywhere in the state but every
 
01:51:45.950 --> 01:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
every crew member that I ever spoke to
 
01:51:48.050 --> 01:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
always talked about the importance of
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
this so strongly support that the other
 
01:51:53.810 --> 01:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
two go without saying so if if you're in
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
favor of a straw poll batting four
 
01:52:01.490 --> 01:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
eyelines 49 50 and 51 off the additional
 
01:52:03.709 --> 01:52:03.719 align:start position:0%
agency request signify by raising your
 
01:52:03.719 --> 01:52:07.790 align:start position:0%
agency request signify by raising your
hand

01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
we show unanimous thank you I'd like to
 
01:52:13.970 --> 01:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
go back to representative Eaton perhaps
 
01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
you would like to uh we spoke about it
 
01:52:19.729 --> 01:52:19.739 align:start position:0%
and adding the one million five hundred
 
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the computer
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
software for the Liquor Commission but I
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
never brought that to a vote perhaps
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
you'd like to motion that
 
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'd moved the one million
 
01:52:33.410 --> 01:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
dollars for the point of sale system
 
01:52:36.290 --> 01:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
computer software under the Enterprise
 
01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:38.930 align:start position:0%
computer software under the Enterprise
funds

01:52:38.930 --> 01:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
one million five or one million yep
 
01:52:43.850 --> 01:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:52:46.729 --> 01:52:46.739 align:start position:0%
that would be line 26. okay 1 million
 
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand
 
01:52:51.169 --> 01:52:51.179 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor of that again that's
 
01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
in that's not you know that's a separate
 
01:52:56.689 --> 01:52:56.699 align:start position:0%
fund Enterprise fund uh signified by
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
and we show that we are unanimous in
 
01:53:04.490 --> 01:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
that and Mr chair before the
 
01:53:08.090 --> 01:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh folks leave uh
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
possible to ask one last question
 
01:53:10.199 --> 01:53:11.390 align:start position:0%
possible to ask one last question
please

01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:53:13.970 --> 01:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
missed Cass I know you're doing cleanup
 
01:53:15.770 --> 01:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
at this point but how is your team
 
01:53:18.649 --> 01:53:18.659 align:start position:0%
holding up and how did you survive the
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
Avalanche since I'm in an area where we
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.229 --> 01:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
Dave you can chime in so uh I think most
 
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
of the state did pretty pretty well
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
um by Tuesday Morning things were black
 
01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
and wet the Southwest area still had a
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
lot of trees down power lines down I
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
know they were still busy all day uh
 
01:53:41.209 --> 01:53:41.219 align:start position:0%
Tuesday cleaning up but I think they've
 
01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
you probably saw coming coming in today
 
01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
they've got on top of it
 
01:53:47.930 --> 01:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
um it was definitely a lot of uh it was
 
01:53:50.570 --> 01:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
it was it was a long couple of nights
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
and a lot of challenges over over there
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
with the amount of snow they had had
 
01:53:57.590 --> 01:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
gotten some of the traffic and truck
 
01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:59.030 align:start position:0%
gotten some of the traffic and truck
truck

01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
truck
 
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
knives and accidents and stuff but um
 
01:54:06.590 --> 01:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think they I think very very I
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
you know even with the amount of snow to
 
01:54:11.209 --> 01:54:11.219 align:start position:0%
have it have it have it turned around in
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
in a matter of a day uh I think they did
 
01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
an exemplary work keeping on top of
 
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
everything so
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
and your crews are doing okay they are
 
01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
yeah they're tired but I think they're
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
wrestling today and stuff Dave do you
 
01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
have any other more recent reports we
 
01:54:28.330 --> 01:54:28.340 align:start position:0%
talked to the district engineer Tuesday
 
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
morning and um you know they were still
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
out clearing up some of the trees down
 
01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:36.179 align:start position:0%
and wires down but I think people were
 
01:54:38.689 --> 01:54:38.699 align:start position:0%
um you know holding up anything more
 
01:54:43.490 --> 01:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
yeah no and Mr chair if you would concur
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
I would ask that on behalf of you and
 
01:54:48.290 --> 01:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
the committee that Mr Cass extends his
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
thanks and gratitude for a hard fight
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
for the last several days certainly
 
01:54:56.090 --> 01:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
great no I appreciate that I certainly
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
will be glad to have that recognition
 
01:55:00.649 --> 01:55:00.659 align:start position:0%
and perhaps you don't have the answer
 
01:55:02.689 --> 01:55:02.699 align:start position:0%
now that let's say it stops snowing
 
01:55:05.209 --> 01:55:05.219 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and we stop having ice events
 
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
how how are you and your winter
 
01:55:09.649 --> 01:55:09.659 align:start position:0%
maintenance budget overall
 
01:55:12.649 --> 01:55:12.659 align:start position:0%
we have a um item going for governor
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
Council uh next week for about another
 
01:55:18.169 --> 01:55:18.179 align:start position:0%
six million dollar transfer
 
01:55:21.649 --> 01:55:21.659 align:start position:0%
um we are over expended in some uh line
 
01:55:25.490 --> 01:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
items primarily salt and the um hired
 
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.970 --> 01:55:31.980 align:start position:0%
paying right now out of some other other
 
01:55:34.729 --> 01:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
lines until they can be back filled
 
01:55:34.739 --> 01:55:35.390 align:start position:0%
lines until they can be back filled
um

01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
we need to review typically Friday when
 
01:55:39.290 --> 01:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
we get the payroll and stuff we'll we'll
 
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
be making sure that that six million
 
01:55:43.490 --> 01:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
dollar uh transfer for winter
 
01:55:46.490 --> 01:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
maintenance is adequate to
 
01:55:49.010 --> 01:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
um with with the with the amount of
 
01:55:51.050 --> 01:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
expenditures from the last the last
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
storm but um
 
01:55:54.649 --> 01:55:54.659 align:start position:0%
yeah so we had
 
01:55:56.450 --> 01:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
about a month and a half ago had done a
 
01:55:58.850 --> 01:55:58.860 align:start position:0%
three and a half million dollar transfer
 
01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
and then it had a long week of storms
 
01:56:04.850 --> 01:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
the very end of February beginning of
 
01:56:07.310 --> 01:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
March and this past storm I had a lot of
 
01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:08.149 align:start position:0%
March and this past storm I had a lot of
uh

01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
time and overtime but um so we'll be
 
01:56:13.970 --> 01:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking at those numbers but uh
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
yeah okay excuse Mr chairman can I have
 
01:56:19.070 --> 01:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
one quick question thank you will this
 
01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
be from the general fund these transfers
 
01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
you've asked for now the transfers are
 
01:56:23.930 --> 01:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
from the highway fund Highway fund
 
01:56:25.370 --> 01:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
unrestricted from the highway fund
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
Surplus oh sir Highway fund Surplus
 
01:56:29.330 --> 01:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
turnpike I should say this this uh about
 
01:56:33.530 --> 01:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
a million dollars of that transfer is
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
also in in um
 
01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
relative to the turnpike system and
 
01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's out of the turnpike fund
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative Jewish but just brief
 
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman just briefly
 
01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:43.850 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman just briefly
commissioner

01:56:43.850 --> 01:56:43.860 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:56:45.890 --> 01:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
is there anything different about this
 
01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
year compared to last year is it the
 
01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:49.310 align:start position:0%
year compared to last year is it the
trees

01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
trees
 
01:56:53.209 --> 01:56:53.219 align:start position:0%
uh that in terms of asking for the storm
 
01:56:54.530 --> 01:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
is different what's different this year
 
01:56:56.090 --> 01:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
compared to last year and why some of
 
01:56:58.430 --> 01:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
the car is that inflation costs are up
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
so you know we had our our budget based
 
01:57:05.709 --> 01:57:05.719 align:start position:0%
on cost of of salt and stuff from from
 
01:57:08.169 --> 01:57:08.179 align:start position:0%
2000 and
 
01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
20 2021
 
01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
um we've seen a lot of material cost
 
01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:16.609 align:start position:0%
um we've seen a lot of material cost
escalation

01:57:16.609 --> 01:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
escalation
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
um that's a big part of driving some of
 
01:57:18.599 --> 01:57:19.729 align:start position:0%
um that's a big part of driving some of
the

01:57:19.729 --> 01:57:19.739 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:19.739 --> 01:57:21.350 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
with some of the you know fund funds
 
01:57:26.209 --> 01:57:26.219 align:start position:0%
requests so I think you know as as what
 
01:57:28.970 --> 01:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
as we're tracking we're seeing average
 
01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
winter or maybe slightly at more
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
um average usage uh but because the cost
 
01:57:38.689 --> 01:57:38.699 align:start position:0%
of the Commodities is is has increased
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
um we're seeing higher than average cost
 
01:57:44.330 --> 01:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you the best of the cruise thank
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you thanks Jim
 
01:57:50.030 --> 01:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you all right I think we can now
 
01:57:52.250 --> 01:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
excuse you thank you thank you for
 
01:57:59.689 --> 01:57:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.729 --> 01:58:01.739 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to
 
01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
um we're going to switch gears here a
 
01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:04.729 align:start position:0%
um we're going to switch gears here a
little

01:58:04.729 --> 01:58:04.739 align:start position:0%
little
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative brought up a
 
01:58:09.970 --> 01:58:09.980 align:start position:0%
conversation uh earlier
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
that we were we were presented by the
 
01:58:13.199 --> 01:58:14.870 align:start position:0%
that we were we were presented by the
treasurer

01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
um a number that has been very closely
 
01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
aligned with what we've been given in
 
01:58:25.129 --> 01:58:25.139 align:start position:0%
past years on our goal of what to spend
 
01:58:26.570 --> 01:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
which was
 
01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
a hundred and what was our Chris our
 
01:58:31.970 --> 01:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
number we were
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
so so when the treasurer comes before
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
you with their debt affordability study
 
01:58:39.229 --> 01:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
she does that at 120 million right now
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
the um decisions you've made or is it
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
129 million which is in line with what
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
the governor had done
 
01:58:47.570 --> 01:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
I believe you've heard from the
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
treasurer in the if not recently in the
 
01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
you have heard it in the past that
 
01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:53.330 align:start position:0%
you have heard it in the past that
um

01:58:53.330 --> 01:58:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:56.689 --> 01:58:56.699 align:start position:0%
going up above 130 by a few million
 
01:58:58.430 --> 01:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
dollars isn't necessarily going to
 
01:59:01.010 --> 01:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
change that debt affordability number by
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
very much it might be a couple tenths of
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
a point but it's not going to put it up
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the area where they would be
 
01:59:07.970 --> 01:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
concerned the other thing I would just
 
01:59:09.890 --> 01:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
note is that the decision on how much
 
01:59:12.649 --> 01:59:12.659 align:start position:0%
you bond is your decision the treasurer
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell you or limit that she just
 
01:59:17.930 --> 01:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
comes in and provides advice on what the
 
01:59:20.330 --> 01:59:20.340 align:start position:0%
impact might be
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh in in past
 
01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:25.010 align:start position:0%
thank you uh in in past
um

01:59:25.010 --> 01:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
Capital budgets coming out of here there
 
01:59:31.250 --> 01:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
have been several times that if if not
 
01:59:34.189 --> 01:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
more than that after we have listened to
 
01:59:37.330 --> 01:59:37.340 align:start position:0%
the budget requests from all the
 
01:59:40.370 --> 01:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
Departments and um
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
that we've come to a conclusion that it
 
01:59:45.169 --> 01:59:45.179 align:start position:0%
would be to the benefit of the state
 
01:59:48.410 --> 01:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
that we would uh we would we would go
 
01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
above that recommended threshold by the
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
treasurer it's ultimately our decision
 
01:59:57.770 --> 01:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
um what I'm going to propose is that
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
after all that hard work we had to find
 
02:00:03.530 --> 02:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
out where we would possibly spend seven
 
02:00:06.589 --> 02:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
million dollars is going to be my
 
02:00:08.990 --> 02:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation Now That We Roll those
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
out of the wish list and bring them into
 
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
the capital budget increasing our
 
02:00:17.649 --> 02:00:17.659 align:start position:0%
capital budget request by that seven
 
02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars there's more to that but
 
02:00:25.689 --> 02:00:25.699 align:start position:0%
and in the event
 
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
were not to be funded
 
02:00:32.089 --> 02:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
than our request then that bonding would
 
02:00:34.609 --> 02:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
drop by that that seven million dollar
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
also so the treasurer has said in the
 
02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:40.679 align:start position:0%
past if you move the needle five seven
 
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
even ten that's probably not an issue
 
02:00:46.070 --> 02:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
but when you start kicking out beyond
 
02:00:48.530 --> 02:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
that point and especially it's somewhere
 
02:00:51.470 --> 02:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
around the 20 million dollar figure that
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
it could cause concern
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:00:59.209 --> 02:00:59.219 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time uh is is there
 
02:01:01.490 --> 02:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
any discussion on talking about doing
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
that yes representative over please
 
02:01:08.089 --> 02:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
just a point of clarification for my
 
02:01:08.099 --> 02:01:09.649 align:start position:0%
just a point of clarification for my
understanding

02:01:09.649 --> 02:01:09.659 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
if when a Squam is accepted then we're
 
02:01:14.750 --> 02:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
looking at making the capital budget
 
02:01:18.169 --> 02:01:18.179 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars more to take into
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
account all the things we just discussed
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
and if when a Squam fails
 
02:01:28.370 --> 02:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
then that seven million dollars would
 
02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
come back from the capital and go back
 
02:01:35.810 --> 02:01:35.820 align:start position:0%
in as our uh projects that we wish to
 
02:01:37.310 --> 02:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
have no
 
02:01:39.649 --> 02:01:39.659 align:start position:0%
no what were what were what we're con
 
02:01:41.330 --> 02:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
planning and I'm sure Chris can say it
 
02:01:44.089 --> 02:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
more eloquently than I can we're taking
 
02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
our wish list that we just agonized over
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
and part of the Aggregates because they
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
are definite needs and they they fall in
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
the same priorities that we have always
 
02:01:55.970 --> 02:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
passed out of here instead of keeping
 
02:01:58.609 --> 02:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
that as a wish list on the side
 
02:02:01.609 --> 02:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
and letting other places decide whether
 
02:02:03.530 --> 02:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
they agree with our wish list or not
 
02:02:06.109 --> 02:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to move them over into the
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
capital budget and then in the event
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
that when a Squam was not funded then
 
02:02:14.689 --> 02:02:14.699 align:start position:0%
our total request would be reduced by
 
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars
 
02:02:20.810 --> 02:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
plus or minus plus am I correct
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
sort of I'm close you you are close so
 
02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
you would pass a budget that the Senate
 
02:02:28.370 --> 02:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
would need to remove that piece related
 
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
to the one escorm CTE
 
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
if they didn't do that then it would
 
02:02:34.129 --> 02:02:34.139 align:start position:0%
stay at the number that you passed that
 
02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
the house passed it at but I what I
 
02:02:38.810 --> 02:02:38.820 align:start position:0%
believe that the chair is suggesting is
 
02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
that if when a Squam doesn't the
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
communities that need to vote on that
 
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
don't get the numbers they need the
 
02:02:45.709 --> 02:02:45.719 align:start position:0%
Senate will likely take it out it
 
02:02:48.970 --> 02:02:48.980 align:start position:0%
becomes a kind of a non-discussed item
 
02:02:51.770 --> 02:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
but what leaves behind is all the things
 
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
that the house would like to have funded
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
and they are funded in your budget
 
02:02:58.250 --> 02:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
versus being on the wish list which is
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
that we hope you put it in for us but we
 
02:03:02.689 --> 02:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
didn't fund it ourselves
 
02:03:04.729 --> 02:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
so it
 
02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
maybe strengthens your debate when when
 
02:03:09.290 --> 02:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
it comes time to look at your capital
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
budget compared to what the Senate comes
 
02:03:12.530 --> 02:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
up with
 
02:03:14.689 --> 02:03:14.699 align:start position:0%
representative the good thing is that
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate doesn't take it out
 
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't get done because it's a
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
lack of local approval the money never
 
02:03:22.189 --> 02:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
gets spent and it gets
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
you know lapses and
 
02:03:27.290 --> 02:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
never never actually impacts the state
 
02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:28.310 align:start position:0%
never never actually impacts the state
budget

02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
I'd agree with that but I'd also back
 
02:03:32.930 --> 02:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
you up one step and that you'd go to a
 
02:03:34.250 --> 02:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
committee a conference and you would ask
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
to have it removed so it would it would
 
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
end up it would end
 
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
up being removed by the time you got
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:49.970 --> 02:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:50.930 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:03:50.930 --> 02:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:03:53.570 --> 02:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
I think we should do a straw poll that
 
02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:54.589 align:start position:0%
I think we should do a straw poll that
uh

02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:57.169 --> 02:03:57.179 align:start position:0%
if if you're in agreement of the
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
suggestion of bringing the items that we
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
had listed
 
02:04:05.089 --> 02:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
we're about seven million where were we
 
02:04:08.450 --> 02:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
Chris on that yeah so it'd be 7.625
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
million and just to remind the members
 
02:04:13.970 --> 02:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
it would be the respiratory lab for 1.5
 
02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:15.350 align:start position:0%
it would be the respiratory lab for 1.5
million

02:04:15.350 --> 02:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:04:17.089 --> 02:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
the balance of the critical maintenance
 
02:04:21.169 --> 02:04:21.179 align:start position:0%
for ccsnh for 1925 plus the I.T
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for ccs and H which is
 
02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:25.129 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for ccs and H which is
1.2

02:04:25.129 --> 02:04:25.139 align:start position:0%
1.2
 
02:04:26.689 --> 02:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
a million dollars for the Connecticut
 
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
lakes and then
 
02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:31.030 align:start position:0%
lakes and then
um

02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:33.530 --> 02:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
being the roads correct yeah the
 
02:04:34.609 --> 02:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
Connecticut like Paving the road
 
02:04:36.350 --> 02:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
projects so to add to the 500 that
 
02:04:41.689 --> 02:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
and that would get you the 7.625 million
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
all right should everyone understand
 
02:04:50.209 --> 02:04:50.219 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
that was line item 35 on the wish list
 
02:04:56.209 --> 02:04:56.219 align:start position:0%
we took it from a million five to a
 
02:04:56.219 --> 02:04:57.649 align:start position:0%
we took it from a million five to a
million

02:04:57.649 --> 02:04:57.659 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:05:00.109 --> 02:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
so on you no you're going to end up in a
 
02:05:02.089 --> 02:05:02.099 align:start position:0%
million five so right now in the
 
02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
amendment I handed out this morning you
 
02:05:05.570 --> 02:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
had five hundred thousand dollars in it
 
02:05:07.850 --> 02:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
your action today would bring it to
 
02:05:13.070 --> 02:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
all right everyone understands
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
straw poll if you're in favor of that
 
02:05:22.070 --> 02:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:30.649 --> 02:05:30.659 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the hard work that's been
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
done by this committee I think our
 
02:05:35.089 --> 02:05:35.099 align:start position:0%
position strong
 
02:05:37.790 --> 02:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
we will send it off to you Chris to form
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
you know work out the details
 
02:05:47.810 --> 02:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
so I will get a new Amendment drafted
 
02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
um and have it I'll email it to the
 
02:05:51.890 --> 02:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
members over the weekend hopefully
 
02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:52.850 align:start position:0%
members over the weekend hopefully
tonight

02:05:52.850 --> 02:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
02:05:56.270 --> 02:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
so before you start celebrating
 
02:05:57.709 --> 02:05:57.719 align:start position:0%
um so that you can see what will come
 
02:05:59.930 --> 02:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
I'll come in with hard copies on Monday
 
02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:00.890 align:start position:0%
I'll come in with hard copies on Monday
morning

02:06:00.890 --> 02:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:06:03.229 --> 02:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
you meet at 10 o'clock to do any further
 
02:06:05.089 --> 02:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
work that you might need to do and then
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
if there's any issues with the amendment
 
02:06:10.189 --> 02:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
let me know
 
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
and then at 11 o'clock I believe you
 
02:06:13.790 --> 02:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
have your exact session on House Bill
 
02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:16.250 align:start position:0%
have your exact session on House Bill
25.

02:06:16.250 --> 02:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
25.
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative Jack I have completed
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
reviewing the lamps extension section in
 
02:06:22.850 --> 02:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
the draft Amendment and I find it
 
02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:24.530 align:start position:0%
the draft Amendment and I find it
correct

02:06:24.530 --> 02:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:06:25.990 --> 02:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:29.930 --> 02:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
any other further questions
 
02:06:34.070 --> 02:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we will we will be back
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
here on Monday morning
 
02:06:38.209 --> 02:06:38.219 align:start position:0%
once again Monday morning at 10 right
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
correct for the work session and an 11
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
A.M for the executive session it's um I
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
know I know there's one one person or so
 
02:06:49.250 --> 02:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
that's told us that they can't be here
 
02:06:51.530 --> 02:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
um I would really hope that we can put
 
02:06:53.810 --> 02:06:53.820 align:start position:0%
as many bodies in our chairs that day
 
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
and uh so that we can have a unanimous
 
02:07:00.669 --> 02:07:00.679 align:start position:0%
yeah we are certainly looking for
 
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
unanimous and we will talk to that point
 
02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
when we when we meet next
 
02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:28.609 --> 02:07:28.619 align:start position:0%

moment

02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
moment
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
there there is there is one other
 
02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
important item that we need to take care
 
02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:35.109 align:start position:0%
important item that we need to take care
of

02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:07:42.589 --> 02:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh item number 18 Winnipesaukee River
 
02:07:49.010 --> 02:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
Basin upgrade we had discussed it and I
 
02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
thought we had taken a straw poll on it
 
02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:56.390 align:start position:0%
thought we had taken a straw poll on it
um

02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:59.870 --> 02:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
and uh this is this is the same
 
02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:00.709 align:start position:0%
and uh this is this is the same
um

02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:02.689 --> 02:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
Chris you want to take us through this
 
02:08:06.109 --> 02:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
item number 18 River Basin upgrade six
 
02:08:07.790 --> 02:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
million seven hundred fifty thousand
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
dollars so as the committee might recall
 
02:08:11.089 --> 02:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
02:08:13.689 --> 02:08:13.699 align:start position:0%
came in requesting this Capital project
 
02:08:16.729 --> 02:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
the department is um
 
02:08:19.129 --> 02:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
the body that oversees the Winnipesaukee
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
River Basin that serves I believe it's
 
02:08:23.330 --> 02:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
10 communities in The Lakes Region area
 
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me and those communities
 
02:08:29.089 --> 02:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
basically have all their waste come to a
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
central point which is the river
 
02:08:32.570 --> 02:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee River Basin and it's
 
02:08:35.089 --> 02:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
processed these 10 communities have a
 
02:08:38.689 --> 02:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
advisory committee that the Des works
 
02:08:40.189 --> 02:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
with and when they need to do Capital
 
02:08:42.649 --> 02:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
work or operational work they get
 
02:08:45.010 --> 02:08:45.020 align:start position:0%
approval from this advisory committee
 
02:08:48.770 --> 02:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
so the department is indicated the
 
02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
advisory committee is aware of and has
 
02:08:52.629 --> 02:08:52.639 align:start position:0%
agreed to the 6.7 million dollars in
 
02:08:55.609 --> 02:08:55.619 align:start position:0%
infrastructure improvements having to do
 
02:08:58.189 --> 02:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
with pumping stations and
 
02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
um lines getting to move the material
 
02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
you know getting those updated or fixed
 
02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:04.729 align:start position:0%
you know getting those updated or fixed
um

02:09:04.729 --> 02:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
so that that's essentially what it is
 
02:09:10.010 --> 02:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
the because it is other funds The Debt
 
02:09:12.770 --> 02:09:12.780 align:start position:0%
Service will be paid for by the fees
 
02:09:14.510 --> 02:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
that are collected from the communities
 
02:09:16.490 --> 02:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the use of the winter
 
02:09:16.500 --> 02:09:18.169 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the use of the winter
uh

02:09:18.169 --> 02:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.750 --> 02:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't impact the general fund
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
bonds that you would be issuing
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
representative yes I move that we put
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
this into the capital budget uh this
 
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
amount which is under uh it's not on the
 
02:09:40.850 --> 02:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
general fund I believe and the total is
 
02:09:43.310 --> 02:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
six million seven hundred fifty thousand
 
02:09:45.050 --> 02:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
seven hundred fifty thousand dollars
 
02:09:48.109 --> 02:09:48.119 align:start position:0%
winnosapi River Basin upgrade I moved we
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
put it in
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:09:54.890 --> 02:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
straw poll if you're in favor of that
 
02:09:56.930 --> 02:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
and I apologize I thought we'd put this
 
02:09:59.450 --> 02:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
in earlier
 
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh shows unanimous
 
02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
Chris is there anything else the
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
chairman might have forgot that we need
 
02:10:09.530 --> 02:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
to taken care of yeah
 
02:10:11.629 --> 02:10:11.639 align:start position:0%
no I think that addresses everything
 
02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
that you had mentioned to me
 
02:10:16.910 --> 02:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
to remind you of all right
 
02:10:20.510 --> 02:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you all right well uh we are we
