and reminders for folks one can our
 
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
representative weiler we have a little
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
rule in here when the phone goes off you
 
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
so what we have today is we have the
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
three bills and the the first bill on
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
the daca is going to be 11 31 and as a
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
reminder from folks that we know you've
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
you've come some very long distance to
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
get here and others have driven through
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
this snow which is not comfortable but
 
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
have something that's written we'd
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate that being provided to the
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
committee so the clerk doesn't have to
 
00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
go and take all these notes they can
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
reference your testimony
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
and that will say see attachment in the
 
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
record so that will become part of the
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
record also if there's items which are
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
being discussed
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
when we get really repetitive that's how
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
we end up with these hearings going two
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
three four five hours and we're hearing
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
the same thing over and over so try to
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know if you uh endorse something
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
that has previously been said stay that
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
and rather than having to go through it
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
all over again
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
that really helps us all and it helps
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
you to get out of here i know you don't
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%

mass requirements are being canceled
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
everywhere we need to protect the
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
students so that the mandates cannot be
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
declared in some future panic
 
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080 align:start position:0%

telling about the how it's making it
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
difficult for speech pathologists and
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
learning in general
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
well part of learning corrects while
 
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
private learning correct speech relies
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
on seeing the face especially the mouth
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
and the expression of the person speak
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
teaching speech
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
i also have a 29 page
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
slides from dr petty and he's come here
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
all the way from vermont
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
and he's he's going to speak to you as
 
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.430 align:start position:0%
and he's he's going to speak to you as
well

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
that the harm is done not only in health
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
but also in learning you'll find the
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
data there to prove the point
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
most important point i'd like to make is
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
the population that was subjected to
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
this unnecessary burden is the least
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
likely to incur infection due to
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
immunity systems at their maximum the
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
statistics also show zero mortality
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
among this young group
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
whoever made the mask mandate did not
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
pay attention to the infection
 
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.389 align:start position:0%
pay attention to the infection
statistics

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
we will like pandemic panic
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
so please pass this bill so that those
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
who make decisions on the management of
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
our schools will not be allowed to
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
impose this harm on our students

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.389 align:start position:0%
decisions relative to masking
requirements

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
additionally numerous courts have found
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
that masking requirements or protocols
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
are within the purview of local school
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
boards so as you can see there's some
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
legal arguments going on with this so
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
that's why this bill is still
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
very necessary there are schools
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
districts currently who are refusing to
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
drop their mandates as of yesterday
 
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.230 align:start position:0%
drop their mandates as of yesterday
um

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
and i just want to leave with it's it's
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
a basic tenet in our society
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
that we do not place burdens upon
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
children to protect adults
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
and this is a tenant that we have
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
severely lost sight of over the last two
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
years and as a result
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
we have damaged a generation emotionally
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
physically and psychologically
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
and uh we need to uh reverse course on
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
this um and we're gonna have an expert
 
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
here to discuss why this has all been
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
very illogical and unscientific and we
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
have done this to our children so i urge
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
you all to
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
otp this bill so that we can put the
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
nail in the coffin of these mandates
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
any questions representative hopson
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative blasic for being here
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i saw that memo from
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
the school board association i was
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could forward it to the
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
company i will thank you thank you
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative cordelli
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you representative
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
following up on a comment about children
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
protecting adults
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
i was reading an article
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
yesterday or the day before about a
 
00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:00.870 align:start position:0%
yesterday or the day before about a
study

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if you had seen it or maybe
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
someone else has the doctor um of eight
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
to ten year olds
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
and it said that they produce one
 
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.750 align:start position:0%
and it said that they produce one
quarter

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
of the number of um
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
viral particles yes
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
to go along with your statement that
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
children are
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
protecting adults
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
i wonder did you see that study and and
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
would you have any comments
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think i've seen that study in
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
particular but they've been studying uh
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
children and covet 19
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
there's been research since
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
spring 2020 showing that children are
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
not significant vectors of transmission
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
mostly children contract coping 19 from
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
adults not from other children
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
so and adults don't typically contract
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
it from other children as well because
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
yes they have lower viral loads
 
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.030 align:start position:0%
yes they have lower viral loads
yes

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
following on to that um one thing i was
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
always wondering about with the school
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
mask mandates
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
the mandates apply to the time the child
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
is in school
 
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
but the child is not in school for a
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
good portion of time as well and
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
i am sure that well i'm not sure but i
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
imagine most parents are not requiring
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
their children to wear masks
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
at home
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
or on weekends so i'm just wondering how
 
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.870 align:start position:0%
or on weekends so i'm just wondering how
effective

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
are school mask mandates
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um well there
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
are also studies to suggest that most of
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
transmission occurs in the household um
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know because obviously that's where
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
you spend the most amount of time with
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
other people it's prolonged exposure
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
that creates that kind of transmission
 
00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:48.710 align:start position:0%
that creates that kind of transmission
um

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
but uh yeah i'm not sure that we're
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
doing well there there is no research to
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
suggest that any place with the school
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
mass mandate had any uh correlation with
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
reduction in cases or transmission um
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
and community set in the community at
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
all so yes i
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that we have
 
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.470 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that we have
accomplished

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
accomplished
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
anything i think that this has been very
 
00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:13.829 align:start position:0%
anything i think that this has been very
theatrical

00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative hobson
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thanks again for
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
taking this question um can you tell me
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
where colleges and universities would
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
fit into this
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
um i believe that this bill is only
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
written for um
 
00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:28.790 align:start position:0%
written for um
k-12

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
k-12
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
um and it's currently written uh
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
for public and private um
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
i'm listen i'm looking to get something
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
across the finish line if if just making
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
it public would be okay with with me
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
certainly um
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
it could hypothetically be amended to
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
include public colleges and universities
 
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.230 align:start position:0%
include public colleges and universities
sure

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.949 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
committee

00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank
 
00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:57.670 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank
you

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
welcome to new hampshire
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and and i
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
came from south florida so it's a little
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
further than vermont okay so it's not
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
just vermont because i was wondering
 
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.710 align:start position:0%
just vermont because i was wondering
well

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:26.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
does everyone have the extensive
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
presentation not the the shorter one but
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay those are melissa those are the
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
ones which are on top of that the green
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
stack right there
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
if we have five maybe we can
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
one going that way one for the file for
 
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.150 align:start position:0%
one going that way one for the file for
you

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
ribs and cordelia and i will look at
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
and then we have
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
who has one
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
this is the one that's going to be my
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
testimony but i'm just going to touch on
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
about half of them
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
so you have all the information at hand
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
okay is there an electronic copy of this
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
that could be sent to us
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes okay great
 
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead um i wanted to thank uh
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
chairman rick ladd the committee melissa
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak especially
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
given it's snowy um i did grow up in the
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
mountains uh east of seattle so i
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to cover a little bit of
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
this material but the key high points
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
that i think are most relevant based on
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
the questions i've heard
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
by way of background my name is stephen
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
petty i've spent most of my career 45
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
years now believe it or not
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
involved in protecting the public health
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
and safety and worker health and safety
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
i've been named in 400 cases
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
to protect workers as a
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
exposure expert exposure control expert
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
and a pp expert
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
in fact i'm currently i've testified in
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
40 cases on the roundup on center
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
roundup litigation
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
i testified in kentucky in may to
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
against the mass mandate as a result of
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
my testimony the mandate was stricken
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
statewide so i won't go into any more
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
background about me there's a lot of
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
stuff here
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you can look me up
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
i do want to touch basically on the
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
field of industrial hygiene it sounds
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
like it's dentistry it's not we have way
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
too many physicians talking about
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
industrial hygiene which is the science
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
associated with anticipation recognition
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
evaluation control
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
of things that will make people sick
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
impair their health
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
and cause discomfort and even death
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
and so it's kind of like having your
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
heart search and do your dentistry they
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
both may be perfectly capable people but
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
you want one doing the job and not the
 
00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.510 align:start position:0%
you want one doing the job and not the
other

00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
and so when i'm in trial testimony we
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
have physicians talking about
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
a disease but i'm the exposure expert
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
and exposure control expert
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i've done that over 400 times named
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
the other point to be made is that
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
let's talk a little bit about why mass
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
cannot and do not work i mean believe me
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
if i thought mass could do any good
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
since my whole career has been
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
protecting the public and public safety
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
right there unfortunately it takes a
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
year out of the room for things that
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
would actually work
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
so i've got a plot here that shows the
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
cases in new hampshire over the last two
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
years and what you see is spikes in the
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
winter months
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
i've been involved in cases specifically
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
one in in michigan federal court on
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
masking where the
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
public health official said masking of
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
the greatest thing we have available to
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
stop cobit and i said well that's a joke
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
i said first of all if you look at the
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
cases in any state or any country
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
especially in the northern climates they
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
peak in the winter months and we in
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
industrial hygiene know why that is
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
because more people spend time indoors
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
and that contaminant concentrations are
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
always greatest indoors as opposed to
 
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.070 align:start position:0%
always greatest indoors as opposed to
outdoors

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
outdoors
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
and if in fact the masts are doing such
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
a great job you expect cases to drop
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
with time
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
you can look at plots as well from
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
almost any location where mass mandates
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
were put on and you see after you see
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
the cases actually rise they don't fall
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
so that that calls into question that
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
from from 100 000 feet
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
you can look at epidemiology work sort
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
of ground level stuff the best study out
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
there in a controlled study
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
despite what people say is a danish
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
study by vanguard where three thousand
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
people approximately were put in mass
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
and three thousand weren't and they
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
looked at increases in disease
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
and basically didn't find any
 
00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.630 align:start position:0%
and basically didn't find any
differences

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
differences
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
the only other study where you have a
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
control group that i'm aware of that we
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
can justify is a case
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh study by oster at all and
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
specifically they looked at children in
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
elementary schools it's the only study
 
00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:55.510 align:start position:0%
elementary schools it's the only study
i'm

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
aware of and it's here in my handouts
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
and they looked at masking of children
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
no masking of children masking of
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
teachers no masking and when you when
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
you look at the data in terms of disease
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
incidents they fall the lines within
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
statistical bands fall on top of one
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
another that means they didn't make a
 
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.029 align:start position:0%
another that means they didn't make a
difference

00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
i've been asked over and over again
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
about the cdc studies i testified a
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
month ago in michigan federal court and
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
i'd looked at all 50 every time i
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
criticized two or three of their studies
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
they had a few more the problem is when
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
you actually read the studies they
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
suffer from two major faults
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
one the studies don't have a control
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
group what do i mean by that if you're
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
going to say mask work then you better
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
have as equal a group as you can where
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
the masks aren't worn and then you look
 
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
at the differences
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
and if there's a difference
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
then you can make that argument but if
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
there isn't
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
you can't well if you don't have a
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
control group how can you say mass work
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
or don't work you can't say anything
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
the other thing is there's confounded
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
studies meaning that they do a whole
 
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
bunch of things at once change air
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
conditioning social distancing
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
quarantining masking and they say c
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
masking made a difference well how do
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
you carve out the masking component of
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
so to my knowledge there's only been two
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
or three studies where you actually look
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
at masks being worn and mass not being
 
00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.710 align:start position:0%
at masks being worn and mass not being
worn

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
worn
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
and those studies
 
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.590 align:start position:0%
and those studies
show

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
show
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
on an epidemiological side they don't
 
00:23:18.559 --> 00:23:20.070 align:start position:0%
on an epidemiological side they don't
work

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
now if you look at the micro level and i
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
have a slide in here i use all the time
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
and it's a cross section of the human
 
00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:25.830 align:start position:0%
and it's a cross section of the human
hair

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
hair
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
and then i have a little dot on there
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's 10 times the size of a covet
 
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.669 align:start position:0%
that's 10 times the size of a covet
particle

00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
particle
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
and what i say is that the
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
diameter of a coveted particle 0.1
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
microns is on the order of a thousand
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
times smaller
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
than the cross-section of human hair and
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
i ask each of you who wear masks
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
can you slip a human hair by the side of
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
your mask especially on either side of
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
your nose below your eyes
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
of course you can slip a lot of hairs by
 
00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:54.230 align:start position:0%
of course you can slip a lot of hairs by
there

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
and the cobot particle is a thousand
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
times smaller than that so it's like a
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
super freeway
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
you hear this argument about source
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
control it's garbage
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't care on the super freeway
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's going one direction or the
 
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.870 align:start position:0%
whether it's going one direction or the
other

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
if there's big the problem with mass is
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
you cannot seal them by definition if
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
they could be sealed they'd be called
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
respirators we can get into that as well
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
because there's some movement to n95s
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
but they're kind of the bottom of the
 
00:24:18.159 --> 00:24:19.029 align:start position:0%
but they're kind of the bottom of the
barrel

00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
barrel
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me as you're going through that
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
would you just tell us what page you're
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
on so we can follow along with you okay
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm now on um
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
i was on page 20.
 
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.830 align:start position:0%
i was on page 20.
i

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
apologize other thing i wanted to
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
let the committee know about is we hear
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
this argument constantly that droplets
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
are stopped by masks
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's such a false flag argument it's
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
like shining light over here when the
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
argument's over here
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
edwards and others
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
have shown that 99.9 of the particles
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
are actually what we call aerosols less
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
than 5 microns
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
so and the problem with with
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
this is i'm on page 21 moving to page
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
22. you can look at the settling rate
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
for example of droplets which are over 5
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
microns and they're on the order of
 
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.070 align:start position:0%
microns and they're on the order of
minutes

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
when you look at aerosols then moving to
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
page 23
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
the falling time isn't in terms of hours
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
or minutes it's in terms of days
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
so these aerosol parts and that's in
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
still air so if you stir the air up it
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
stays suspended even longer so the
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
problem you have these little tiny
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
particles is it's most of them
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of covid and they stay
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
suspended almost indefinitely
 
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.110 align:start position:0%
suspended almost indefinitely
so

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is that the
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
literature is clear that these small
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
particles reach deep into the lung and
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
that's what causes disease so the masks
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
don't provide a solution for that the
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
other thing is and i've said this in
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
many public testimonies the key is the
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
gaps around the masks
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
let's assume the mask is 100 effective
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
if you get anywhere from about up to two
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
percent of the area of the mask is a gap
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
you lose 75 percent of whatever
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
effectives it had if you get to three
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
percent it's zero effective
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
i i took my spirit airlines mask and i
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
actually did an experiment i had nine
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
percent gap area
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
um so it's the gaps and and uh
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
there's literature out there that says
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
you can
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
and i cite drew nick that says
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
mass can never be sealed especially when
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
four to eight hours of wearing these and
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
we all know that i mean it's just common
 
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.470 align:start position:0%
we all know that i mean it's just common
sense

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
so the real so the other thing i hear
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
once in a while and you should be aware
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
of this is well it does some good
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
from a public health and safety
 
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.230 align:start position:0%
from a public health and safety
standpoint

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
as an expert in that area
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
i would never recommend a solution that
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't protect the vast majority of
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
people and we in our industry have a
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
requirement that whatever solution we
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
offer should it offer at least a 90
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
relative risk reduction in other words
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
if i'm going to provide a solution that
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
protects people from asbestos exposure
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
and asbestosis
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
do i really want to protect one to 10
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
percent of the people and let the other
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
99 to 90 percent get asbestosis of
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
course not the public would be outraged
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
and in that analogy by the way the
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
asbestos particles on average are 50
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
times larger
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
than the cobit particle
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
and what do we do for asbestos workers
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
we use paprs with sealed asbestos suits
 
00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:36.870 align:start position:0%
we use paprs with sealed asbestos suits
so

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
there's no way if i was to put people in
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
mass for asbestos exposures i should
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
lose every credential i have
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
so don't get trapped by that argument
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
well it does one or two percent good
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't it's just not true
 
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
on um
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
page 30 i show the astm standard
 
00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.909 align:start position:0%
page 30 i show the astm standard
um

00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
that just came out on masking
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
and it says basically we have no
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
accuracy and no efficacy of
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
knowing whether they work or not but
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
when you look at these mass studies a
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
lot of them
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
they assume perfectly sealed mask and if
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
you see the photograph on page 30 it'll
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
look like that mask is glued to a sheet
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
of osb or plywood i don't think that's
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
how people wear their mask to have them
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
glued with super glue around their face
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
so even when you look at a can 95 in
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
their scenario under shaw
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
which is not a mask
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
the masks are around 10 percent
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
effective if they're perfectly sealed or
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
around zero if they're not
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
but the kn-95 is around 46 percent
 
00:28:36.159 --> 00:28:37.269 align:start position:0%
but the kn-95 is around 46 percent
effective

00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
with real gaps around 3.4 do we really
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
want to have
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
something that only helps people at that
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
level of course not from our standpoint
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
from exposure control we want
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
engineering controls of dilution
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
ventilation filtration and destruction
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
that's what i've been offering i've been
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
doing for two years and we've actually
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
implemented a number of schools and it
 
00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.549 align:start position:0%
implemented a number of schools and it
works

00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:00.149 align:start position:0%
works
um

00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
just to talk a little bit longer
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
we're starting to see some religion from
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
some of the public officials scott
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
gottlieb on
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
january 2nd
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
kind of spilled the beans on cloth masks
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
and he says it's not going to protect
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
you he was the former fda commissioner
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
he said a cloth mask is not going to
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
protect you from the virus quote unquote
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
and even cdc on the 14th
 
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.470 align:start position:0%
and even cdc on the 14th
said

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
you know we're not too keen on this mask
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
anymore maybe you ought to move to an
 
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.750 align:start position:0%
anymore maybe you ought to move to an
n95

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
n95
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
so we're told over and over again i've
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
heard this in court cases follow the cdc
 
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.430 align:start position:0%
heard this in court cases follow the cdc
guidance

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
why i say which guidance on masks i said
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
it was no mass early 2020 mass 2020 late
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
2020 no mass summer of 2021 mass fall of
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
2021 january 14th well we're not too
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
keen on masks in what world does the
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
science change 180 degrees
 
00:29:58.159 --> 00:29:59.190 align:start position:0%
science change 180 degrees
twice

00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
twice
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
in two years
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
no science i'm aware of and i was a
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
senior research scientist at the
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
all righty i want to talk just a little
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
bit about
 
00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.909 align:start position:0%
bit about
this

00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
quasi move from mass to n95s
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
be careful what you do as soon as you
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
move to a respirator
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
you have to follow the respiratory
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
protection standard it requires medical
 
00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:26.070 align:start position:0%
protection standard it requires medical
clearance

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
clearance
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
you can't wear facial hair
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
must have a fit test
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
must have an annual fit test must be
 
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.870 align:start position:0%
must have an annual fit test must be
trained

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
and what's even more disturbing is
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
and i wrote i wrote a letter to cdc
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
along with seven others last week
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
the guidance in the
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
n95s say quote unquote not for use with
 
00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:49.669 align:start position:0%
n95s say quote unquote not for use with
children

00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
yet cdc says you can use them for
 
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.909 align:start position:0%
yet cdc says you can use them for
children

00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's unconscionable
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
when the manufacturer says not and it
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
also says the manufacturer says
 
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.830 align:start position:0%
also says the manufacturer says
well

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
um you need to follow the respiratory
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
protection standard so there's some
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
argument that some people make well the
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
n95 only has to follow a respiratory
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
protection standard if it's an employee
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
employer relationship
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
and that's technically true
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
the problem is the manufacturer's
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
instructions say you've got to follow it
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
as well whether you're an employee or
 
00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.669 align:start position:0%
as well whether you're an employee or
not

00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
and god help the person if i'm on the
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
other side of the table that says oh we
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
ignored all that and we put our children
 
00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:28.310 align:start position:0%
ignored all that and we put our children
in

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.269 align:start position:0%
in
in

00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
in respirators and 95s without falling
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
respiratory protection standard and they
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
have some health effect as a result of
 
00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.549 align:start position:0%
have some health effect as a result of
that

00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
already damaged and harm to children i'm
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
going to skip ahead to that because
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's of concern to all of us
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to start on page 40
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
help me
 
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.389 align:start position:0%
help me
48

00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
48
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm just going to touch briefly on a
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
few studies because i want to get to
 
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.750 align:start position:0%
few studies because i want to get to
questions

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
there's a november 2021 um
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
i ready understanding student learning
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
study by curriculum associates
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
i've i've shown some of the data but if
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
you moved page 49
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
for grades 1
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
through tw um
 
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.470 align:start position:0%
through tw um
eight

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%

00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
one year twenty to twenty twenty one
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
reading result outcomes
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
have dropped
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
up to nine percent
 
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.710 align:start position:0%
up to nine percent
math

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
math
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
scores have dropped 4 to 10
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
depending on the grade
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
if you move all the way to page
 
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.470 align:start position:0%
if you move all the way to page
51

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
51
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
the outcomes are even worse for
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
minorities blacks students that have
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
predominant black populations latino
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
where the
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
degradation and outcomes is anywhere
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps an even more disturbing study is
 
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.710 align:start position:0%
perhaps an even more disturbing study is
this

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
recent brown university study and i'm
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
going to move you all the way to page
 
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.750 align:start position:0%
going to move you all the way to page
54.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
54.
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
for children born during the pandemic in
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
other words somewhere between zero and
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
one and two years old
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
they're early learning composite or
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
various things like number of words they
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
can speak et cetera at a certain age
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
their composite score in two years is
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
down 23 percent
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing enormous damage to the
 
00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.990 align:start position:0%
we're doing enormous damage to the
children

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
and so what did cdc do on february 8th
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
and that was one of the reasons for my
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
letter to them
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
they moved the goal post
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
they changed learning outcomes so that
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
outcomes that would be done by say age
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
24 months or now 30
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
months so rather than admitting the harm
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
done they move the goal post
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
those goal posts have been in place for
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
18 years by the way
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
pretty disturbing actually
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
same study when they looked at
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
non-verbal and verbal development of
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
young people
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
there's a chart on page 55. i won't go
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
into it but there's a precipitous fall
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
off from 20 to 2022. it's very
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
disturbing both on verbal development
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
and non-verbal development
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
there was also a january 22
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
2022 study by the department of
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
education of england
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm on now for you that are
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
following or trying to follow me
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.069 align:start position:0%
on page
57

00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
the teacher said that 94
 
00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:26.389 align:start position:0%
the teacher said that 94
of

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:27.750 align:start position:0%
of
the

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
leaders said that wearing face coverings
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
made communication more difficult and 59
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
said it made it a lot more difficult
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
by the way england has recently dropped
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
all these mandates
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
and last but not least i'll cite some
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
work by keselinski and co-authors from
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
2021 it begins on page 59
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
they looked at 1226 studies on the
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
effects of face masking
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
distilled it down to 109 qualitative and
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
44 quantitative
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
and on page 61 you can see 25 harms done
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
by mass including
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
harms done to children both physical and
 
00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.750 align:start position:0%
harms done to children both physical and
emotional

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
emotional
 
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.950 align:start position:0%
emotional
so

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
i i ask you do we really want to put
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
children and adults in mass the answer
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
of course is no
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
i've provided to you in this long
 
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.790 align:start position:0%
i've provided to you in this long
handout

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
handout
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
the whole list of engineering controls
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
we live in what we call the hierarchy of
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
controls when we try to control hazards
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
to people and what that is is it was
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
developed by the national safety council
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
in 1950
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
not exactly
 
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.950 align:start position:0%
not exactly
recently

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
and what it says is you you look at
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
things that are most effective the least
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
effective and remember i said
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
engineering controls are the most
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
effective ppe or met or respirators is
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
least effective because we know people
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
won't wear it properly over long periods
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
of time based on decades of experience
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
and masks do not fit within the
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
hierarchy at all
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
so the solution has always been
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
dilution ventilation
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
filtration and engineering controls like
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
say the new calgon highway which for 400
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
bucks plus installation covers 6 000
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
square feet
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
can get rid of about 90 to 90 percent 95
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
percent of the viruses including mold
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
and bacteria per pass
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
we implemented that technology in a
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
special needs high school in the fall of
 
00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.710 align:start position:0%
special needs high school in the fall of
2020

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
and we had virtually no cases we've had
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
some with two or three we think those
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
were brought in
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
with that i know i've been quick i
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
apologize but there's a lot of material
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
here uh we'll make it all available to
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
you electronically and i appreciate the
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to you and would
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
take any questions if there's time thank
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
you very much doctor are there any
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
questions for dr petty reversing waltz
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman dr petty
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
i agree with you that it can be
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
problematic when studies take multiple
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
factors in
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
um and then draw a conclusion when
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
there's really multiple variables there
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if you're familiar
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
with the study by stamford and yell out
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
of bangladesh at dealing with masks i am
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
so that was a single factor study as i
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
recall the only difference between those
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
villages was masquerading and unmasking
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
isn't that correct
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's not actually
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's stated that way but i think you'll
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
find there and i can give you at least
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
four or five analysis that say the state
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
study is fatally flawed there's there's
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
two areas one there's there's really
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
not well established control non-control
 
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.589 align:start position:0%
not well established control non-control
group

00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
the only way they really knew people
 
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
were wearing them or not is they had
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
people standing on corners essentially
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
like policemen make trying to make sure
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
they wore them and they were also
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
compensating people to wear them
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
that's not typically done the other
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
thing is they didn't really know who had
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
disease and who didn't because they
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have a line in the sand
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
as to when that sterile presence in the
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
blood actually occurred
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
so there's enormous criticisms of that
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
study in the literature right now
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
in fact most
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
i would say most epidemiologists
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
and i can hand you three or four
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
articles that say that
 
00:37:59.119 --> 00:37:59.910 align:start position:0%
articles that say that
are

00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
really against that study
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
so you're suggesting that some of our
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
top scientists there
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
didn't come up with an honest study
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying anything about their
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
honesty i'm saying and i'm not i don't
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
even know if i agree with you that
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
they're top scientists the people
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
actually doing the work i don't think
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
they're top scientists
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
there are some people here in the united
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
states that looked at that work and
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
published on it but when you bore into
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
the data you find it's got serious flaws
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
so i have another question for you would
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
you agree with me that correlation is
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
not causation
 
00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.589 align:start position:0%
not causation
um

00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a yes or no answer
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
the difference the difference is you're
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
looking at epidemiology versus
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
industrial hygiene
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're in the world of erring on the side
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
of public health and safety by that i
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
mean though
 
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.470 align:start position:0%
mean though
um

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
if we see
 
00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.109 align:start position:0%
if we see
trends

00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
trends
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
because remember i said the definition
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
of industrial hygiene is anticipation
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
recognition evaluation and control
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
then we will take some actions to try to
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
protect the public but those actions
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
the ability to protect the vast majority
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
of people not a minority of people the
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
issue of uh
 
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.150 align:start position:0%
issue of uh
correlation

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
correlation
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
versus causation is very complex
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
and it's really beyond the ability to
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
deal with that in a short time sure but
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's not there's not a simple tie that
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
correlation is not always causation you
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
can have correlation and in fact there's
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
no causation relationship is that not
 
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.349 align:start position:0%
no causation relationship is that not
correct

00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
you give me a specific example answered
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
i i i think that sometimes sometimes you
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
can have correlation and there's no
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
relationship to causation
 
00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.270 align:start position:0%
relationship to causation
uh

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
are you telling me correlation is always
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
causation i'm not saying we need to make
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
it a question we're gonna get there well
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
in what context i mean i can i
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
probably 500 studies on benzene related
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
to leukemia
 
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.109 align:start position:0%
to leukemia
so

00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's both correlation and causation
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
but here's the problem what you're
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
headed towards is is this idealistic
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
assumption that
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
you do you don't do anything or you
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
don't do the proper things unless you
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
have causation that's not how we operate
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
and you'll say okay well we wore mass to
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
do that no mass never had a chance of
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
being a solution to this problem you're
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
anticipating the wrong question so
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
you're ducking this because you're
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
anticipating the wrong question where
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going with this is you started
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
talking about masking and you started
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
talking about the drop and the
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
performance of our kids in schools
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
and i would maintain the correlation
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's a correlation there when kids
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
were master they dropped
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
but i think this the reason kids
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
performance dropped is not because they
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
were marrying masks there are so many
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
things that have happened under covid
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
and that it's not just masking it's the
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
stress on the kids it's the remote
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
learning it's time at home it's time
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
away from the classroom it's just
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
you know you any element early
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
elementary teacher right now will tell
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
you that the kids are unusually needy
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
and they're not performing like they
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
used to and they particularly the early
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
grades k12 have never known
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
um a normal school year and so you came
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
in and testified that
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
these kids were masked and all of a
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
sudden all their performances dropped
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
and they were you testified as if there
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
was a correlation there we need it
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm suggesting so the
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
question is would you agree that there's
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
not a direct correlation between math
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
squaring and student performance
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
no i wouldn't agree with that at all
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
there are there are multiple factors in
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
some of the studies and some of the
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
studies are cider masking only there's
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
no doubt that masking it has an impact
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
on on learning i cited the english
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
department of education study which is
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
purely masking
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
so how can you say that
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not going to go any this
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
is not i'm not in the courtroom here
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
but i'm just going to say one final
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
question if i may and that is how can
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
you say that there was one factor there
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
when we all know there were so many
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
factors going on during covid
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
how can i say that there's no there's no
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
doubt and there's no doubt based on the
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
evidence that masking is like there are
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
other factors as well i've not said that
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
but masking you cannot deny that masking
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
is one of those factors
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
you just made thank you
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
from the committee i want to remind the
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh public that's coming in that we do
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
have an overflow room across the hallway
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
where it's being streamed
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
and for those that are we and we do have
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
a limit capacity in this room so that's
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
set by the fire marshal so that's not us
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
setting that limit and we're getting
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
close to it
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
so if if in fact we get many more in
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
maybe perhaps after some have testified
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
you could go across and listen and give
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.430 align:start position:0%
further questions
rep

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
rep
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
i have heard that in that study that you
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
quoted that mega stud or over study
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
where they took all of those studies and
 
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.109 align:start position:0%
where they took all of those studies and
then

00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
picked uh you know narrowed it down to a
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
certain number i have heard people say
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
that well yeah they were just
 
00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.790 align:start position:0%
that well yeah they were just
cherry-picking

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
cherry-picking
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
the ones that had the results they
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
wanted so what can you tell us about
 
00:43:44.079 --> 00:43:45.589 align:start position:0%
wanted so what can you tell us about
that

00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
well i think when you look at
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
epidemiology meta studies are on the top
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
of the pyramid right
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
by definition so that's a meta study so
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's always the argument made
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
that that for somebody doesn't agree
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
with the outcome
 
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.030 align:start position:0%
with the outcome
and

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know the question i always ask him
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
is what what specifically was cherry
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
picked because i don't believe that's
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
the case i think they were they were
 
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
they were honest in the paper about what
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative hopson
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
being here i appreciate it um i have a
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
question for you bring it down a couple
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
of notches i'm not going to get into you
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
know studies and things but can you tell
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
me the cdc it
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
i was i wasn't following you um after
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
your discussion of masks and the changes
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
back and forth but what are the current
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations right now
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.319 --> 00:44:47.670 align:start position:0%
 
change

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
in whether or not they were closely
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
fitted or not closely fitted can you
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
can you bring that back to
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
to current thank you yeah
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
i'll quote you the language it's on
 
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
they say loosely woven cloth products
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
provide the least protection
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
and then they say
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
niosh approve respirators
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
which is interesting then they say
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
including n95s because respirators can
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
go all the way to scbas right i mean
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
they can go to scott air packs the
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
firemen things
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
offer the highest level of protection
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
this is tacit admission that the cloth
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.839 --> 00:45:32.630 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
so that is the current
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation right now
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
the the current recommendation is to
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
move towards n95s yes
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
the problem with that of course is
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
that when you when you look at further
 
00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:49.109 align:start position:0%
that when you when you look at further
guidance

00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
it it's it says they can be used on
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
children and then they provide links to
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers at 3m
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
moldex others

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
the paperwork says not for use with
 
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.150 align:start position:0%
the paperwork says not for use with
children

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's what's so
 
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.589 align:start position:0%
that's what's so
disturbing

00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
disturbing
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
further question representative
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you miss sharon thank you dr petty

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as i you're well aware
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
there's a phase out that we're going
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
through right now in terms of new
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
guidance if you will from from the state
 
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.349 align:start position:0%
guidance if you will from from the state
however

00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
as i understand the school buses are
 
00:46:37.839 --> 00:46:39.510 align:start position:0%
as i understand the school buses are
not

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
under federal
 
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.550 align:start position:0%
under federal
jurisdiction

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
federal travel so my understanding is
 
00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:45.750 align:start position:0%
federal travel so my understanding is
that

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
kids on school buses will still have to
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
wear masks even if the school districts
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
drop their mask mandates my question is
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
given your background in all your
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
travels and your connections do you have
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
any sense if the feds will let the
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
my sense is that they're going to lag
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
because the whole reason and we we know
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
from from actual documents
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
that the reason cdc went from no mass to
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
mass in the fall of 2021
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
was pressure from the teachers union
 
00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.630 align:start position:0%
was pressure from the teachers union
um

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
that's just a statement of fact
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
um so there are political things driving
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
this i've always said this isn't a
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
science issue this is a political issue
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
the the reason i think it's important
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
that the legislature and i've been
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
talking to a lot of groups
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
put something in place like this is
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to have this scenario where
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
the next time there's some
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
incident that they believe is important
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
politically then they'll just just like
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
they did in the fall of 2021 they'll
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
slap the mass thing on again
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
i i think that uh that it needs to
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
follow the science
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
the actual science and um
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
and then if we're gonna if we're gonna
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
do something like that
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
especially if you look at the guidance
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
from who the world health organization
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
they say for children in order to
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
put masks or anything on children you
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
have to do a
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
risk analysis meaning what are the
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
benefits minus what are the costs or
 
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.030 align:start position:0%
benefits minus what are the costs or
liabilities

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
liabilities
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
the costs in terms of learning
 
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.589 align:start position:0%
the costs in terms of learning
emotional

00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
emotional
 
00:48:27.599 --> 00:48:28.710 align:start position:0%
emotional
development

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
development
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
physical harm
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
those have never been compared to
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
at cdc or anywhere else
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
the benefits which i think the benefits
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
are almost zero
 
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.390 align:start position:0%
are almost zero
so

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
that the thing that's important is that
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
we get back to the science and the
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
legislature not let people simply
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
mandate things that don't have real
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
signs behind them
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to be about education
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
i've talked to a lawyer who has
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
testified federally
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
for a number of years about
 
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.270 align:start position:0%
for a number of years about
immunizations

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
and is very interested in this topic and
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
it seems that all the schools that have
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
imposed mask mandates are relying on cdc
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
guidance or similar
 
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:14.829 align:start position:0%
guidance or similar
health

00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:49:14.839 --> 00:49:16.630 align:start position:0%
health
recommendations

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
but this lawyer points out that they
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
have ignored
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
education impact
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
which is their primary function
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
so i was interested in seeing some of
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
the studies you have here but
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
i think the point is that
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
protecting health is certainly
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
a responsibility but also education and
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
you have to look at the education impact
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
of mandates such as this
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
do you have any
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely the
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
as i said i've cited in this
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
presentation and others
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
the world health organization's unicef's
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
position on masking and children
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
and they all say that you need to do
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
this this i'll call it risk assessment
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
or cost benefit analysis before you do
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
it in fact their primary
 
00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
mantra is do no harm
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
and the harms
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
are not accounted for in the united
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
states yet in any formal analysis that
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of so i absolutely agree with
 
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.750 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of so i absolutely agree with
you

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
represent luno
 
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh mr petty for uh
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
being here with us this morning um i was
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
just um uh uh interested to learn a
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
little bit more about um
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
your um uh the work that you do
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
providing uh expert opinions
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh as part of your uh your professional
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
career and um you're not wearing an
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
orange badge in that in new hampshire
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
that means that um when you're wearing
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
an orange badge badge somebody has uh
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
has paid for you to
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
to provide testimony i was wondering if
 
00:50:59.359 --> 00:51:00.790 align:start position:0%
to provide testimony i was wondering if
anybody

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.589 align:start position:0%
anybody
is

00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
is compensating you for your travel and
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
testimony here this morning and who that
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.119 --> 00:51:12.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
i would say of the several
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
thousand people that i've helped i've
 
00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:18.630 align:start position:0%
thousand people that i've helped i've
taken

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
taken
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
to this point i've taken no compensation
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
i figure i've donated almost a half a
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
nebraska they paid my airfare and they
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
paid a hotel for the night that i had to
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
stay over in this case
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
i'm paying for everything but i have
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
there has been some crowdsourcing that
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
has donated some money to help with the
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
airfare because my first flight got
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
cancelled and i had to pay for a very
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
expensive second flight to get here
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
um whether i take that money or not i
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't know but so far i've not taken any
 
00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:58.069 align:start position:0%
don't know but so far i've not taken any
money

00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
any further questions of dr petty
 
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:02.630 align:start position:0%
any further questions of dr petty
yes

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
just follow follow up with that with the
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
crowd sourcing was that from an
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
organization or
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
who did the crowd sourcing
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure that was that was uh i
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
was gone by that point and they worked
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
no we're not going to have anybody in
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
the crowd responding to that thank you
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much doctor thanks so
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
much for the opportunity to testify
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh what i'm going to do now because
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're starting to get a whole lot more
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
cards and then when we started out we're
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
going to limit the testimony to three
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
minutes i have some coming in parking
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
down 10 minutes more than that
 
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:44.309 align:start position:0%
down 10 minutes more than that
um

00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
so it's not uh it's very typical and
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
normal that we do limit time so we're
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
gonna start timing and it'd be about
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
three minutes per per person so if you
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
have testimony again if it's written
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
testimony would you please submit the
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
written testimony and not necessarily
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
read it to us because we can also take
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
the time and we will to read any
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that's provided to us so i'd
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
hello and thank you
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
my name is joanna brown from manchester
 
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
maths don't work and there is a mountain
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
of scientific studies to prove that i
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
have given this evidence to the
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
manchester school board back in
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
september and they ignored it
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
they ignored us
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
every meeting we were there citing the
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
there is no science behind mass stopping
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
airborne viruses such as covid but there
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
are not numerous dangers to our kids
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
from wearing masks all day
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
i have three children in high school
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
kovit is with us forever
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
it's just like the flu and keeping
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
physical distancing and improved
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
ventilation is fantastic there are no
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
side effects to that but there are side
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
effects to wearing a mask all day
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
especially for our youngest population
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
mass don't help they hurt
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
it is very hard to read emotions when
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
someone covers their face facial cues
 
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
and visual expressions are part of body
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
language that we learn as a very young
 
00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.710 align:start position:0%
language that we learn as a very young
age

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
age
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
reading lips is an integral part of
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
speech development for your very young
 
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.549 align:start position:0%
speech development for your very young
children

00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
constant mask wearing is slowing their
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
progress and i believe some testimony
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
has been submitted by the speech and
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
language therapists in new hampshire
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
constant mask wearing interrupts into
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
personal relations for older children as
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
well mass cause anxiety for teenagers
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
because they can't tell whether someone
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
is smiling at them or frowning at them
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
and this is critical for teenagers that
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
are going through
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
some very big emotional turmoil right
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
now about when life will ever return to
 
00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:17.910 align:start position:0%
now about when life will ever return to
normal

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
normal
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
a nurse who spoke at one of the last
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
manchester school board meetings
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
gave some very moving testimony
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
she is on the front lines in the
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals and she is seeing a huge spike
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
in er visits from teenagers suffering
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
from depression and suicide attempts
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
there is something seriously going wrong
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
it is time to make mass optional and
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
return to normal vaccines and masking is
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
still possible for anyone with a high
 
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.030 align:start position:0%
still possible for anyone with a high
risk

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
this is a parental decision not a state
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
masking as a psychological mechanism to
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
scare our kids will be easier to control
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
when they grow up
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
hypocrisy is
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
causing greater frustration and
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
confusion for these kids they watch on
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
tv with a super bowl and no one's
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask and then they have to go
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
back to school the next day and wear a
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
mask all day
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
and they get told by their teachers some
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
of them not so kindly that they're going
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
to kill somebody if they don't wear
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
their mask properly
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
there is some really awful things going
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
on in the school system and nobody is
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
paying attention to it
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
let's stop these health mandates before
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
they divide us any further
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
please vote to make mass optional in all
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
schools our kids who have no serious
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
risk of covid should never be mandated
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
to wear one just to get an education
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
not ever again
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much all right
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
well you'll take any questions
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative luno
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh thanks very much thanks for uh for
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
joining us uh this morning you mentioned
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
that um or your testimony said covid is
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
the same as the flu i was wondering if
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
you could um
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
speak to that as it relates to mortality
 
00:57:12.559 --> 00:57:13.990 align:start position:0%
speak to that as it relates to mortality
rate

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not referring to mortality rates i'm
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
talking about the prevalence of
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
the flu the flu is with us every year it
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
varies from year to year and that's what
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
they're predicting covid to be right a
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
new virus a new variant is going to come
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
out every year
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
and like the last omicron variant that
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
just came out
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
it was very contagious
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
but it was nothing more than a head cold
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
for most people who got it
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
yes would you would you believe that the
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
more mortality rate for coven 19
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
is uh is an order of magnitude greater
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
than mortality rate for the flu i think
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
the death reporting rates are
 
00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.470 align:start position:0%
the death reporting rates are
questionable

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
questionable
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think many people were reported to die
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
with covid when they simply died with
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
something else and
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
contracted covid when they were in the
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
hospital i think early treatment for
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
kovid did not happen
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
and many deaths could have been
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
prevented if we had health care had
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
acted differently in the beginning of
 
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.190 align:start position:0%
acted differently in the beginning of
covid

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
covid
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
i think there are a lot of big questions
 
00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
about the death rates
 
00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
of kovid
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
that still have to be answered
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
00:58:25.599 --> 00:58:26.710 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
committee

00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
if you could press the silver button
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to refocus that the bill
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
is about prohibiting school boards and
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
accredited non-public schools from
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
adopting enforcing or implementing
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
policies that require students or
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
members of the public to wear face
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
coverings i don't want to address the
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
efficacy of masks
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
and i just kind of have to
 
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.470 align:start position:0%
and i just kind of have to
um

00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
i'd like to start with the axiom that
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
federal funding is the tail that was the
 
00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.630 align:start position:0%
federal funding is the tail that was the
dog

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
dog
 
00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:17.430 align:start position:0%
dog
and

00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
my name is catherine smith i'm a
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
registered nurse with a bachelor's in
 
00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.910 align:start position:0%
registered nurse with a bachelor's in
science

00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
science
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
and i worked in community health for the
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
last seven years
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
i've spent many many hours researching
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
the efficacy of masks the benefits the
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
benefits versus the detriment the
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
violations if any to human rights civil
 
00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:34.150 align:start position:0%
violations if any to human rights civil
rights

00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
i've made pleas along with other parents
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
for school board members to consider the
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
mass mandates as unacceptable for our
 
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
school-age boys and girls
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
collectively along with myself and other
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
parents as i've watched um different
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
testimonies to school board members and
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
i've written down the site you know
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
the laws and things that they were
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
citing as violations and i researched
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
those lots of times things were
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
i agree taken out of context or had
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
already been tried in the courts and um
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
and ruled on
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
but these laws ranged from natural law
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
to hay conventions humanitarian
 
01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.670 align:start position:0%
to hay conventions humanitarian
conventions

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
conventions
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
and then i i've read parts of the uh the
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
essa grants and some
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
copies of applications
 
01:00:22.079 --> 01:00:22.870 align:start position:0%
copies of applications
and

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
within the process i found that
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
this in the application process the
 
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
schools when they were applying for the
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
s grants the schools were required to
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
lay out
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
a safety plan on how they were going to
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
provide a safe environment and
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
this included lots of
 
01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
schools stating that they would
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
refer to the department of health and
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
human services or the cdc guidelines
 
01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
i have here that the role of the
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
the school board
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
is it exists to provide appropriate
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities for our
 
01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.549 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities for our
students

01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
and it should be prior
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
prioritized by what is best for the
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
student and what enhances the student
 
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.430 align:start position:0%
student and what enhances the student
achievement

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
parent in the community dealing with the
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
situation i would go to many school
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
board meetings and we would offer our
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
opinions and ask the school board to
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
make their decisions based on our
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
concerns but every meeting they went
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
back to the metrics of the guidelines
 
01:01:24.559 --> 01:01:25.349 align:start position:0%
back to the metrics of the guidelines
for

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
masking based on case numbers and based
 
01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.390 align:start position:0%
masking based on case numbers and based
on

01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
the hospital capacity so for somehow
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
that just didn't seem to me that it was
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
in the best sense of the student and
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's where they were directing their
 
01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.430 align:start position:0%
that's where they were directing their
attention

01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
so also in my research i came across
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
this very interesting document that was
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
put together in 2009
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
and it was about state the state
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
sovereignty movement and child welfare
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the um
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
the goal of this this document was to
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.950 align:start position:0%
the goal of this this document was to
inform

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
inform
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
the state legislators of the concerns of
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
these people based on
 
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh child welfare and communist goals the
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
cold war era
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
and there was a included federal child
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
welfare laws a plea for justice yeah
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
you've gone by your three minutes now
 
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
if you have materials that you're
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
looking at you could submit those
 
01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.470 align:start position:0%
looking at you could submit those
materials

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
materials
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay i would just like to i would just
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
like to make the connection so that i
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
don't seem like i was just rambling but
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line we have to
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
accept that under contemplate that our
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
children are being exploited for federal
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
funding the esr grants have brought in
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars into these schools
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
under the guise of their public health
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
and safety
 
01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.430 align:start position:0%
and safety
and

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
nobody's even sure of the efficacy of
 
01:02:42.549 --> 01:02:42.559 align:start position:0%
the masks
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
and that needs to be evaluated how much
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
federal funding are we allowing to come
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
in and to control the situation
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
by accepting these this money
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
and taking away our sovereignty as
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
parents who elect school board members
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
and as as citizens of the state thank
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%

for coming today
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
hi my name is nicole souza and i drove
 
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
here in the snowstorm from amherst
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
i have poured over hundreds or thousands
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
of hours spending time on covid so if
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
you have any questions about any studies
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
including the bangladesh study or the
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
fatality rate you can ask me after but
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to focus on
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
my personal experience with the schools
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
in september 2020 i was put in a very
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
difficult position should i pull my son
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
out of a private school that my family
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
has loved and cherished for years
 
01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:52.069 align:start position:0%
has loved and cherished for years
or

01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
should i uh
 
01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
when i'm a full-time working
 
01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:56.630 align:start position:0%
when i'm a full-time working
parent

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
or should i force him to cover his face
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
all day long
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
i agonized over the choice every day i
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
dream about moving somewhere where my
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
son can breathe free
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think about all the millions of kids
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
around the world including australia
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
denmark sweden uk
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
where they never match children under
 
01:04:17.599 --> 01:04:18.950 align:start position:0%
where they never match children under
12.

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
12.
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
they get to see their teachers smile
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
their voices are not muffled
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
they can feel the fresh air on their
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
beautiful cute faces
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
they are told that school is safe school
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
they get to talk to their friends at
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
lunch and laugh
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
all mine is forced to eat inside in
 
01:04:44.799 --> 01:04:46.549 align:start position:0%
all mine is forced to eat inside in
silence

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
silence

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
because they have to take off their

because they have to take off their
masks

01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
masks
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
instead of breathing fresh air and
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
feeling it on his skin
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
he has to feel the heat and moisture
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.589 --> 01:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
he can't see his feet when he walks
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
because as you know the mass impacts
 
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
your vision
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
he doesn't even know what his teacher's
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
face looks like
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
his teacher saw the yearbook photos and
 
01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
his teacher saw the yearbook photos and
said

01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
wow they're so cute
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
facial expressions were the primary

forever
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
what are we doing to our children
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
why are the most restrictions on the
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
least at-risk group
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
why are we experimenting on our children
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
with these new devices that they've
 
01:05:54.799 --> 01:05:55.670 align:start position:0%
with these new devices that they've
never

01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
never
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
worn before
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
we haven't done one randomized control
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
trial on children
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't the burden should be on the
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
intervention to prove safety and
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
efficacy it shouldn't be on us to prove
 
01:06:10.319 --> 01:06:12.950 align:start position:0%
efficacy it shouldn't be on us to prove
harm

01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
we should have when you're being forced
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
any experiments which this is an
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
experiment because we have never done it
 
01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.710 align:start position:0%
experiment because we have never done it
before

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
should require informed consent which
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
means that we should not be coerced by
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
school administrations who are under
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
pressure by people that have used fear
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
as a virtue
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
parents have had enough
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's time if some parents today are
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
lucky that their children in mount new
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire get their masks off mine
 
01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.190 align:start position:0%
hampshire get their masks off mine
doesn't

01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
i could choose to take just about at the
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
end of your time
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
you are at 10 of your time okay thanks
 
01:06:49.039 --> 01:06:50.470 align:start position:0%
you are at 10 of your time okay thanks
um

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's causing conflict in our schools
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
it's time to give the power back to the
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
parents give back informed consent
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
bring back smiles and never let this
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
happen to our children again you want
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
this to be on our children you should
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
show it in
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
excellent research with randomized
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
controlled trials like we've done every
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
other intervention thank you thank you
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions from the
 
01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.990 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions from the
committee

01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
um before i start
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
this is just some of my materials
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
i did not hand out
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
printed out materials i will email it
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
because there are links
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
to citations to studies
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
and other information that is very
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
important to understand
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
can i start now yes go ahead
 
01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for allowing me to
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
testify my name is maureen hardy from

degree in epidemiology
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
when evaluating mitigation strategy for
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
a disease whether from the perspective
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
of a pharmaceutical product or a public
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
health policy the risk benefit analysis
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
must be considered
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
based on multiple studies and population
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
data the risk benefit analysis does not
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
support the use of facial mass for the
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
prevention of covet 19 especially for
 
01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.070 align:start position:0%
prevention of covet 19 especially for
children

01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
the wearing of facial masks does not
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
prevent the transmission of respiratory
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
viruses for example sars cove ii
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
and i have several studies that i'll
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
email you and by today's testimony
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
children are extremely low risk of bad
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
outcomes from the infection with sars
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
cove 2 with a zero percent death rate
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
per the cdc since january 1st 2020 and i
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
pulled that data yesterday from the cdc
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
website wearing masks is not a benign
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
intervention and causes serious and
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
potentially long long term damage to
 
01:09:39.679 --> 01:09:40.870 align:start position:0%
potentially long long term damage to
children

01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
mask worrying causes physical
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
psychological and social damage to
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
children we also know that masks
 
01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
encourage mouth breeding in children
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
which leads to facial deformities masks
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
interfere with the children learning
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
socially through facial expressions
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
speech learning is lost in the very
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
young learning deficits have been
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
observed in all an israeli-canadian
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
study published in cognitive research in
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
february 2022 found that masks disrupt
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
holistic processing and face perception
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
in school-aged children
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
masks keep other pathogens trapped near
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
the mouth and nose in the lungs of
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
children these are larger pathogens and
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
include bacteria mold and parasites
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
finally children need to be free
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
to be exposed to the natural environment
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
to keep their immune system strong
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
therefore the risk benefit analysis does
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
not support the use of facial masks as a
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
public health mitigation strategy
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
especially for school children there is
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
zero benefit and high risk the mask
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations were put into place by
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
national and local public health
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
agencies without evidence of benefit and
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
with and without evaluation of risks and
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
followed by school boards and
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
administrators who had nother no other
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
sources of guidance
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
we now have 2020 hindsight and
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
understand that masking children is
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
wrong let us correct this now and not
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
put the school boards in the position of
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
having to mandate bad policy ever again
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
there is a fear of a more lethal covet
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
virus arriving around the world but the
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
spread of another respiratory virus also
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
would not be mitigated by a mask wearing
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
i wish that masks worked but i know that
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
i'll stop there thank you very much
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
other questions represent hobson
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
being here today um i have two questions
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
first one is you said you worked with
 
01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.790 align:start position:0%
first one is you said you worked with
pathogens

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
pathogens
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
yes and did you wear a mask while you
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
were working with those pathogens
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
i worked with patient samples and for
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
the most part i did not wear a mask but
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
when i was working with mycobacterium
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis which causes tuberculosis
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
and pathogenic fungi
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
i wore an n95 mask and per ocean
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
regulation i had to be fit tested
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
annually and trained but in addition
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
i was wearing a gown and gloves i was
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
working in a biological safety cabinet
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
and a negative pressure
 
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:07.669 align:start position:0%
and a negative pressure
room

01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
so these are not the type of
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
interventions that are realistic for a
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
school child in addition the n95 masks
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
are not approved for the use in children
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
and the particles that i'm working that
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
i was working with are specifically
 
01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.149 align:start position:0%
i was working with are specifically
mentioned

01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
by the package insert for the mask
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
it specifically says that
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
smaller particles like
 
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.630 align:start position:0%
smaller particles like
viruses

01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
viruses
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
are there's no rec there's no
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation for those in the in the
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
package insert only it specifically
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
mentions mycobacteria tuberculosis and
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
mold and it also mentions bacillus
 
01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.390 align:start position:0%
mold and it also mentions bacillus
anthracis

01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
second question was um
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
i did not know i i didn't
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i did not know that uh breathing
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
through your mouth could cause physical
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
dysphor deformity is that what you said
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
yes this has been this has been known
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
for a long time
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
so i do have a link to that study and i
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
i will email it to um
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
represent yes represent
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i have a question
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
if somebody has coveted
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
and they're wearing a mask
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
does that have a detrimental effect
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
potentially because you're not getting
 
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
as much oxygen as you normally would
 
01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.750 align:start position:0%
as much oxygen as you normally would
um

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.590 align:start position:0%
um
well

01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not a physician so i i can't answer
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
that i could just tell you what what i
 
01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:38.790 align:start position:0%
that i could just tell you what what i
believe

01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
you're probably re-breathing to some
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
extent i mean a lot of it is coming out
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
the sides
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
and the top of the mask and the pores of
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
the mask but you're probably
 
01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.990 align:start position:0%
the mask but you're probably
re-breathing

01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
re-breathing
 
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.030 align:start position:0%
re-breathing
um

01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of it and therefore you are
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
re-inoculating yourself with the virus
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that more virus can multiply in your
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
nose and throat and go to your lungs so
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's probably a bad idea
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
i have a card here looks like it's reed
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
lambert and is tricia
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
lamp are you both on the same
 
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.790 align:start position:0%
 
party

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:35.830 align:start position:0%
party
yeah

01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and the committee
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
as mentioned i brought my son reed here
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's by no mistake that his name is reed
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
because he has a reading disability
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to make this short i think
 
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
we've talked about the efficacy and i
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
think we have a lot of experts here that
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
have covered that so i i'd like to make
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
this more of a witness um
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
statement of exactly what is happening
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
to these children
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
and reid is a perfect example of that
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
um reed has had a reading disability
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
since um
 
01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.870 align:start position:0%
since um
was

01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
noted in in first grade he's had
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful teachers
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
in fact when he went to um
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
school and by the way we're in the
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
hopkinton school district
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
he had a
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
language teachers
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
that spend a tremendous amount of time
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
with him to
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
learn how to read because he is a
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
short-term memory issue
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that they told us
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
was what was already stated is that the
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
moving of the mouth
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
and actually
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
showing they actually would draw this on
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
the board repeatedly
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
was so important for him to understand
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
how to pronounce
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
the english language
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
this this went on
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
through um his um he was that he's now
 
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
in ninth grade he is homeschooled
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
um so as you can imagine with a
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
disability has an iep or an
 
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.070 align:start position:0%
disability has an iep or an
individualized

01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
individualized
 
01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.189 align:start position:0%
individualized
education

01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
program for himself
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
that um he was one unable to wear a mask
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
and the school actually approved that in
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
the spring of last year in may of last
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
year and he did not have a mask now
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
there were other issues that i took
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
that i felt were still incorrect and not
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
good for his welfare
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
like playing a drum in a closed off room
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
by himself with the band outside
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
in the other room on a drum that didn't
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
really work
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
i mean this is what they're
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
relinquishing them to segregating them
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
over into other locations
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
but he did was maskless um because we
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
did not
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
allow it anymore and it was by the way
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
in his iep that coven needed
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
to be addressed in any way shape or form
 
01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.709 align:start position:0%
to be addressed in any way shape or form
so

01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
the esser funds came into play yes or
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
three so if you're familiar with those
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
um sr3 as they had mentioned as others
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
had testified pretty much made them
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
follow the cdc guidance and it was very
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
clear by our school board we had to be
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
there 180 days
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
that was the goal
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
so every child had to wear a mask
 
01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.630 align:start position:0%
so every child had to wear a mask
so

01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
in the sense that he already was
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
masculist and had approved was
 
01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.709 align:start position:0%
masculist and had approved was
relinquished

01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
relinquished
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
so so here we have a child who has
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
trouble reading
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
being unable
 
01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:34.470 align:start position:0%
being unable
to

01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
have the proper care that he needs to
 
01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.830 align:start position:0%
have the proper care that he needs to
learn

01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
learn
 
01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:38.790 align:start position:0%
learn
so

01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
the esr funds are driving
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
drove exactly these decisions our school
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
boards are not meant to make medical
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
decisions for our children i was advised
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
by the superintendent i'll finish up
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
i was advised by the superintendent that
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
i did not have the ability to um i gave
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
them do not consent letters for both of
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
my children
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
and i was unable to not consent as a
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
parent they can't put bug spray on them
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
but they can put a mask across their
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
face in order to breathe
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
there's something not right here
 
01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:13.830 align:start position:0%
there's something not right here
i

01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
i respectfully ask that you
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
vote in support of this bill
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's important so that masks never go on
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
our children again without their parents
 
01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.310 align:start position:0%
our children again without their parents
consent

01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.510 align:start position:0%
consent
um

01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
the other thing is real quick is the
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
state website i think we talked about
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
the mortality
 
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
the state website lacks that it calls it
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
one percent um i actually looked it up
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
this morning number of co people who had
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
coveted versus those who have died and
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's 99.9305
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
so what exactly how
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
of people that have recovered from
 
01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
coveting did not pass away so it's
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
99.993 at what point
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
do we
 
01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.310 align:start position:0%
do we
um

01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
look at this and say what is the what is
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
the benefit of wearing a mask on a child
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
for seven hours a day
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll be happy to say thank you
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%

for coming in today um i just wanted to
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
make sure i understood um what you were
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
saying about
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
reed's iep
 
01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.870 align:start position:0%
reed's iep
um

01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
did the iep say that
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
he could be maskless
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
and that that was rescinded
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
or did the iep did you have a new iep
 
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
meeting that changed the iep or did they
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
just say regardless of the iep he has to
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
wear a mask
 
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you good question so
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
we when he the mask came off his face in
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
may of 2021
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
it was a correspondence back and forth
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
with the superintendent at that time
 
01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.270 align:start position:0%
with the superintendent at that time
and

01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
they agreed to take off the mask
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
the language did not specifically state
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
match but it did have language regarding
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
covet and that they would do anything to
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
address his issues as it related to his
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
to his learning
 
01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.270 align:start position:0%
to his learning
so

01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
i think that answers the majority of the
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.110 align:start position:0%
question so
um

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
in the new in the new year we were
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
pretty much told after we sent the do
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
not consent letters
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have the right to do not
 
01:20:22.159 --> 01:20:23.270 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have the right to do not
consent

01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
and then i explained the iep i said he's
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
been not he's had it off all summer
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
because he has summer school
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
and they said
 
01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.189 align:start position:0%
and they said
um

01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
um they said the board had voted which
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
they didn't to um
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
to put masks back on their faces and
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
that he had to wear one and that i would
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
have to go through the whole process all
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
over again
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
thank you

01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
you you said at some point that he was
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
homeschooled did that happen after i
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
mean can you explain that sure
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
so the beginning of the year um once we
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
were told that they had to wear a mask i
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
also have a daughter who also attended
 
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
she's a junior
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
we walked in every day with the attempt
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
to go to school and i said they're here
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
but they will not wear a mask and say
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
suspended them
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
because they would not wear a mask so i
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
refused to allow them to be targeted
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
sitting in a room somewhere
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
whether it's the library or wherever
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
they had us we're going to assign them
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
and i took them home we did that for
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
approximately 15 15 days
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%

01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
but the day before
 
01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
i attended a
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
school board meeting
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
and it was an emergency session meeting
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
that they had called about the masks
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
so the room was full
 
01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:30.870 align:start position:0%
so the room was full
and

01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
before anybody spoke from the parents
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
or a teacher came as well to tell them
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
the impact
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
on the students that she sees daily they
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
come into the classroom
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
some don't even speak they hide behind
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
their mask
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
they look at the floor she tries to
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
engage them with her eyes and they don't
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
even look up
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
the children have been hiding behind the
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
mask some of them don't
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
teenage years are difficult
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
some people who are introverts it's
 
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:00.950 align:start position:0%
some people who are introverts it's
their

01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
safety to have a mask on
 
01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.350 align:start position:0%
safety to have a mask on
so

01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
i i attended the school board meeting to
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
listen to what people had to say and i'm
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
glad i went
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the school board didn't
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
listen to the parents or the teacher
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
they voted even before they listened
 
01:23:18.149 --> 01:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
they said they were going to keep the
 
01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:19.510 align:start position:0%
they said they were going to keep the
masks

01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
masks
 
01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.390 align:start position:0%
masks
nobody

01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then they
 
01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
said public comment
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
the parents were horrified
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
and so at the end when they had all
 
01:23:29.199 --> 01:23:30.390 align:start position:0%
and so at the end when they had all
listened

01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
listened
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
and and the parents didn't understand
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
what was going on
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
and someone said wait wait aren't we
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
going to debate are you going to listen
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
to us and
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
maybe talk amongst yourselves the school
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
board one of them said i call for an
 
01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.270 align:start position:0%
board one of them said i call for an
adjournment

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
adjournment
 
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
and the rest of them all
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
agreed and they said it's adjourned
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
so i just want to say that they're not
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
interested um where i am in data
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
i listen to the expert
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
they i've set numerous emails
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
telling them of the data that's out
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
there about the masks and we can debate
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
whether you think they're effective or
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
not i don't think they are but
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
they don't want to listen at all
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
so i think you need to vote for this
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
so that you can protect my child
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
because they obviously don't have his
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
best interest at heart or at least i
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
don't think so
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative cordelia thank you you're
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions sure i guess
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um i just wanted to make sure
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
i understood what she said um at that
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
board meeting you attended
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
um the board discussed the mask
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
requirement and voted to require masks
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
before public comment and hearing from
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
parents is that correct that's correct
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%

01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
so i live in stratham but my um son
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
lives with his father and lives in um
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
we know okay thank you further further
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative waltz
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
yes um so you testified that you think
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
the school district did not have your
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
son's best interests at heart
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
listen to everybody i'm hearing what
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
you're saying but i also heard from a
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
whose son has severe respiratory
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
problems and needs at least during covey
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
needed the people around him masked he's
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
a child who's probably hospitalized one
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
month a year with respiratory issues
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
and and getting covered could possibly
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
have killed him given his severe
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
respiratory issues so you've got school
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
districts with these kids he happens to
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
be a senior in high school that have
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
these severe respiratory issues that
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
need protecting and then you've got
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
children like yours
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
what do you propose a district does to
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
find the balance between somebody who
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't want their child masked and
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
somebody who is life and death whether
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
or not their child is masked um i just
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
have a question does that chat what does
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
that child do during the regular cold
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
and flu season isn't that a detrimental
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
risk to his health can he get pneumonia
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't know his personal the answer
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
is it's happened to him so yes that's a
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
serious problem so then what do they do
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
then what was the answer then send them
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
to school
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
well then i don't i don't see the
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
difference and i will say
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
my other son has asthma
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
and he can't wear a mask
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
and he can't play basketball because
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
they make him wear a mask if he wants to
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
play basketball and he can't go to
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
regular school
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
so what do you suppose my son should do
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
who can't wear a mask what's he supposed
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
to do i had to homeschool him so i don't
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
and i've i i understand that you have an
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
opinion and i get that but there comes a
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
time where i will say
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
if that is the policy and if you're
 
01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
going to tell me you know what's really
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
funny they didn't tell you the policy
 
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
until way bef like five minutes before
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
last year that they were gonna require
 
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
masks so then i was supposed to scramble
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
and try to find somewhere for my child
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
to go to school why was that why didn't
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
they tell us in june why didn't they
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
tell us in july when i could have found
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
a place for him to go to school
 
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
what was the story there so i understand
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
you have an opinion i have an opinion
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
and there's gonna come a time where i'm
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
gonna say no more i'm gonna say no more
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't have to send them to
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
public school
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
so that that's that's the reality
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
and i wish that they would listen more
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
all i was trying to point out is that
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
school districts are getting pulled from
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
both sides
 
01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:24.870 align:start position:0%
both sides
and

01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
it's not that i have an opinion at this
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
point it's that
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
you indicated that the school district
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
just didn't care and what i'm suggesting
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
is they care they're just getting pulled
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
from both sides and that was the point
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
of that story
 
01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.070 align:start position:0%
of that story
um

01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
so the winneconnet school principal
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
last month there was a basketball game
 
01:27:45.199 --> 01:27:46.550 align:start position:0%
last month there was a basketball game
rival

01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
rival
 
01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
and so he decided it was a good idea to
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
make a difference between 850 kids and a
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
thousand kids
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
in a um basketball court
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
what could that have possibly made a
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
difference so my question to him was
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
fine i get that you're trying to come up
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
with some sort of visual restriction so
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
it looks like you're doing something i
 
01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:08.870 align:start position:0%
it looks like you're doing something i
understand

01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
what are you going to do with the kids
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
that didn't get a ticket
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
do you have some sort of
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
consolation prize for someone who didn't
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
get a ticket now see that tells me that
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
he did not care for those kids at all
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
because he said nope sorry you didn't
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
get a ticket even though they've not
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
been able to go to things and been
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
restricted and all this other why didn't
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
he have an answer why didn't he give
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
them a consolation prize why did they
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
have to sit home and not have a ticket
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't understand so when they
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
say they don't have the best interest i
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
they're trying to have a visual
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
thing that says we're doing something
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
well sometimes that visual thing is
 
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
causing harm
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
so that's my answer i don't i don't know
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
what you know
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt
 
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr and thank you for being
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
here taking the time on a day like this
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
to um to come here to concord you
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned basketball a couple of times
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
in the context of your sign and then
 
01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:01.830 align:start position:0%
in the context of your sign and then
later

01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to the gems my question
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
could you amplify that a little bit when
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
you say
 
01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:07.910 align:start position:0%
you say
uh

01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.270 align:start position:0%
uh
he

01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't wear a mat or had to wear a
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
mask while playing basketball was this
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
an intramural situation a pe situation
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
or a team situation could you explain
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
that a little bit um so um
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
my older son lives in hampton and i live
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
in stratham
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
so in stratum
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
they use the um basketball town for the
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
school you they use the school gym some
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
of the towns have decided that they're
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
not going to do that they go to um the
 
01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.870 align:start position:0%
not going to do that they go to um the
rim

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
rim
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
facility and i don't believe they
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
require mass for them to wear during
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
um playing
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
so this was town so i signed him up and
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
i didn't know
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
that they were going to require masks
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
so um i signed him up and then the night
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
before we were supposed to go to tryouts
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
he um they sent out an email that said
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
just to let you know all masks are
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
required and i thought well maybe they
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
just mean for me
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
and he could play
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
so then i
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh emailed the town
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
administrator for the recreation and she
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
said no really sorry but
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
the schools require you to wear a mask
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
during playing of basketball
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
and i said well he can't
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
can't wear him he gets an anxiety attack
 
01:30:16.719 --> 01:30:17.510 align:start position:0%
can't wear him he gets an anxiety attack
so

01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
i said he can't so she said oh i'm
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
really sorry but and we'll refund your
 
01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:22.950 align:start position:0%
really sorry but and we'll refund your
money

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
follow up yes
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you the concrete monitor had a
 
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
photo of a basketball
 
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
game where one player was guarding a
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
player one player was masked and the
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
other player was not so
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
does winner kind of do you know does to
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm trying to hear you so does
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
winner kind of have a
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
requirement for the players and their
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
teams to where mastering games are you
 
01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
know you know what i don't think they do
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
for winneconne but i think when they
 
01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
went to portsmouth they had two
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not 100 positive um but
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
the older kids i think are probably a
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
little bit more um difficult to make do
 
01:31:07.679 --> 01:31:08.950 align:start position:0%
little bit more um difficult to make do
things

01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
so they would just wear them on their
 
01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.310 align:start position:0%
so they would just wear them on their
chin

01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
chin
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
hi good morning good morning um thanks
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
for having me um
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
i was gonna speak to a few things that
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
have already been covered so i'll just
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
kind of skip that
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
but the doctor earlier did mention
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
industrial masking and i did want to
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
comment quickly on that i worked in lead
 
01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
abatement in manchester for about two
 
01:31:51.679 --> 01:31:52.870 align:start position:0%
abatement in manchester for about two
years

01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
we had to have half face respirators
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
with cartridges
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
i need to do a fit test medical
 
01:31:58.159 --> 01:31:59.590 align:start position:0%
i need to do a fit test medical
clearance

01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
clearance
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
the fit test included you know smoke to
 
01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that it was fitted to your
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
face properly a proper seal
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
i was trained in mass cleaning and
 
01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:07.910 align:start position:0%
i was trained in mass cleaning and
maintenance

01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
so when i saw that there were mass
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
requirements for kids with the cloth
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
masks i was really confused because i
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
was just like this doesn't make sense to
 
01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:15.669 align:start position:0%
was just like this doesn't make sense to
me

01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's just a comment on some of my
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
experiences with
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
masking industrial masking and so seeing
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
kids wear these cloth masks hasn't made
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
sense to me for a while
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
seeing in manchester walking by the
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
public schools and watching kids outside
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
running and playing with their mask on
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
also doesn't make sense to me the world
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
health organization counsels against
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
masking kids during physical activities
 
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
so as not to compromise their breathing
 
01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand why we're doing
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
this in the united states
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
the other thing i wanted to comment on
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
science briefs published by the cdc show
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
that most transmission in schools is
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
staff to staff rather than transmission
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
from students to staff
 
01:32:56.639 --> 01:32:57.350 align:start position:0%
from students to staff
so

01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
children are low risk they're not high
 
01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.629 align:start position:0%
children are low risk they're not high
transmitters

01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
transmitters
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
i don't this is another thing that
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to me um
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
and this is something we've known for a
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
long time and it's been two years and
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's still happening
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
so it's gone on long enough it's
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
egregious um it's wrong
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's security theater
 
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking that we put a stop to this
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
and we prevent it from happening again
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
so i'd like
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
these bills to be supported those are my
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
comments thank you thank you very much
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.830 align:start position:0%

01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
because i think this is important i
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
think this is really important the
 
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
bottom line here is when
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
i'll go on
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um the bottom line here is our
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
children have been abused for the last
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
two years we have we have watched
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
for our children to be emotionally
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
abused you've heard testimony about the
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse that's going on i want
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit about what it feels
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
like for someone of a domestic violence
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
situation or a child who has been
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
physically or emotionally or abused
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
sexually abused to have to put a mask on
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
their face
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
just think about that i want all of you
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
to go home tonight and do this
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
because that's what the mass feels likes
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
to these children
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
we talk about reactive attachment
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
disorder we talk about risk costs
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis risk cost benefit
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
analysis this is our children
 
01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
this is tomorrow's future and it's just
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
a mask remember when it was just a mask
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
for all of us and now it's keep moving
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
that goal post i made over 3 000 masks
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
from my town alone so our children could
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
be masked
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
it was only for two weeks
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
how long has it been now
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
how long has it been and the school
 
01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
boards and the school districts are not
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
do not for the most part have our
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
children's best interest at heart i
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
don't have any children in the school
 
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
systems right now thank god and my
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
grandchildren have my my daughter has
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
chosen to homeschool her
 
01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
grandchildren home school my
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
grandchildren again i am thankful
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
i don't i have gone to now 14 different
 
01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
school boards and just watched
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
and observed the way that parents are
 
01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:15.679 align:start position:0%
being treated and the way that in
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
some instance look around
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
look around to you folks the people that
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
are paying attention and the people are
 
01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.189 align:start position:0%
are paying attention and the people are
not

01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
okay the bottom line here is we are
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
being we are we've been told kids aren't
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
the problem the parents are
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that be a problem for us
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's too soon to really know how much
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
damage we've done to our children we
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
can't just know that it's just masks
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of other stuff too how about
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
we just stop doing damage how about that
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
um other cultures other cultures that
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
require masking or hiding of the face
 
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
they have been dehumanized women who are
 
01:36:57.990 --> 01:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
forced to keep this
 
01:37:00.629 --> 01:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
it's so much easier to kill someone
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
when you can't exceed their expression
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's so much easier to disallow and
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
dehumanize someone when all you can see
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
is this
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's not okay
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
and i know this is just a mask but we
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
need to start taking our schools and our
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
school districts and our school boards
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
back we need to start saying no more we
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
are the parents we these are our
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
children these are not the school boards
 
01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
children these are not our towns
 
01:37:29.119 --> 01:37:30.070 align:start position:0%
children these are not our towns
children

01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
these are our children we are the
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
parents and it's time to say no more and
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
if we send a strong message with regards
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
to the mask
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
we will watch those dominoes fall thank
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%

01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%

01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'm involved in salem district
 
01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.510 align:start position:0%
i'm involved in salem district
court

01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's a mask arrest case
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
there have now been
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
four of these mask arrest cases
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
and the subject of the arrest was a
 
01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:29.109 align:start position:0%
and the subject of the arrest was a
grandmother

01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
grandmother
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
who was arrested
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
in front of her children and her
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and the the circumstances
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
were that a week ahead of the
 
01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
timberlane regional school district
 
01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:42.390 align:start position:0%
timberlane regional school district
meeting

01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
that notice was sent out
 
01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.350 align:start position:0%
that notice was sent out
where

01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
it said that parents were asked to wear
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
or attendees were asked to wear a mask
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
after the governor's executive order
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
that rescinded the mask mandates for
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
public meetings and for performances
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
and so taking those two facts taken
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
together it's reasonable to
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
for her to assume that she had in the
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
words of the arrest order she had
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
license and privilege to enter that
 
01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:16.870 align:start position:0%
license and privilege to enter that
meeting

01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
she went into the meeting she actually
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
went to
 
01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:20.629 align:start position:0%
went to
where

01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
people were going
 
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.590 align:start position:0%
people were going
in

01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.830 align:start position:0%
in
and

01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
then she
 
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to come back and and uh talk to
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
her friend who was
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
by this time the police had uh
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
who had
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
followed the
 
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
order of the school board the school
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
board put out a subsequent order that to
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
the police which was not public that
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
said that
 
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
that they were the people without mass
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
were to be blocked and if necessary
 
01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:50.070 align:start position:0%
were to be blocked and if necessary
arrested

01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
and so when she turned around and
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
she tried to motion to her friend to
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
come in she said i'm just going in and
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
then she was the policeman turned around
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
and arrested her
 
01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:02.950 align:start position:0%
and arrested her
and

01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
so i think this brings up a number of
 
01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.870 align:start position:0%
so i think this brings up a number of
issues

01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
on school boards and their abuse of
 
01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:11.109 align:start position:0%
on school boards and their abuse of
authority

01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
just on the face of it i would say it
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
goes to the separation of powers
 
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
these mandates are not laws they don't
 
01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.390 align:start position:0%
these mandates are not laws they don't
behave

01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
behave
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
like laws there's not the rules of
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
of statutory interpretation that are
 
01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.390 align:start position:0%
of statutory interpretation that are
applied

01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
applied
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
to them
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
it gives school boards executive powers
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
of arrest police powers
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
and legislative and judicial powers to
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
interpret and apply these
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
these laws
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
so kate bosse was humiliated humiliated
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
in front of her children and
 
01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:43.910 align:start position:0%
in front of her children and
grandchildren

01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
grandchildren
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
and was arrested under this and of
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
course presented from speaking she had
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
license and privilege
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
she was arrested for trespassing but
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
really she was arrested for not having a
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
mask that was and
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
this also forms a
 
01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:02.229 align:start position:0%
this also forms a
classic

01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
classic
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
abuse of authority and that it's an ex
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
post facto uh application uh given the
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
two orders the uh public notice
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
and then later the order to the
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
police uh a week later
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
so you say a law means one thing and
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
then you
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
turn around and
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
and apply it a different way that's an
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
exposed fact application it's the rarest
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
of beasts in the
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
legal realm that you have a criminal
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
ex post facto
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
case like this
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
so uh that was my testimony i'd be glad
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
to take questions
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
from yes representative waltz
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
yes are you an attorney
 
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
01:41:51.119 --> 01:41:52.629 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
committee

01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
nazi thank you very much you're welcome
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
i'm kathy mayo from nottingham thank you
 
01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for doing this
 
01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:17.669 align:start position:0%
and thank you for doing this
um

01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to my concerns
 
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
over the decision of masking which i
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
believe should be left to no one but the
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
parents this is my personal disclaimer
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
for god hath not given us the spirit of
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
fear but of power and of love and of a
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
sound mind
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
i've lost a lot of sleep over this and
 
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's been on my mind non-stop as there
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
is so much information and so many ways
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
to address this
 
01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
scientifically statistically politically
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
socially the list goes on
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
the one that gnaws at me the most is
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
spiritually we are all spiritual beings
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
with souls and our children are precious
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
innocent and deserve to be protected not
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
compromised by poor decisions
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
especially ones that have no merit
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
i have yet to find one randomized
 
01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
control study supporting the
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of mass they are
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
authorized not approved or licensed by
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
the federal government and
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
as emergency use authorization
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
and that's under the
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
federal food drug and cosmetic act and i
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
have the federal law title
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
i have a couple pictures to show you
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i do have them i can pass out
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
afterwards if you'd like
 
01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
what is this saying about
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
saying about us and what message are we
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
giving to our children is it okay for
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
adults to be clumped together in a large
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
gathering without masks but children
 
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
have to be masked and walk single file
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
i'm stretched out so they don't touch
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
another child
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
do you think they don't see this
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
you have to be honest about the
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
hypocrisy and don't for a minute think
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
that they aren't noticing or watching
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
children of sponges and make
 
01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:55.510 align:start position:0%
children of sponges and make
observations

01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
observations
 
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
more than any adult ever could it's a
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
huge part of how they learn and they've
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
been created that way for a reason and
 
01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
just because the teachers wear the masks
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
while in school too don't you
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
think this causes even more confusion
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
for them why only in school and not
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
outside of school why have i seen my
 
01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
teacher out of school without a mask on
 
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
i know the parents are getting these
 
01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
questions all the time how do you answer
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
these questions
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
just because she has
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
fingers and hands as the mask over their
 
01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.950 align:start position:0%
fingers and hands as the mask over their
face

01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
face
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
this is so disturbing
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
this has to break your heart this child
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
was asked to draw their
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
face and hair to make a self-portrait
 
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
just like the other picture do you see
 
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
any joy in this face
 
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh you won't find it of course you don't
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
because it's covered by a mask and not
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
even a pretty colored or decorated one
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's black a plain old black mask
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
the saying over the strong says after a
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
year and a half of daily mask wearing in
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
schools the face covering has become
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
part of the children's identity that's
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
just horrifying we're not only stripping
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
them of their identity dignity humanity
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
and self-esteem but we're robbing them
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
of seeing the joy of another child's
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
face or an adult's face correct me if
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong but i believe seeing another
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
person's facial expressions plays a
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
critical role in development
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
there is a day of reckoning coming
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
for these injustices and i can't wait
 
01:45:23.669 --> 01:45:23.679 align:start position:0%
when that happens but what i'm not
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
looking forward to is witnessing the
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
damage left in its wake
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
we've only seen the beginnings and if we
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
don't stop this
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit of cursive
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
manuscript whatever you want to call it
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
nathan flowers from jaffrey new
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire um
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
i would start by thanking you for still
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
holding this even though there's snow
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
outside so um took the trip out here um
 
01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:48.229 align:start position:0%
outside so um took the trip out here um
so

01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
i was thankful i came here and it wasn't
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
cancelled so thank you
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
um so as we've heard before little
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
children are sponges whether it be good
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
stuff or bad stuff that they hear around
 
01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.550 align:start position:0%
stuff or bad stuff that they hear around
them

01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
but when they wear mass
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
they can't learn emotional intelligence
 
01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
and communication skills go down the
 
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
drain because communication it's only 10
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
our voices the rest is
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
our faces and us moving around
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
so going back to the sponges thing when
 
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.510 align:start position:0%
so going back to the sponges thing when
um

01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
going back to the sponge metaphor
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
when they're wearing a mask it's like
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
cutting that sponge
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
in half
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
i have four four
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
lovely girls at home
 
01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
only two of which are in school aged
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
and this year when um
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
the school decided that they were going
 
01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:36.550 align:start position:0%
the school decided that they were going
to

01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
force them to wear mass on and off um
 
01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
luckily we chose to keep him home
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
because there's a parent's choice for
 
01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:43.590 align:start position:0%
because there's a parent's choice for
that

01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
we were able to use the educational
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
freedom account to obviously fund that
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
which obviously again thank you guys for
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
pushing that through
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
but back to that it should be parents
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
choice in schools whether we want them
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
to wear a mask or not a personal choice
 
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
if a teacher wants to wear one or not
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
not forced upon by the school local
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
governments and so on
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty much all i wanted to
 
01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
say keep it quick so more people can
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%

01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
insight of what i see as someone who
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
works with the kids so this week was um
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
bus driver appreciation week and i got
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
all these awesome cards from kids
 
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
and then i got one where they drew my
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
so these kids
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
sorry every time i do this i want to
 
01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:30.870 align:start position:0%
sorry every time i do this i want to
crack

01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
crack
 
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen these kids faces and i've
 
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
been driving them for two years
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
this is like
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
so safety wise this is horrible i cannot
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
identify the children i barely know
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
their names people who are standing at
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
the corner to pick them up
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know who they are i'm not
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to ask questions
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
this has been going on for so long and
 
01:48:55.590 --> 01:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's wrecking these kids
 
01:48:56.950 --> 01:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
all right so i have like
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
you get the basics
 
01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:02.390 align:start position:0%
you get the basics
um

01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to let you know so i've
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
been driving a school bus for five years
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
um i've not seen these kids faces
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
i mean i drive 95 kids and if they saw
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
me in the street they wouldn't know who
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
i am this is like
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
i didn't think i was gonna do this
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
um i just want you to know like it's so
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
hard to build up a relationship as a
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
school bus driver i have about five
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
minutes to greet them i try my hardest
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
to keep everybody up and happy and then
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
they want us to yell at
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
the kids to put a mask on and cover up
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
their personality it's like
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
so against everything we do as a
 
01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
volunteer to like work with children
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
like i don't understand at all how
 
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
anybody's making this decision unless
 
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
money is pushing them to do it even then
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't understand how people
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
aren't pushing back
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
um i work in go hogard they're still
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
pushing the employees to wear masks even
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
though we're not working with children
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
like in our break area it's just
 
01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:59.430 align:start position:0%
like in our break area it's just
ridiculous

01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
they're just power hungry and it's like
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
definitely showing and people who are
 
01:50:05.669 --> 01:50:05.679 align:start position:0%
here for the right reasons are being
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
forced out i'm definitely looking for
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
another job like i can't stand working
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
with people who are hurting children
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
i can't bring myself to tell kids to put
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
masks on
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
no teachers should be standing for this
 
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
i don't understand how it's been going
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
on for two years
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
um i just had a couple things that i um
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
i wanted to let you know how the kids
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
are interpreting all this stuff um
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
on the bus they play a little game
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's usually known as tag but they
 
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
play kobit and if you get tagged you're
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
it and you die this is what they think
 
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
of covid um
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
they wanted me last year to close the
 
01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:43.679 align:start position:0%
windows because they were scared kovit
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
was going to come in the bus and get
 
01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:46.229 align:start position:0%
was going to come in the bus and get
them

01:50:46.229 --> 01:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
they don't understand what's happening
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
and they're just being taught to fear
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
this is gonna mess them up for so many
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
years um the fear in their eyes when i
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
pass out the masks
 
01:50:59.430 --> 01:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
um if i run out for the day because 50
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
kids don't have masks and i run out of
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
number 51 they have fear in their eyes
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
because they're scared i don't know if
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
they're scared they're going to die in
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
the bus but they're scared that people
 
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
are going to now go approach them and
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
they want to be good and they want to
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
behave and they want to follow the rules
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
and we're making them up in this awkward
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
position where now because they don't
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
have a mask on they're bad and they're
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
rule breakers and that's not the case
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
these kids are innocent and they're not
 
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
going to die from this and we're we're
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
putting them in a horrible position um
 
01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
they're being just trained to fear and
 
01:51:30.149 --> 01:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
comply and not question things when i
 
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
questioned things i was told the cops
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
would be called on me
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
at work because i didn't want to wear a
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
mask they were told me do it because
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
everybody else is nobody has answers
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
this is the masks we're passing out for
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
the children in concord
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
non-medical masks it says right on there
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
not for use for viral infections will
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
not stop viruses we're just doing this
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
this is ridiculous we're lying to their
 
01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
faces and telling them believe me
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
because i'm an adult
 
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
i can't do that i don't understand why
 
01:51:59.109 --> 01:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
my boss is telling me to do this and why
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
he's not questioning his boss and when i
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
question anybody i get in trouble this
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
is like this is horrible okay sorry
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%

01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you oh my god i didn't think i was
 
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
going to speak
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for stepping up
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we all appreciate it i asked dr
 
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
petty earlier and i hate to put you in
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
the spot that's okay
 
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
but i asked him about the school bus
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
question and if you don't know if you're
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
here but the
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
understanding is the
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
the uh as districts go masculine uh it
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
sounds like buses will be the only
 
01:52:49.109 --> 01:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
given that you're a bus driver i know
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
you don't make policy but you you must
 
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
have supervisors or folks who give you
 
01:52:57.589 --> 01:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh guidance or policies so so do you
 
01:52:57.599 --> 01:52:58.390 align:start position:0%
uh guidance or policies so so do you
have

01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
any sense is anything coming to you in
 
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
terms of uh
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
school bus mask mandates i thought i
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
heard march 14th was something um
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
federally that masks would be released
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure though but for us we
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
have to when we're when we're with the
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
kids within
 
01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
um the socially distance we have to wear
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
a mask all the time so there's always
 
01:53:22.229 --> 01:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
kids on the bus so
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
i thought march 14th was something
 
01:53:25.990 --> 01:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
federally happening but i'm not 100 sure
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
because they were going to revisit it
 
01:53:29.189 --> 01:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and we can kind of follow up
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
on that too thank you yeah
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
i i have a question for you um
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
i i got to get this
 
01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:37.430 align:start position:0%
i i got to get this
straight

01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
straight
 
01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
when you're driving the bus you're and i
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it we do not have
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
enough bus drivers in this state to have
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
the cdl et cetera
 
01:53:46.239 --> 01:53:47.030 align:start position:0%
the cdl et cetera
um

01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
i i'm concerned that are you being asked
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
to ensure that these kids keep these
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
mass on on the bus
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
rather than watching the road and safety
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
issues around you you're now watching
 
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
kids to ensure that their mass are on
 
01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
and are you having to tell them to put
 
01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
the mass on while they're on the bus so
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
we have boxing masks that we give out
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
when the kids approach the bus because a
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
lot of them don't have masks at the bus
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
stops so they give them to us um i don't
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
know how much they're enforcing it but
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
i've been very cautious of not
 
01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
participating in that part so if the
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
kids come up i hope i hold the clean
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
mask for them to take and if they want
 
01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
it most of the kids are just they learn
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
from school to wear masks so if you go
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
to pick up run at school 100 of the kids
 
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
walk on the bus with a mask and they
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
don't question it so i get that part
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
yeah my question is when they're on the
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
bus and let's say a youngster takes a
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
mask off
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
are you required a lot of bus drivers
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
definitely do reprimands you are told to
 
01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
tell them to get the mass back on
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
i don't they're not then we're not
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
penalized if we don't so i just went
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
with that as my my i offer the masks and
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
then it's up to them but we're supposed
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
to still pick up kids if they don't have
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
masks and they won't wear them and then
 
01:54:56.709 --> 01:54:56.719 align:start position:0%
the school deals with them at their
 
01:54:56.719 --> 01:54:58.149 align:start position:0%
the school deals with them at their
level

01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
we're more focused on the road
 
01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i hope so
 
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
represent hobson
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
being here your testimony was very
 
01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:07.990 align:start position:0%
being here your testimony was very
powerful

01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
powerful
 
01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
i had not uh thought of the burden that
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
that puts on you
 
01:55:15.030 --> 01:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
as a bus driver to make sure
 
01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:15.990 align:start position:0%
as a bus driver to make sure
that

01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
the right person is picking up a child
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
off of the bus
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
do you believe it's a matter of time
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
before something
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
really scary happens i mean we've
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
definitely had children not being able
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
to be identified that were on the buses
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
so even that kids getting on the wrong
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
bus at the beginning of the year was
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
all the time i mean now it's been more
 
01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
steady but if kids wanted to go on a
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
different bus we can only identify them
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
from two inches on their face
 
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
so it's just it's just gonna happen for
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%

with it please thank you
 
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%

god
 
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
um go to a private school two different
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
private schools
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i fought
 
01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
very hard with those private schools to
 
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
prevent masking from becoming a
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
requirement there so to date praise god
 
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
my children have not worn a mask one
 
01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:37.270 align:start position:0%
my children have not worn a mask one
time

01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
not in public not anywhere they've never
 
01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
worn one and i am so grateful for that
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
um i want and i'm doing this i i started
 
01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
the organization because i want other
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
people's children to have that same
 
01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:51.189 align:start position:0%
people's children to have that same
right

01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
it's not a privilege it's a right to be
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
able to breathe god's clean air that he
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
made for us
 
01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
and as a matter of fact
 
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
the rest of my testimony i'll read the
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
last line of this because that's the
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
part that's that's relevant therefore we
 
01:58:07.109 --> 01:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
the undersigned hereby ask that the
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
house pass legislation to ban facial
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
covering mandates for students in all
 
01:58:13.750 --> 01:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
public schools in new hampshire
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm here for that's what
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
you know both of these bills we support
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
we support any effort whatsoever to
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
prevent local school districts
 
01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:24.550 align:start position:0%
prevent local school districts
from

01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
requiring masks on on children for all
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
the reasons you heard today
 
01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
and we also i i would submit to you
 
01:58:35.189 --> 01:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
personally that i do not believe in
 
01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:36.639 align:start position:0%
local control
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is not a home rule state
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
we have a state legislature that is very
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative of people of the whole
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
state and we have uniform laws
 
01:58:48.070 --> 01:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the whole state so you don't
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
have to go from one town to another and
 
01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
check the law books
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
we should be able to go from one town to
 
01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
another and know what the law is because
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
the state has put it in place and the
 
01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
government's role is in fact to protect
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
the people's individual liberty that is
 
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
the number one reason why we have
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
government at all individual liberty
 
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
protection that's your job
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
and i did it once so i appreciate it
 
01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:11.750 align:start position:0%
and i did it once so i appreciate it
um

01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:12.629 align:start position:0%
um
now

01:59:12.629 --> 01:59:12.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
i i guess
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
to that point i would say that the
 
01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
governor has has made a announcement
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
that you know many people might say well
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
now we don't need this
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and i would submit to you that the
 
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
opposite is in fact true um we we very
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
much need to pass this legislation to
 
01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:30.629 align:start position:0%
much need to pass this legislation to
prevent

01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
in the future these local
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh government authorities
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
that don't have the authority from
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
putting in place these these types of
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
mass mandates on our children
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
we have the right to breathe oxygen we
 
01:59:48.149 --> 01:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
have the right to show the image of god
 
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
that he made for us to each other
 
01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
and i would submit to you that a mask
 
01:59:53.679 --> 01:59:54.709 align:start position:0%
and i would submit to you that a mask
um

01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
is an occult symbol
 
01:59:58.950 --> 01:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
and and and we're what we're facing
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
right here is literally a religious
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
spiritual battle between
 
02:00:05.910 --> 02:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
the forces of darkness and the forces of
 
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
light god made us in his image this is
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
his image you all have his image on you
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
and i pray to you
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
that you allow our children to show
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
god's image thank you thank you very
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
much andrew are there any questions from
 
02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:23.030 align:start position:0%
the committee
yes

02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting anybody that wears a
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
mask is a force of evil
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
i think that's a ridiculous statement
 
02:00:31.030 --> 02:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to answer it
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to follow through on
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
what you said that mask said i didn't
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
say what you said
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
i'm asking that's to me the logical next
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
step i'm asking if that's what you
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
believe because it's not the logical
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
next step it's an absolutely ludicrous
 
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
thing to say
 
02:00:46.709 --> 02:00:46.719 align:start position:0%
okay let's let's move on here okay thank
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any other
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:55.990 --> 02:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
um oh so i'd like one of these to go
 
02:01:01.070 --> 02:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
with the permanent record of
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay melissa you got me with your name
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%

thank you for seeing me thank you for
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
doing this we appreciate it
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
i spent hours and hours and hours of
 
02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:31.669 align:start position:0%
i spent hours and hours and hours of
research

02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to present it to you too
 
02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
you know i might like just give it to
 
02:01:38.070 --> 02:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
you i highlighted everything so you
 
02:01:38.950 --> 02:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
don't have to read through all the
 
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
documents just read through the
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
highlighted things to make it easier
 
02:01:42.719 --> 02:01:44.229 align:start position:0%
highlighted things to make it easier
um

02:01:44.229 --> 02:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
hi my name is melissa konomakas and i'm
 
02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
in support of hp 1131 to prohibit
 
02:01:51.669 --> 02:01:51.679 align:start position:0%
schools whether public or private from
 
02:01:53.669 --> 02:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
creating policies that force students or
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
members of the public to wear mass
 
02:01:58.870 --> 02:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
some people may believe in the train
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
theory and some may believe in the germ
 
02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
theory i will speak on the premises that
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
viruses are what are what makes people
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
sick and present to you
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
that mass do more harm than good and
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
that they don't work
 
02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
first of all when people speak sing or
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
laugh they they eject saliva from their
 
02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
mouth which i know you might be all
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
thinking well all the more reason to
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
wear masks right
 
02:02:22.149 --> 02:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
um but i'll get to that the argument
 
02:02:22.159 --> 02:02:23.030 align:start position:0%
um but i'll get to that the argument
later

02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
later
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%

more exhaled droplets become trapped in
 
02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
the masks
 
02:02:44.830 --> 02:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
and the damp masks cause the bacteria to
 
02:02:47.430 --> 02:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
proliferate which turns
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
which in turn is being inhaled into the
 
02:02:49.599 --> 02:02:51.430 align:start position:0%
which in turn is being inhaled into the
lungs

people are inhibiting their oxygen
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
intake which lowers their oxygen levels
 
02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:12.719 align:start position:0%
in their blood
 
02:04:15.189 --> 02:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
and rebreathing in their co2 which
 
02:04:17.589 --> 02:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
raises co2 levels in their blood causing
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
their bodies to become more acidic
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
please see the articles mass are harmful
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
i won't read all the articles because of
 
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
any time but
 
02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
i wrote them in there moreover
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
scientists have found toxic chemicals in
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
the face mask such as formaldehyde and
 
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%

02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
there are over 70 000 new companies now
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
registered to manufacture and sell mass
 
02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
in china and according to the general
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
product safety regulations as mass
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
covering face coverings are not medical
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
devices and they do not regulate these
 
02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.830 align:start position:0%
devices and they do not regulate these
products

02:04:53.830 --> 02:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
there have been numerous studies that
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
have been performed by doctors and
 
02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
scientists which show mass are
 
02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:00.629 align:start position:0%
scientists which show mass are
ineffective

02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
ineffective
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm not even going to go into the
 
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
poor sizes or anything like that
 
02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:06.390 align:start position:0%
poor sizes or anything like that
um

02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
unless you've gone beyond your time so
 
02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have to wrap it up here
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
please okay
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
um anyway there's lots of studies in
 
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
here that show that
 
02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
mass don't work
 
02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:18.229 align:start position:0%
mass don't work
um

02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
when we when we speak
 
02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:22.069 align:start position:0%
when we when we speak
um

02:05:22.069 --> 02:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
the mass gets moisture on there
 
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
the damp mass causes less air
 
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
permeability so it will limit how much
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
viral particles is able to hold and it
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
said it's only 20 minutes before the
 
02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:38.149 align:start position:0%
said it's only 20 minutes before the
mass

02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
mass
 
02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
become damp
 
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
um and back in march 2020
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists and inspectors disease
 
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
experts were at the pains to emphasize
 
02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
against the unwarranted scramble for
 
02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:49.350 align:start position:0%
against the unwarranted scramble for
masks

02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
masks
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
so back then they were saying um the
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
surgeon general jerome adams said
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
seriously people stop buying mass unless
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to try and wrap
 
02:06:00.310 --> 02:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
that up quickly here okay we have more
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
people who want to speak here okay i'm
 
02:06:04.629 --> 02:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
sorry well you can um
 
02:06:06.310 --> 02:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
be the rest of it then i guess we'll we
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
will look at all this stuff i really
 
02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate you looking at it because i
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
spent hours
 
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
any questions why we're here to hear
 
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
from you and then look at the
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
information that's provided to us so we
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank you are there
 
02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
02:06:22.639 --> 02:06:24.229 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much
 
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
if you could bring that over to julius
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
or or to oliver and they will make sure
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
it gets up here and it will be
 
02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
submitted thank you
 
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh alexandra
 
02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:40.069 align:start position:0%
uh alexandra
uh

02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:40.079 --> 02:06:45.830 align:start position:0%
uh
manila

02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
this is alexander
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
alex yeah you can call me alex that's
 
02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:51.990 align:start position:0%
alex yeah you can call me alex that's
fine

02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for giving me the time
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
to talk to you all about masks and you
 
02:06:58.149 --> 02:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
know i think we're all tired of it i
 
02:06:59.910 --> 02:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
know i'm pretty tired of it but like
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
there's still people willing to come out
 
02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
in a blizzard
 
02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
to discuss this and kind of fight back
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
on it so it's pretty serious and
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's not going to get resolved because
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
you have two groups of people who
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
completely disagree with each other
 
02:07:13.990 --> 02:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
right and
 
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
forcing one group to bend to the other
 
02:07:18.069 --> 02:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
group's will is not the solution right
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
so when you pass laws and the school
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
board passes mandates and
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
the cdc says one thing right it's it's
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
not going to work out the the best way
 
02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
to solve the only way to solve this
 
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
is to realize that
 
02:07:33.030 --> 02:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
our rights
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
belong to the individual right we have a
 
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
right to make
 
02:07:38.229 --> 02:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
choices for our children and for
 
02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
ourselves for our own help going to
 
02:07:43.109 --> 02:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
something else here uh i have experience
 
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
as a former environmental health and
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
safety specialist
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
for a utility company in new york city i
 
02:07:50.550 --> 02:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
worked there for 12 years and i'm still
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
in that same industry so i have 14 years
 
02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:53.830 align:start position:0%
in that same industry so i have 14 years
total

02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
total
 
02:07:56.790 --> 02:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
experience working with osha regulations
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
one of my roles in the past was
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
selecting personal protective equipment
 
02:08:02.069 --> 02:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
for industrial work which included the
 
02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
use of respirators
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
respirators are used to protect against
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
airborne contaminants
 
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
obviously today there's been an official
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
claim that there are tiny airborne virus
 
02:08:14.069 --> 02:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
particles floating all around the earth
 
02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
threatening the life on planet earth
 
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
right and this claim is made without any
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
evidence whatsoever now you're going to
 
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
point to positive pcr tests
 
02:08:25.350 --> 02:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations deaths i understand
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
that but none of these things are
 
02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:30.079 align:start position:0%
evidence of contaminated air or the need
 
02:08:34.069 --> 02:08:34.079 align:start position:0%
for the use of a respirator 24 7.
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
has anyone seen an air sample for sars
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
cove too
 
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
if we took an air sample in this room
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
right now would would someone be able to
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
show me the presence of sars cove 2 and
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
tell me that my life was in jeopardy
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
um or are we just comfortable going off
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
of wmur's case counter
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's what we've been doing
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
anyway before employing a respirator
 
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
the first step would be to prove the
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
existence of a hazardous atmosphere so
 
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
that we could know which type of
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
respirator would be appropriate to use
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
now our atmosphere is hazardous but it's
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
not for coronavirus it's because of poor
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
environmental practices in favor of
 
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
profit uh dumping fluoride into our
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
water supply and we're also marinating
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
in cell tower radiation but nobody wants
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
to talk about that so
 
02:09:18.629 --> 02:09:18.639 align:start position:0%
that's just like god intended it that
 
02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
stuff aside the first step is perv it
 
02:09:23.109 --> 02:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
which no one has done
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
after we proved it we would need to
 
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
select an appropriate respirator the
 
02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
purpose of a paper medical mask is to
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
prevent bacteria from contaminating
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
medically sterile environments
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
these masks do not protect you from
 
02:09:36.149 --> 02:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
supposed viruses floating in the air
 
02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
because they do not provide an airtight
 
02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:39.030 align:start position:0%
because they do not provide an airtight
seal

02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
seal
 
02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
i'll continue and then
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
just think of this before 2020 when you
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
went to visit your doctor for cold or
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
flu did any of you wear a mask in front
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
of your doctor did your doctor wear a
 
02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:54.390 align:start position:0%
of your doctor did your doctor wear a
mask

02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
mask
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
why is that
 
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
because that's not how this works that's
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
not how your immune system works
 
02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
we have an immune system i'll finish up
 
02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
quickly we have an immune system that
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
generally functions very well and
 
02:10:07.109 --> 02:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
sustains many years of life i think the
 
02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
average life expectancy in america is
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
like high 70s here so it's pretty good
 
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
just on natural immunity
 
02:10:15.189 --> 02:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
nothing changed in 2020 except our
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
perception of alleged viruses in our
 
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
health thanks to the hysterical media
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
and hysterical leadership
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
and then last thing once we select an
 
02:10:24.629 --> 02:10:24.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate respirator that can provide
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
an airtight seal by osha's standard 29
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
cfr 1910 which i've brought with me and
 
02:10:31.750 --> 02:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'll share with you all a doctor needs
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
to evaluate the person donning a
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
respirator to make sure they're
 
02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
medically fit to put something over
 
02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
their face that inhibits breathing
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
once they're cleared again according to
 
02:10:42.310 --> 02:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
osha a respirator fit test must be
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
performed to test the seal and you have
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
to do a positive and negative pressure
 
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
test we don't do that in schools
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
children are not doing this so osha
 
02:10:52.069 --> 02:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
standards went out the window along with
 
02:10:54.310 --> 02:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
common sense and years of common medical
 
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge government solution has just
 
02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
been to do something just do something
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
to create a show of doing something uh
 
02:11:02.229 --> 02:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
even if it's not effective or only
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
creates an illusion of safety uh we're
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
done with that the the jig is up here
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
this can never be allowed to happen
 
02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
again so
 
02:11:14.069 --> 02:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
i support this bill and the next one
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
and we just we demand that you guys just
 
02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
step out of the way and let us manage
 
02:11:18.550 --> 02:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
our own health and health of our our
 
02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:20.790 align:start position:0%
our own health and health of our our
children

02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
you guys have no authority the school
 
02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
boards have no authority to dictate what
 
02:11:25.589 --> 02:11:25.599 align:start position:0%
medical treatment
 
02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
um we we do for our children and that it
 
02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what beth daley says or
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
what ben chan says or the cdc belongs to
 
02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:33.350 align:start position:0%
what ben chan says or the cdc belongs to
us

02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
and i want to thank you for your time
 
02:11:36.550 --> 02:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much alex kind of hoping
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
that the average lifespan was in the 80s
 
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll take 78. it rounds up
 
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
that gives me a couple years
 
02:11:47.109 --> 02:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much are there any uh
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing ants thank you okay thank you
 
02:11:53.430 --> 02:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for battling against
 
02:11:56.069 --> 02:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
mother nature out there
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
so three minutes um that's a little hard
 
02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
and i
 
02:12:19.109 --> 02:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
could talk for this for on hours but i'm
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
actually i wasn't going to speak on this
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
personally but i am
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
my kids have always been in in private
 
02:12:25.599 --> 02:12:26.870 align:start position:0%
my kids have always been in in private
school

02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:12:28.950 --> 02:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
except for
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
the year that the school year that cobot
 
02:12:31.119 --> 02:12:32.310 align:start position:0%
the year that the school year that cobot
hit

02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
hit
 
02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:33.189 align:start position:0%
hit
and

02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
we saw a lot of things and um
 
02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
school shut down
 
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
and then we were like wow that was a
 
02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:40.709 align:start position:0%
and then we were like wow that was a
mistake

02:12:40.709 --> 02:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
it was a mistake from a lot of things
 
02:12:43.350 --> 02:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
that we saw
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
in the public schools and
 
02:12:45.119 --> 02:12:46.550 align:start position:0%
in the public schools and
um

02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
and so we basically decided okay well
 
02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're you know come
 
02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:52.069 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're you know come
september

02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
september
 
02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
school's gonna be open we're gonna go
 
02:12:56.790 --> 02:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
back to a private school that we were at
 
02:12:58.229 --> 02:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
the grass wasn't greener there
 
02:13:03.189 --> 02:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
my daughter my oldest daughter
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
has had in
 
02:13:07.350 --> 02:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
a diagnosed anxiety
 
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosis since she was three
 
02:13:11.589 --> 02:13:11.599 align:start position:0%
she can't wear a mask
 
02:13:11.599 --> 02:13:12.390 align:start position:0%
she can't wear a mask
so

02:13:12.390 --> 02:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
this is when my
 
02:13:17.109 --> 02:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
whole process started so she was a
 
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
patient at dartmouth-hitchcock
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
pediatrician

02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
pediatrician
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
that there's no one in the state that
 
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
would give a medical exemption
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
for my child they had been treating her
 
02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
for 10 years they knew everything about
 
02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:35.189 align:start position:0%
for 10 years they knew everything about
her

02:13:35.189 --> 02:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
her
 
02:13:38.229 --> 02:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
they knew she had some adhd stuff as but
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
her main thing was her anxiety
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
and they just ignored that and so when i
 
02:13:43.679 --> 02:13:46.470 align:start position:0%
and they just ignored that and so when i
demanded

02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
an exemption from her
 
02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
they basically said
 
02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
they gave me a letter that said well
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
we'll train her
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
how to wear a mask
 
02:13:58.149 --> 02:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
everything with this whole thing is just
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
disgusting there's no such thing as
 
02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
as disabilities anymore there's no such
 
02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
thing as as any of it
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
this was carmella's at the time
 
02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
um my daughter her
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
her therapist
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
so they said go go to her therapist to
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
get an exemption you can't get one from
 
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
a therapist in this date as well
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
number one so i said i just want to
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
document all the following issues
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
before the appointment today
 
02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
carmel has diagnosed anxiety and adhd
 
02:14:31.109 --> 02:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
she's got an iep
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
carmella's blood pressure becomes highly
 
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
elevated immediately when she puts on a
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
mask wearing a mask is detrimental to
 
02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
her mental health and well-being
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
my daughters had two doctor appointments
 
02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
where her blood pressure was not able to
 
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
be taken because it was too high to
 
02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:46.870 align:start position:0%
be taken because it was too high to
measure

02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
measure
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
the minute she put on a mask it went off
 
02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
the charts
 
02:14:53.189 --> 02:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
they actually had to take the mask off
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
for her to get even an elevated blood
 
02:14:58.229 --> 02:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
pressure reading
 
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
my daughter says i sweat like a pig when
 
02:15:06.229 --> 02:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
i wear a mask i am so hot i feel
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
suffocated i find it these are all

the ultimate diagnosis was severe
 
02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
anxiety as a result of being forced to
 
02:18:42.309 --> 02:18:42.319 align:start position:0%

right it's not it's not like taking
 
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
medication for a heart attack it's not
 
02:19:05.589 --> 02:19:05.599 align:start position:0%
like taking

are forever she will battle this forever
similar

02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
similar
 
02:19:17.589 --> 02:19:17.599 align:start position:0%
to what some other parents have said
 
02:19:19.830 --> 02:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
my school district was the last to
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
return to school they only returned to
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
public school after the governor
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
mandated it
 
02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
and my daughter wanted to go back to
 
02:19:28.950 --> 02:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
school she wanted to be with her friends
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
she had a choice the choice was to wear
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
a mask or not go to school
 
02:19:36.629 --> 02:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
or go to school wear a mask and get on
 
02:19:38.709 --> 02:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
medication and this is what my daughter
 
02:19:41.429 --> 02:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
chose to do she's on medications that
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
she does not need so that she can
 
02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
tolerate the mask
 
02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
i've been in the icu for a year now i
 
02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
started last year when a couple of
 
02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
nurses had coveted and they were out
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
they needed
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
more nurses so i moved to the icu i've
 
02:19:55.750 --> 02:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
been there for a year i still work in
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%

so i know who gets
 
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
sick from covid it's multiple
 
02:20:07.750 --> 02:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
comorbidities age is a huge risk factor
 
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
kids are not at risk for catching
 
02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
and they're not the primary transmitters
 
02:20:14.309 --> 02:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
of kovid
 
02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
you are harming the least at-risk group
 
02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
of individuals with these mask mandates

02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
it is child abuse
 
02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:30.469 align:start position:0%
it is child abuse
and

02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
i was told to think about another job
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
which i have absolutely thought about
 
02:21:36.150 --> 02:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
and thought about and thought about i
 
02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
will not tell a child to put a mask on
 
02:21:40.389 --> 02:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
their face i still don't
 
02:21:42.469 --> 02:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
but i see it every day
 
02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
because that has been my life
 
02:21:50.309 --> 02:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
and i just see what it's doing to them
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
and it is disgusting
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
an absolute child abuse
 
02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
and that's really all i want to say
 
02:21:58.630 --> 02:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
please pass this bill
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%

02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:02.710 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
i got this last card here and
 
02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:15.429 --> 02:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
if if a person wants to come up and you
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
committee fine are not even paying
 
02:22:26.309 --> 02:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
attention they're reading and eating and
 
02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
and it's not okay
 
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
it's not okay that someone is so afraid
 
02:22:33.349 --> 02:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
to speak because of the because of the
 
02:22:35.670 --> 02:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
way the people are being intimidated
 
02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
that's not okay she wants to speak it'll
 
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
be less than three minutes
 
02:22:42.309 --> 02:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
she's welcome
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
amanda why don't you come on up and
 
02:22:44.319 --> 02:22:45.750 align:start position:0%
amanda why don't you come on up and
speak

02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
and it says before you judge someone for
 
02:23:13.190 --> 02:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
not wearing a mask i ask that you think
 
02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
about a few things
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
imagine that the person resistant to
 
02:23:19.030 --> 02:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask has been held down in a
 
02:23:21.190 --> 02:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
forceful way with a hand over their
 
02:23:23.590 --> 02:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
mouth and nose blocking them from
 
02:23:27.270 --> 02:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
screaming for help and gasping for air
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
imagine the fear that still lives within
 
02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
these people
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
who have survived situations where their
 
02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
voice was minimized and they couldn't
 
02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:36.469 align:start position:0%
voice was minimized and they couldn't
breathe

02:23:36.469 --> 02:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
breathe
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
when you put on your mask
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
are your first thoughts i wonder when
 
02:23:42.150 --> 02:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
the feeling of gasping for air is going
 
02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
to begin this time will it take five
 
02:23:46.630 --> 02:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
minutes or will it take one minute
 
02:23:49.030 --> 02:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
when will the panic set in i wonder when
 
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
i speak if anyone will hear me
 
02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
imagine the feeling of their bodies
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
shutting down
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
as they remember the look
 
02:23:59.910 --> 02:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
in their abusers eyes the flashbacks the
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
sounds the panic and don't forget
 
02:24:04.630 --> 02:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
looking around for someone to save them
 
02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
this is what's happening when trying to
 
02:24:09.270 --> 02:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
get groceries for their family these
 
02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
reminders and this panic
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
let's remember we have no idea what
 
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
anyone around us has been through we can
 
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
only control ourselves and our own
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
bodies you are free to make your own
 
02:24:22.469 --> 02:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
choice and if you have to judge someone
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
else for theirs judge lightly it's heavy
 
02:24:29.190 --> 02:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
very good thanks well done amanda
 
02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
we did linda right
 
02:24:43.439 --> 02:24:46.150 align:start position:0%
we did linda right
yes

02:24:46.150 --> 02:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have any other cards on this
 
02:24:49.270 --> 02:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
bill so we're going to close this
 
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
and we're going to take a a five minute
 
02:24:57.030 --> 02:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
break here some of us have to stretch a
 
02:24:59.190 --> 02:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
little bit and pe teachers tell us
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
stretch and
 
02:39:34.309 --> 02:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:36.550 --> 02:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
because my son wasn't like
 
02:39:39.429 --> 02:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
every other child in that school
 
02:39:41.270 --> 02:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
and as i
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
as i
 
02:39:42.479 --> 02:39:43.670 align:start position:0%
as i
um

02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:46.550 --> 02:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
went through this process i realized
 
02:39:48.389 --> 02:39:48.399 align:start position:0%
that all children
 
02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
are very unique and all children are
 
02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
very individual
 
02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:54.150 align:start position:0%
very individual
um

02:39:54.150 --> 02:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:55.750 --> 02:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:39:58.230 --> 02:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
covet hit us
 
02:40:00.630 --> 02:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
and the mass mandates came out and they
 
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
wanted basks and you know
 
02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
stores and
 
02:40:08.309 --> 02:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
mass and everywhere
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
and my son hated it
 
02:40:12.389 --> 02:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
he's still at my house and he hated it
 
02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
we spent years teaching him how to read
 
02:40:16.550 --> 02:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
facial expressions
 
02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
so he could understand
 
02:40:21.990 --> 02:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:24.070 --> 02:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
and so he hated masks
 
02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
and i heard a lot about that
 
02:40:29.429 --> 02:40:29.439 align:start position:0%
but what was worse is i i saw other
 
02:40:31.750 --> 02:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
children that hated them i saw other
 
02:40:34.710 --> 02:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
adults that hated them
 
02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i saw a split in our society
 
02:40:41.349 --> 02:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:44.469 --> 02:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
and i saw the behavior
 
02:40:47.429 --> 02:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
that each of us have toward each other
 
02:40:54.230 --> 02:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:56.950 --> 02:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
and what really pushed me on this bill
 
02:40:58.389 --> 02:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
was when i saw
 
02:40:58.399 --> 02:40:59.590 align:start position:0%
was when i saw
adults

02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
adults
 
02:41:01.750 --> 02:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
yelling at children
 
02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
and telling the children
 
02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
that they didn't care about their
 
02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:08.070 align:start position:0%
that they didn't care about their
friends

02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
friends
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
if they weren't wearing a mask that they
 
02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to kill their friends if they're
 
02:41:13.990 --> 02:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask
 
02:41:16.550 --> 02:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
and i was like wait what are we doing
 
02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
what are we doing as people
 
02:41:23.269 --> 02:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
is this the society we want
 
02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
is what we're gaining
 
02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
worth it
 
02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
now this last bill that we just heard
 
02:41:31.030 --> 02:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
you heard a lot of the
 
02:41:33.349 --> 02:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
pluses or minuses of mass and the
 
02:41:36.710 --> 02:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
arguments are out there for both sides
 
02:41:38.309 --> 02:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
but i'm not going to do that today i'm
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
not going to sit here and try to make
 
02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
that argument with you i'm going to make
 
02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
an argument for a couple of things
 
02:41:45.670 --> 02:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
and they're the things this bill is
 
02:41:47.510 --> 02:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
hoping to address
 
02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:48.950 align:start position:0%
hoping to address
um

02:41:48.950 --> 02:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
and there may be some work i need to do
 
02:41:53.269 --> 02:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
on it still
 
02:41:55.910 --> 02:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
the first thing is who's the best person
 
02:41:58.070 --> 02:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
to make a decision
 
02:42:02.309 --> 02:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
about a mask choice for the child
 
02:42:04.630 --> 02:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
is it the governor
 
02:42:07.269 --> 02:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
does he know my child the best
 
02:42:08.309 --> 02:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
is it
 
02:42:11.830 --> 02:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:15.910 --> 02:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:17.830 --> 02:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
elected folks that we put on our school
 
02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:19.510 align:start position:0%
elected folks that we put on our school
boards

02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
boards
 
02:42:21.910 --> 02:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
do they know my child the best
 
02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
is it the school
 
02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
or is it the parent themselves
 
02:42:28.309 --> 02:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
 
02:42:31.670 --> 02:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
that i had a great iep team i had great
 
02:42:33.830 --> 02:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
people working with me with my son
 
02:42:35.990 --> 02:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you for a fact not one of
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
them knows my son as well as i do
 
02:42:41.590 --> 02:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
not a single one
 
02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:42.710 align:start position:0%
not a single one
so

02:42:42.710 --> 02:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:44.630 --> 02:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
as we look at things
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
we tend to say we need a solution and we
 
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
need a fast solution and in doing that
 
02:42:52.389 --> 02:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
we say let's have a broad brush solution
 
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
because it's the easiest and fastest to
 
02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:55.510 align:start position:0%
because it's the easiest and fastest to
employ

02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
employ
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
one size fits all
 
02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with kids one size does
 
02:43:03.110 --> 02:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
not fit all
 
02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:03.910 align:start position:0%
not fit all
so

02:43:03.910 --> 02:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:43:06.630 --> 02:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
i wrote this bill to say hey
 
02:43:09.030 --> 02:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's best
 
02:43:11.550 --> 02:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
unless you can show some really
 
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
significant value
 
02:43:18.630 --> 02:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
in a blanket solution i think it's best
 
02:43:20.790 --> 02:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
if the parent that understands that
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
child the best and that child's
 
02:43:25.670 --> 02:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
individual needs individual physiology
 
02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
works with the doctors looks at the
 
02:43:30.150 --> 02:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
evidence they certainly have the passion
 
02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
to i mean
 
02:43:32.710 --> 02:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
look at the people we have here today
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
that came through a snow storm to talk
 
02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
to you about it so they've got the
 
02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:39.510 align:start position:0%
to you about it so they've got the
passion

02:43:39.510 --> 02:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
passion
 
02:43:41.670 --> 02:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
to do all that work do school boards
 
02:43:43.349 --> 02:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
have that passion were their school
 
02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
board members
 
02:43:45.990 --> 02:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
shuffling through things trying to
 
02:43:47.990 --> 02:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
figure out each individual child i don't
 
02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
think so
 
02:43:51.030 --> 02:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
02:43:55.110 --> 02:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
the best bet is to let the parents do it
 
02:43:56.790 --> 02:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:43:58.469 --> 02:43:58.479 align:start position:0%
the other thing i wanted this bill to
 
02:43:58.479 --> 02:44:00.389 align:start position:0%
the other thing i wanted this bill to
address

02:44:00.389 --> 02:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:44:00.399 --> 02:44:02.870 align:start position:0%
address
is

02:44:02.870 --> 02:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
how we treat people after they've made
 
02:44:07.269 --> 02:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
that decision
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
so we have some folks that decide to
 
02:44:11.269 --> 02:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
wear masks today and some folks that
 
02:44:11.279 --> 02:44:12.630 align:start position:0%
wear masks today and some folks that
don't

02:44:12.630 --> 02:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:44:14.389 --> 02:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
should we all be treating each other the
 
02:44:14.399 --> 02:44:17.110 align:start position:0%
should we all be treating each other the
same

02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:19.269 --> 02:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
should i treat these folks badly because
 
02:44:21.190 --> 02:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
they don't have a mask or these folks
 
02:44:23.429 --> 02:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
badly because they do
 
02:44:26.150 --> 02:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
i don't believe we should
 
02:44:29.190 --> 02:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
and so i sought with this to say hey we
 
02:44:32.230 --> 02:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
need to treat
 
02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:33.670 align:start position:0%
need to treat
harassment

02:44:33.670 --> 02:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
harassment
 
02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:35.110 align:start position:0%
harassment
shaming

02:44:35.110 --> 02:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
shaming
 
02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:36.150 align:start position:0%
shaming
okay

02:44:36.150 --> 02:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
on masks
 
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
we need to treat that with the same zero
 
02:44:44.630 --> 02:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
tolerance policy we treat bullying with
 
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
we already have metrics in our school
 
02:44:48.070 --> 02:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
systems for
 
02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:50.550 align:start position:0%
you know
um

02:44:50.550 --> 02:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
how to deal with with folks that bully
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay why not apply those same metrics
 
02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:00.550 align:start position:0%
okay why not apply those same metrics
to

02:45:00.550 --> 02:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:45:02.230 --> 02:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
folks that
 
02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
harass or
 
02:45:06.309 --> 02:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
shame people on their mass choice
 
02:45:08.309 --> 02:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
regardless of what that choice is i i
 
02:45:10.630 --> 02:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
really don't care
 
02:45:13.190 --> 02:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
um and so that's what i'm seeking to do
 
02:45:14.870 --> 02:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
they wanted to make sure
 
02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:17.990 align:start position:0%
they wanted to make sure
that

02:45:17.990 --> 02:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:20.389 --> 02:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
the schools weren't responsible for
 
02:45:22.870 --> 02:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
tracking everybody's masking choice if
 
02:45:24.469 --> 02:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
the parents are going to make the choice
 
02:45:28.070 --> 02:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
it that makes a lot of sense
 
02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
but how does a school
 
02:45:31.750 --> 02:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
know which child is supposed to be
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask and which one isn't and
 
02:45:35.830 --> 02:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
so i want to make sure that it's in
 
02:45:37.670 --> 02:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
writing that the schools aren't
 
02:45:39.910 --> 02:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for that
 
02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
that the parent makes the choice
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
and the parent talks to the child and
 
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
makes sure that sure that the child is
 
02:45:49.030 --> 02:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
doing what the parent wishes
 
02:45:50.469 --> 02:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
that the schools don't even have to
 
02:45:52.389 --> 02:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
think about whether that child needs a
 
02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
master that one doesn't
 
02:45:58.870 --> 02:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:00.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:03.190 --> 02:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's not the school bus drivers
 
02:46:04.870 --> 02:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
as i saw in the previous testament it's
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
not the school bus driver's
 
02:46:08.550 --> 02:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make sure
 
02:46:11.110 --> 02:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
let's see john's supposed to be but uh
 
02:46:13.190 --> 02:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
bobby's not
 
02:46:15.349 --> 02:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay this is on this
 
02:46:15.359 --> 02:46:17.269 align:start position:0%
okay this is on this
um

02:46:17.269 --> 02:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
so if there's other issues that you guys
 
02:46:21.830 --> 02:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
see that you want to have addressed i'll
 
02:46:24.309 --> 02:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
be glad to hear from you and see what i
 
02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
can do to to get that done
 
02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:28.630 align:start position:0%
can do to to get that done
um

02:46:28.630 --> 02:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:31.110 --> 02:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
and other than that i
 
02:46:32.790 --> 02:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
i really do
 
02:46:34.630 --> 02:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
wish again to thank all the people that
 
02:46:37.030 --> 02:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
showed up this was a tremendous i mean
 
02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's a tremendous effort in a storm
 
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
like the one we're having right now
 
02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:41.910 align:start position:0%
like the one we're having right now
so

02:46:41.910 --> 02:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:46:43.349 --> 02:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and i'll take
 
02:46:44.389 --> 02:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions from
 
02:46:48.870 --> 02:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:46:51.590 --> 02:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
02:46:55.110 --> 02:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:06.550 --> 02:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:08.389 --> 02:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm bob dybrowski i'm from
 
02:47:10.469 --> 02:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
candia new hampshire
 
02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to start right at the top
 
02:47:15.349 --> 02:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
and give you my biggest point first and
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
i'm going to make this real fast so
 
02:47:19.030 --> 02:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
don't worry and then talk about
 
02:47:21.349 --> 02:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit of the detail
 
02:47:24.710 --> 02:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
rsa 358
 
02:47:29.030 --> 02:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
is a very important law in new hampshire
 
02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:30.070 align:start position:0%
is a very important law in new hampshire
it

02:47:30.070 --> 02:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
it is the consumer protection laws it is
 
02:47:37.030 --> 02:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:39.990 --> 02:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
for use for virus protection fake mass
 
02:47:41.830 --> 02:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
if the mass doesn't have a filter in it
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
you cannot sell it for virus protection
 
02:47:46.870 --> 02:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
you cannot label it under rsa 358 you
 
02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
can't package it you cannot advertise it
 
02:47:50.469 --> 02:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
you cannot post it on the internet for
 
02:47:52.469 --> 02:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
that use you can't put it on a display
 
02:47:55.830 --> 02:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
rack in your store it's illegal
 
02:47:57.510 --> 02:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
what we have here is a very peculiar
 
02:47:59.190 --> 02:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
situation where school boards are saying
 
02:48:01.750 --> 02:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
well hey we're not selling the mass
 
02:48:03.110 --> 02:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
we're just forcing the kids to wear the
 
02:48:04.469 --> 02:48:04.479 align:start position:0%
mask that doesn't work and doesn't have
 
02:48:06.790 --> 02:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
a filter in it
 
02:48:08.150 --> 02:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
there's nothing wrong with that we never
 
02:48:09.990 --> 02:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
sold it
 
02:48:11.670 --> 02:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
no no that
 
02:48:13.750 --> 02:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's untenable
 
02:48:15.670 --> 02:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
the notion that you're not selling the
 
02:48:15.680 --> 02:48:17.110 align:start position:0%
the notion that you're not selling the
mask

02:48:17.110 --> 02:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
mask
 
02:48:19.030 --> 02:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
therefore you have the right to force
 
02:48:21.750 --> 02:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
someone to wear that same fake mask that
 
02:48:23.830 --> 02:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
is outrageous
 
02:48:26.230 --> 02:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is so easy it's so simple i
 
02:48:27.910 --> 02:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
don't know how it i mean this ought to
 
02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:29.349 align:start position:0%
don't know how it i mean this ought to
pass

02:48:29.349 --> 02:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:48:32.309 --> 02:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
i you know 100 percent vote
 
02:48:34.630 --> 02:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
all this bill does
 
02:48:37.110 --> 02:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
is it stops somebody primarily from
 
02:48:39.510 --> 02:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
wearing fake masks almost all children
 
02:48:42.150 --> 02:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire wear fake masks with no
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
filters in them i have some at my chair
 
02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
i can show them to you if you wish you
 
02:48:48.389 --> 02:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
can cut them open shake them there's
 
02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
nothing in there
 
02:48:51.190 --> 02:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
they're empty
 
02:48:52.790 --> 02:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
nobody here almost everybody here i'm
 
02:48:54.230 --> 02:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
going to guess drove here in a car
 
02:48:55.750 --> 02:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
nobody brings their car to the auto
 
02:48:58.070 --> 02:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
dealer and says hey unscrew the filter
 
02:49:00.070 --> 02:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
canister for me but don't put a can
 
02:49:01.830 --> 02:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
don't put a filter in there i just want
 
02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
i just want an oil change without that
 
02:49:04.550 --> 02:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
filter just charge me for it but don't
 
02:49:06.790 --> 02:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
put the filter nobody would do that you
 
02:49:09.269 --> 02:49:09.279 align:start position:0%
get an actual filter element when you
 
02:49:11.269 --> 02:49:11.279 align:start position:0%
get your oil change in your car
 
02:49:13.590 --> 02:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
but the children are wearing fake masks
 
02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
with no filters in them
 
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
and then the people say geez i wonder
 
02:49:18.070 --> 02:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
why they don't work well that's why they
 
02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
don't work
 
02:49:20.870 --> 02:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
they're not supposed to work
 
02:49:22.389 --> 02:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
it even says
 
02:49:23.830 --> 02:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know people
 
02:49:26.150 --> 02:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
people got all hung up on studies today
 
02:49:29.030 --> 02:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
and fine studies i believe in studies
 
02:49:30.550 --> 02:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
but you don't even have to bother with
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
studies you can just go right on the cdc
 
02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
website it's right here i just printed
 
02:49:35.830 --> 02:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
it off this morning
 
02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
it says right here
 
02:49:39.910 --> 02:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
does not provide protection for airborne
 
02:49:42.389 --> 02:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
particles not considered respiratory
 
02:49:44.550 --> 02:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
protection what are the kids wearing the
 
02:49:46.309 --> 02:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
surgical mask that doesn't provide
 
02:49:46.319 --> 02:49:49.030 align:start position:0%
surgical mask that doesn't provide
protection

02:49:49.030 --> 02:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:51.830 --> 02:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's outrageous to me
 
02:49:53.429 --> 02:49:53.439 align:start position:0%
if you want a site to study you want to
 
02:49:55.670 --> 02:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
play that game sure go on to a different
 
02:49:59.349 --> 02:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
cdc page right here
 
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
was not statistically significant for
 
02:50:04.870 --> 02:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
cloth mass oops they did the study come
 
02:50:06.230 --> 02:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
to find out
 
02:50:08.790 --> 02:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
there was more negative
 
02:50:11.590 --> 02:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me more positive tests for the
 
02:50:13.510 --> 02:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
cloth mass wearers
 
02:50:15.030 --> 02:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
more people got sick wearing the fake
 
02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:16.070 align:start position:0%
more people got sick wearing the fake
mess

02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
mess
 
02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
this is on the cdc website you can just
 
02:50:20.790 --> 02:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
ignore all of the all of the fog of well
 
02:50:22.630 --> 02:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
this study and this this country and
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
china and everything no
 
02:50:26.309 --> 02:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
you just go right to the city said what
 
02:50:29.190 --> 02:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
cdc website says right there in fact
 
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
the prevalence of fake mass is so severe
 
02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
that they also have that on the cdc
 
02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
website you can't make this up
 
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
counterfeit respirators
 
02:50:42.309 --> 02:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
it is so prevalent they actually have a
 
02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
special page and you could just get the
 
02:50:45.590 --> 02:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
down button page and just page and page
 
02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
and page and they show hundreds of masks
 
02:50:49.590 --> 02:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
that are faked it's unbelievable
 
02:50:51.510 --> 02:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's unbelievable
 
02:50:56.710 --> 02:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:58.469 --> 02:50:58.479 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm going to be real fast so
 
02:51:00.389 --> 02:51:00.399 align:start position:0%
children children can't wear an n95
 
02:51:02.230 --> 02:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
there are no n95s in the united states
 
02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
for children and iosh won't certify them
 
02:51:07.349 --> 02:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
kids do not work around asbestos lead
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's when n95s are primarily made for
 
02:51:11.830 --> 02:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
so you can't even get an n95 certified
 
02:51:14.150 --> 02:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
mask for a child they don't exist so
 
02:51:16.309 --> 02:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
again i'd like you to look at rsa
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
358 and look at this in the context of
 
02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's illegal to sell these mass in new
 
02:51:24.550 --> 02:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire to label market etc for virus
 
02:51:27.190 --> 02:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
protection how could you a school board
 
02:51:29.030 --> 02:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
even dare
 
02:51:30.550 --> 02:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
to force a kid to wear that mask that's
 
02:51:32.389 --> 02:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
illegal to be sold for that purpose
 
02:51:33.990 --> 02:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
02:51:39.910 --> 02:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:48.389 --> 02:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:50.469 --> 02:51:50.479 align:start position:0%

02:51:59.429 --> 02:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
for it earlier
 
02:52:01.269 --> 02:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to add to what i mentioned
 
02:52:01.279 --> 02:52:03.429 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to add to what i mentioned
earlier

02:52:03.429 --> 02:52:03.439 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:52:05.030 --> 02:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
my children
 
02:52:07.190 --> 02:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
during the height of the pandemic i
 
02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
brought them out to the supermarket
 
02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
because i wanted them to see the world
 
02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
and experience other people besides
 
02:52:14.230 --> 02:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
their mom and dad and brothers and
 
02:52:14.240 --> 02:52:16.070 align:start position:0%
their mom and dad and brothers and
sisters

02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
sisters
 
02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:16.950 align:start position:0%
sisters
um

02:52:16.950 --> 02:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:18.790 --> 02:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
you know it proved to be a teachable
 
02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
moment to be sure we had a gentleman
 
02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
probably in his 40s to 60s come up to us
 
02:52:28.070 --> 02:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
and start screaming at our faces and at
 
02:52:29.590 --> 02:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
my children
 
02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
um you know telling them that their
 
02:52:33.429 --> 02:52:33.439 align:start position:0%
father was setting a bad example for
 
02:52:36.710 --> 02:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
them um you know and uh
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
and then he looked to me and said
 
02:52:40.469 --> 02:52:40.479 align:start position:0%
is this what you want to teach your
 
02:52:42.230 --> 02:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
children and and i looked at them and i
 
02:52:44.309 --> 02:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
i said very calmly sir
 
02:52:46.070 --> 02:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
yes it is what i want to teach them i
 
02:52:47.590 --> 02:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
want to teach them to stand up to
 
02:52:50.309 --> 02:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
bullies i want to stand i want to teach
 
02:52:52.070 --> 02:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
them to do the right thing no matter
 
02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
what pressure is coming up against them
 
02:52:57.190 --> 02:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
to do the wrong thing and i think that
 
02:52:59.030 --> 02:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
this is probably one of the best lessons
 
02:53:01.110 --> 02:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
they've had all year
 
02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
and i said i'm gonna i'm gonna turn and
 
02:53:07.269 --> 02:53:07.279 align:start position:0%
get to my grocery shopping now
 
02:53:09.429 --> 02:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
this is my cell phone number if you'd
 
02:53:11.990 --> 02:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
like to sit down and have a coffee with
 
02:53:14.469 --> 02:53:14.479 align:start position:0%
me we could talk about this some more
 
02:53:16.950 --> 02:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
um i never heard from the guy
 
02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:17.990 align:start position:0%
um i never heard from the guy
but

02:53:17.990 --> 02:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:53:20.309 --> 02:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
the point of the matter is that
 
02:53:22.230 --> 02:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
that was one of many
 
02:53:24.230 --> 02:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances that one involving my
 
02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
children and it was a wonderful lesson
 
02:53:29.349 --> 02:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
that they learned i want other children
 
02:53:31.590 --> 02:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
to have that same ability i think this
 
02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
is a great bill
 
02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
nobody should be told that they're going
 
02:53:36.950 --> 02:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
to kill other people because they're not
 
02:53:38.550 --> 02:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask that's and and
 
02:53:41.110 --> 02:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that is not only
 
02:53:42.790 --> 02:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
what our government was saying and you
 
02:53:42.800 --> 02:53:44.070 align:start position:0%
what our government was saying and you
know

02:53:44.070 --> 02:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:53:46.630 --> 02:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
fauci being the chief among them saying
 
02:53:48.630 --> 02:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
lies like that
 
02:53:51.269 --> 02:53:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh but um you know our teachers were
 
02:53:53.269 --> 02:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
telling that to to public school
 
02:53:55.590 --> 02:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
children in the school room and
 
02:53:57.190 --> 02:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's just unconscionable i don't know
 
02:53:58.710 --> 02:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
how you can go and look at yourself in
 
02:53:59.750 --> 02:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
the mirror
 
02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh at the end of the day and feel okay
 
02:54:03.510 --> 02:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
with yourself after saying something
 
02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
like that a lie like that to a child
 
02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
um and and so to that point i began
 
02:54:11.510 --> 02:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
bringing a mirror around with me and
 
02:54:13.030 --> 02:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
putting it in my pocket when i went to
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
the grocery store i did not have the
 
02:54:18.070 --> 02:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use it but my intent was
 
02:54:21.510 --> 02:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
if anyone started screaming at me again
 
02:54:23.590 --> 02:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
i was just going to hold up the mirror
 
02:54:25.190 --> 02:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
and let them know that what they were
 
02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:26.150 align:start position:0%
and let them know that what they were
doing

02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:54:27.990 --> 02:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
is not what they should be doing look at
 
02:54:29.830 --> 02:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
yourself look at what you're doing to
 
02:54:31.590 --> 02:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
other people do you want that on your
 
02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:33.269 align:start position:0%
other people do you want that on your
conscience

02:54:33.269 --> 02:54:33.279 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
02:54:35.110 --> 02:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
sad that we have to have a bill to ask
 
02:54:37.030 --> 02:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
that question but
 
02:54:39.349 --> 02:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
i think we do thank you very much thank
 
02:54:40.950 --> 02:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any questions
 
02:54:42.550 --> 02:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:54:49.030 --> 02:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:51.030 --> 02:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
okay the next individual is
 
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:06.550 --> 02:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to actually continue on
 
02:55:11.590 --> 02:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:13.830 --> 02:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
so this is what i sent the
 
02:55:15.590 --> 02:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
this is what i had sent the
 
02:55:20.550 --> 02:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:24.550 --> 02:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
mrs so-and-so spent spending 18 minutes
 
02:55:26.309 --> 02:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
with carmela then coming to the
 
02:55:28.230 --> 02:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
conclusion that she can wear a mask
 
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
quote unquote no problem is
 
02:55:32.070 --> 02:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
irresponsible and disturbing
 
02:55:34.389 --> 02:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
what kind of mental health center
 
02:55:35.510 --> 02:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
are you
 
02:55:37.510 --> 02:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
are you all that spending 18 minutes
 
02:55:39.190 --> 02:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
after not seeing her for six months
 
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
because they shut it down
 
02:55:43.830 --> 02:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
is enough to make that determination
 
02:55:45.670 --> 02:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
after all of the information i have
 
02:55:48.150 --> 02:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
provided to you it is most definitely it
 
02:55:49.990 --> 02:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
most definitely feels
 
02:55:52.389 --> 02:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
like a place where providers are not
 
02:55:54.469 --> 02:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
putting the interests of their patients
 
02:55:54.479 --> 02:55:55.429 align:start position:0%
putting the interests of their patients
first

02:55:55.429 --> 02:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:55:56.870 --> 02:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
that is for sure
 
02:55:58.870 --> 02:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
you can guarantee
 
02:56:00.309 --> 02:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
that the counseling center of new
 
02:56:02.469 --> 02:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
england will be held fully responsible
 
02:56:05.190 --> 02:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
and liable if my daughter has a panic
 
02:56:07.510 --> 02:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
attack anxiety attack or any other
 
02:56:09.750 --> 02:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
mental health breakdown at school or
 
02:56:11.670 --> 02:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere else because she is required to
 
02:56:13.750 --> 02:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
wear a mask for an extended period of
 
02:56:15.830 --> 02:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
time when she has long standing
 
02:56:18.389 --> 02:56:18.399 align:start position:0%
diagnosed disabilities these kinds of
 
02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
occurrences can cause significant and
 
02:56:24.630 --> 02:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:26.469 --> 02:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
i would like to tell you uh two
 
02:56:28.630 --> 02:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
scenarios that happened at the school
 
02:56:31.190 --> 02:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
which caused me to pull my kids out
 
02:56:35.110 --> 02:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:37.349 --> 02:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
the the thing that was most debilitating
 
02:56:38.790 --> 02:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
for my daughter was because it was
 
02:56:41.429 --> 02:56:41.439 align:start position:0%
covering her entire face she felt like
 
02:56:43.190 --> 02:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
she couldn't breathe
 
02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
so she always would if it was just
 
02:56:46.630 --> 02:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
underneath her nose you know she was
 
02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:48.150 align:start position:0%
underneath her nose you know she was
okay

02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:56:51.269 --> 02:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
so there was a science teacher
 
02:56:53.990 --> 02:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
that used to this is the speaks into
 
02:56:56.230 --> 02:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
this bill about the bullying and the
 
02:57:00.230 --> 02:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
sensor shaming and said you know keep my
 
02:57:02.710 --> 02:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
mother alive she used to say that to the
 
02:57:05.269 --> 02:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
kids all the time
 
02:57:07.269 --> 02:57:07.279 align:start position:0%
another teacher
 
02:57:07.279 --> 02:57:08.389 align:start position:0%
another teacher
um

02:57:08.389 --> 02:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:10.389 --> 02:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
after the third time this happened i
 
02:57:12.550 --> 02:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
basically said that i would sue the
 
02:57:14.710 --> 02:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
school so they were kind of like
 
02:57:17.590 --> 02:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
politely asked to leave but in any case
 
02:57:19.190 --> 02:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
would go over and
 
02:57:22.309 --> 02:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
physically touch my kid's face and pull
 
02:57:24.790 --> 02:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
the mask over her nose because she's not
 
02:57:26.630 --> 02:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
wearing it correctly
 
02:57:28.630 --> 02:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of stuff that has taken
 
02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:29.510 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of stuff that has taken
place

02:57:29.510 --> 02:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:57:31.830 --> 02:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
rampantly throughout the state
 
02:57:33.750 --> 02:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
and i would like to of course i've
 
02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
signed that petition
 
02:57:37.830 --> 02:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
with rebuild reopen new hampshire as
 
02:57:39.510 --> 02:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
well i want to make sure that that
 
02:57:42.870 --> 02:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
petition not only is on record i want it
 
02:57:45.510 --> 02:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
on the calendar i want that to be
 
02:57:47.990 --> 02:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
infused in this house
 
02:57:49.349 --> 02:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:57:51.510 --> 02:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
there are redress of grievances there
 
02:57:53.590 --> 02:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
are um rules that should be followed
 
02:57:55.910 --> 02:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
with that i want that petition to be
 
02:57:58.150 --> 02:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
known not just in this committee i want
 
02:58:00.070 --> 02:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
that to be fully through the house and i
 
02:58:02.150 --> 02:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
know that how that works and petitions
 
02:58:04.389 --> 02:58:04.399 align:start position:0%
need to be heard thoroughly
 
02:58:06.389 --> 02:58:06.399 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to just
 
02:58:09.190 --> 02:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
say the same thing about new hampshire
 
02:58:10.870 --> 02:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire is not a home
 
02:58:13.030 --> 02:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
rule state the constitution delegates
 
02:58:15.349 --> 02:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
that only the general court may suspend
 
02:58:16.870 --> 02:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
laws of the state
 
02:58:20.230 --> 02:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
part 1 article 29 i know my time is up
 
02:58:21.670 --> 02:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
and the power to make laws that
 
02:58:24.230 --> 02:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
authority only lies
 
02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:25.030 align:start position:0%
authority only lies
with

02:58:25.030 --> 02:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:58:27.670 --> 02:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
of course the legislature the school
 
02:58:31.750 --> 02:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
boards never had any authority at all
 
02:58:34.230 --> 02:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
and we've been literally hijacked and
 
02:58:35.750 --> 02:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
held hostage
 
02:58:37.990 --> 02:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
because what it takes is lawyers that
 
02:58:40.870 --> 02:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
are not stepping up in this state and
 
02:58:42.630 --> 02:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
public officials that are not doing
 
02:58:44.950 --> 02:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
anything either to include
 
02:58:47.429 --> 02:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
our head of state
 
02:58:47.439 --> 02:58:48.389 align:start position:0%
our head of state
so

02:58:48.389 --> 02:58:48.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:58:49.990 --> 02:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
we can never let this happen again i
 
02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:55.590 --> 02:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
to be pushed through quickly i mean i
 
02:58:57.510 --> 02:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
know how it normally works
 
02:58:59.750 --> 02:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
if this is i want this expedited we
 
02:59:01.910 --> 02:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
should be talking to the governor we
 
02:59:04.150 --> 02:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
should you know he came out on wednesday
 
02:59:06.630 --> 02:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
if this is what they really want the doe
 
02:59:08.790 --> 02:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
you get the governor behind it we need
 
02:59:12.710 --> 02:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
full force here we can't wait until june
 
02:59:14.550 --> 02:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
and i just want to make that clear if
 
02:59:16.870 --> 02:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
this passes through it should be parent
 
02:59:19.269 --> 02:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
choice that's pretty much it it really
 
02:59:21.349 --> 02:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
needs to this has got to get done
 
02:59:21.359 --> 02:59:22.230 align:start position:0%
needs to this has got to get done
because

02:59:22.230 --> 02:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:59:25.910 --> 02:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
words don't speak anymore anymore so
 
02:59:32.230 --> 02:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:37.349 --> 02:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:52.150 --> 02:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:53.429 --> 02:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
hello again
 
02:59:55.830 --> 02:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'm maureen hardy from londonderry
 
02:59:57.750 --> 02:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
i would like my testimony from the
 
03:00:00.950 --> 03:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
previous bill to also apply to this bill
 
03:00:02.150 --> 03:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
and i will be providing that
 
03:00:03.990 --> 03:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
electronically so that you can click on
 
03:00:06.150 --> 03:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
the links
 
03:00:08.790 --> 03:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
the previous bill was hb1131 and this
 
03:00:10.269 --> 03:00:10.279 align:start position:0%
one is
 
03:00:10.279 --> 03:00:12.070 align:start position:0%
one is
hb1371

03:00:12.070 --> 03:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
hb1371
 
03:00:15.830 --> 03:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
i wanted to touch briefly on
 
03:00:18.150 --> 03:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
the bangladesh study
 
03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned previously that is
 
03:00:22.710 --> 03:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
supposedly a study in favor of masking
 
03:00:24.389 --> 03:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to point out
 
03:00:26.790 --> 03:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
that even if that was a legitimate study
 
03:00:28.150 --> 03:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
it found no
 
03:00:31.269 --> 03:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
benefit from wearing cloth masks at all
 
03:00:34.469 --> 03:00:34.479 align:start position:0%
and it only found an 11 benefit from
 
03:00:36.870 --> 03:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
wearing a surgical mask and that was
 
03:00:39.830 --> 03:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
only in the age 50 plus
 
03:00:43.030 --> 03:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
cohort so it has absolutely no relevance
 
03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
to school children
 
03:00:47.590 --> 03:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
i also want to read
 
03:00:50.630 --> 03:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
something very quickly this is from
 
03:00:52.630 --> 03:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
new england journal of medicine from
 
03:00:54.790 --> 03:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
early in the pandemic and it's from five
 
03:00:57.429 --> 03:00:57.439 align:start position:0%
positions writing to the journal
 
03:00:59.670 --> 03:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
and this is from the article
 
03:01:01.510 --> 03:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
it is also clear that masks serve
 
03:01:03.190 --> 03:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
symbolic roles
 
03:01:05.670 --> 03:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
masks are not only tools they are also
 
03:01:07.349 --> 03:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
talismans that may help increase
 
03:01:09.269 --> 03:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers perceived sense of
 
03:01:11.590 --> 03:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
safety well-being and trust in their
 
03:01:13.990 --> 03:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals although such reactions may
 
03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
not be strictly logical we are all
 
03:01:18.230 --> 03:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
subject to fear and anxiety especially
 
03:01:21.030 --> 03:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
during time of crisis one might argue
 
03:01:22.550 --> 03:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
that fear and anxiety are better
 
03:01:24.870 --> 03:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
countered with data and education than
 
03:01:27.190 --> 03:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
with a marginally beneficial mask
 
03:01:29.030 --> 03:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
particularly in light of the worldwide
 
03:01:31.349 --> 03:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
mass shortage but is it difficult to get
 
03:01:33.349 --> 03:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
clinicians to hear this message in the
 
03:01:35.590 --> 03:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
heat of the current crisis
 
03:01:37.670 --> 03:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
expanding masking protocol's greatest
 
03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:38.950 align:start position:0%
expanding masking protocol's greatest
contribution

03:01:38.950 --> 03:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
may be to reduce the transmission of
 
03:01:41.120 --> 03:01:42.550 align:start position:0%
may be to reduce the transmission of
anxiety

03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
anxiety
 
03:01:44.469 --> 03:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
over and above
 
03:01:46.309 --> 03:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
whatever role they may play in reducing
 
03:01:48.870 --> 03:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
transmission of coven 19. so i just want
 
03:01:50.389 --> 03:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
to point out that this is why it should
 
03:01:51.990 --> 03:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
be parents choice
 
03:01:53.750 --> 03:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
people who do not have this anxiety
 
03:01:54.710 --> 03:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
should not
 
03:01:56.550 --> 03:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
have to make their children wear masks
 
03:01:58.469 --> 03:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
and if people do have the anxiety they
 
03:02:02.150 --> 03:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
should be totally free to wear masks um
 
03:02:04.150 --> 03:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
finally i just want to
 
03:02:05.910 --> 03:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
share a small story of what i've
 
03:02:05.920 --> 03:02:07.429 align:start position:0%
share a small story of what i've
observed

03:02:07.429 --> 03:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
observed
 
03:02:10.070 --> 03:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
i i started attending school
 
03:02:11.830 --> 03:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
board meetings in the fall because of my
 
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
concern for the children
 
03:02:16.870 --> 03:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
and i observed a parent uh speaking to
 
03:02:19.190 --> 03:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
the school board about the bullying that
 
03:02:21.510 --> 03:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
her child was receiving because she
 
03:02:23.269 --> 03:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
chose not to wear a mask but the time
 
03:02:25.910 --> 03:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
masks were optional in londonderry
 
03:02:28.389 --> 03:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
and she had screenshots of the horrible
 
03:02:30.790 --> 03:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
comments that were sent to her child
 
03:02:32.950 --> 03:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
and she had all this evidence and she
 
03:02:35.190 --> 03:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
was showing it to the school board
 
03:02:38.070 --> 03:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
and she was told to just stop flat at
 
03:02:39.510 --> 03:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
three minutes she wasn't allowed to
 
03:02:41.750 --> 03:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
finish her testimony
 
03:02:43.670 --> 03:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
and she said i just want to ask one
 
03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:45.349 align:start position:0%
and she said i just want to ask one
question

03:02:45.349 --> 03:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:02:47.349 --> 03:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
and the school board chairman told her
 
03:02:49.349 --> 03:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
we don't answer questions
 
03:02:49.359 --> 03:02:50.070 align:start position:0%
we don't answer questions
so

03:02:50.070 --> 03:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:02:51.830 --> 03:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
i really think a bill like this is
 
03:02:54.550 --> 03:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
important so that the school boards
 
03:02:56.469 --> 03:02:56.479 align:start position:0%
listen to parents if their child is
 
03:02:58.550 --> 03:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
being bullied and also to make it clear
 
03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
that being bullied for not wearing a
 
03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:01.190 align:start position:0%
that being bullied for not wearing a
mask

03:03:01.190 --> 03:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
mask
 
03:03:03.030 --> 03:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
is just as bad as any other kind of
 
03:03:06.710 --> 03:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
bullying and that's all i have to say
 
03:03:08.389 --> 03:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:17.510 --> 03:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:19.110 --> 03:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:03:21.190 --> 03:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question did you say earlier
 
03:03:23.269 --> 03:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
that you were a nurse
 
03:03:29.910 --> 03:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:31.510 --> 03:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
would it be okay if i were to follow up
 
03:03:33.990 --> 03:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
with you sure
 
03:03:35.830 --> 03:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
if you have a question yeah thank you
 
03:03:35.840 --> 03:03:36.630 align:start position:0%
if you have a question yeah thank you
okay

03:03:36.630 --> 03:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:03:36.640 --> 03:03:37.590 align:start position:0%
okay
um

03:03:37.590 --> 03:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:39.910 --> 03:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna preface this with a would you
 
03:03:39.920 --> 03:03:41.510 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna preface this with a would you
believe

03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
believe
 
03:03:44.309 --> 03:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
that i have an 11 year old and at open
 
03:03:44.319 --> 03:03:45.510 align:start position:0%
that i have an 11 year old and at open
circle

03:03:45.510 --> 03:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
circle
 
03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:46.710 align:start position:0%
circle
recently

03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
recently
 
03:03:49.110 --> 03:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
they went around the room with a what
 
03:03:50.630 --> 03:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
annoys you
 
03:03:52.710 --> 03:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
and one child spoke up and they said it
 
03:03:55.269 --> 03:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
annoys them when not everybody gets the
 
03:03:55.279 --> 03:03:56.710 align:start position:0%
annoys them when not everybody gets the
vaccine

03:03:56.710 --> 03:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:03:58.309 --> 03:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
and when they got to the teacher the
 
03:03:59.910 --> 03:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
teacher spoke up
 
03:04:02.230 --> 03:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
and said that they are annoyed when not
 
03:04:04.630 --> 03:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
everyone wears their mask properly
 
03:04:05.830 --> 03:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
i want you to understand that my
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
children have been through a lot even
 
03:04:08.950 --> 03:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
though i did get the shot and i did
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
still get covered but they assumed
 
03:04:13.269 --> 03:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
because i sit here without a mask or
 
03:04:15.670 --> 03:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
you know whatever i'm republican i
 
03:04:18.070 --> 03:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
didn't get vaccinated um
 
03:04:21.269 --> 03:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
that being said i have questions for you
 
03:04:24.309 --> 03:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
about this bill and i want to ask any
 
03:04:26.309 --> 03:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
experts out there because i worry about
 
03:04:29.510 --> 03:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences okay so my
 
03:04:30.870 --> 03:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
questions are
 
03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
number one
 
03:04:35.510 --> 03:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
number one i fear that we've broken the
 
03:04:37.670 --> 03:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
ice out there with a mass okay so i'm
 
03:04:39.190 --> 03:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
afraid it could become a crutch i've
 
03:04:41.190 --> 03:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
heard superintendents actually say maybe
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
we can eradicate cold and flu season
 
03:04:45.429 --> 03:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
right by in the schools by having mass
 
03:04:48.469 --> 03:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
all the time but my question is
 
03:04:50.950 --> 03:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm not a scientist okay my
 
03:04:53.510 --> 03:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
degree is in accounting um i'm assuming
 
03:04:55.190 --> 03:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
we have a pandemic once every hundred
 
03:04:57.269 --> 03:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
years but
 
03:04:59.190 --> 03:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
but what happens if if we pass a bill
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
like this and at some point we really do
 
03:05:02.950 --> 03:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
need them so
 
03:05:05.830 --> 03:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's part a of my question
 
03:05:08.469 --> 03:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to give you a part b
 
03:05:11.030 --> 03:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
if that's okay secondly
 
03:05:13.750 --> 03:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
my fear also is when it comes to these
 
03:05:15.750 --> 03:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
particular bills
 
03:05:17.349 --> 03:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
you know i know we're arguing that these
 
03:05:19.590 --> 03:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
masks are ineffective
 
03:05:21.510 --> 03:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
i don't necessarily disagree i just
 
03:05:23.510 --> 03:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
worry that if we push too hard on it is
 
03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
it suddenly going to become that our
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
children have to wear three-ply masks
 
03:05:29.590 --> 03:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
with filters or suddenly the n95 is okay
 
03:05:30.950 --> 03:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
for the child
 
03:05:33.030 --> 03:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
so i was just curious in your expert
 
03:05:34.790 --> 03:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
opinion if you had comments on either of
 
03:05:36.150 --> 03:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
those two points
 
03:05:36.160 --> 03:05:37.030 align:start position:0%
those two points
um

03:05:37.030 --> 03:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:39.990 --> 03:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
my comment on a is you're worried if a
 
03:05:42.469 --> 03:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
more dangerous virus comes around i'm
 
03:05:45.030 --> 03:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
assuming a respiratory virus
 
03:05:47.910 --> 03:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
um the masks will still be
 
03:05:50.150 --> 03:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
useless against that virus and if
 
03:05:51.590 --> 03:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
anything would give a false sense of
 
03:05:51.600 --> 03:05:53.110 align:start position:0%
anything would give a false sense of
security

03:05:53.110 --> 03:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
security
 
03:05:53.120 --> 03:05:54.389 align:start position:0%
security
um

03:05:54.389 --> 03:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:54.399 --> 03:05:56.070 align:start position:0%
um
to

03:05:56.070 --> 03:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:05:57.830 --> 03:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
the public that they are protecting
 
03:05:59.830 --> 03:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
themselves by wearing masks out in
 
03:06:01.910 --> 03:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
public and they should probably take
 
03:06:05.429 --> 03:06:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:12.389 --> 03:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
there could be a disease that goes
 
03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
around that may need
 
03:06:18.630 --> 03:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
a respirator that would need to be fit
 
03:06:18.640 --> 03:06:20.150 align:start position:0%
a respirator that would need to be fit
tested

03:06:20.150 --> 03:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
tested
 
03:06:20.160 --> 03:06:21.190 align:start position:0%
tested
but

03:06:21.190 --> 03:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:06:23.349 --> 03:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
these respirators are not approved for
 
03:06:24.469 --> 03:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
they're not approved for children
 
03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
they're not for children to wear they're
 
03:06:27.750 --> 03:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
not sized for children they're
 
03:06:29.830 --> 03:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable to wear i know when i wore
 
03:06:32.309 --> 03:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
one i could only wear it for maybe 45
 
03:06:35.190 --> 03:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
minutes or an hour and i had to stop
 
03:06:38.070 --> 03:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
leave the hood leave the room and and
 
03:06:39.590 --> 03:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
catch some breath before i can go back
 
03:06:42.070 --> 03:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
to work so i don't really think it's
 
03:06:42.080 --> 03:06:43.830 align:start position:0%
to work so i don't really think it's
plausible

03:06:43.830 --> 03:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
plausible
 
03:06:46.790 --> 03:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
for some kind of a

03:06:59.269 --> 03:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
03:07:00.630 --> 03:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
03:07:08.710 --> 03:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:25.429 --> 03:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:29.429 --> 03:07:29.439 align:start position:0%
excuse my uh state of undress
 
03:07:31.750 --> 03:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
um my name is rachel goldsmith i'm a
 
03:07:35.910 --> 03:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
manchester resident of seven years
 
03:07:37.750 --> 03:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
and chair of moms for liberty
 
03:07:40.550 --> 03:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county
 
03:07:42.630 --> 03:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
we heard earlier that
 
03:07:44.790 --> 03:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
there has been no randomized controlled
 
03:07:44.800 --> 03:07:46.630 align:start position:0%
there has been no randomized controlled
study

03:07:46.630 --> 03:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
study
 
03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
done on children for
 
03:07:48.800 --> 03:07:49.990 align:start position:0%
done on children for
masking

03:07:49.990 --> 03:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
masking
 
03:07:52.950 --> 03:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
and i looked into why that is uh it's
 
03:07:55.590 --> 03:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
considered unethical by scientists to
 
03:07:57.830 --> 03:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
perform a study
 
03:08:00.630 --> 03:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
um with controls and variables on
 
03:08:02.309 --> 03:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
experimental devices in a potentially
 
03:08:04.790 --> 03:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
life-threatening situation so
 
03:08:08.150 --> 03:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
the reason that we've never done a study
 
03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
on children or even on adults is because
 
03:08:13.750 --> 03:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's literally unethical by scientists
 
03:08:15.670 --> 03:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
and doctors and yet representatives of
 
03:08:17.269 --> 03:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
our government
 
03:08:20.230 --> 03:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
believe that they are confident enough
 
03:08:22.150 --> 03:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
to make medical decisions for granite
 
03:08:25.190 --> 03:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
state families and individuals
 
03:08:27.510 --> 03:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
if masks worked we'd see significant
 
03:08:30.309 --> 03:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
differences in ifrs between 23 months
 
03:08:32.309 --> 03:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
old and 24 months old
 
03:08:33.670 --> 03:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
03:08:36.309 --> 03:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
we'd see mass deaths in states without
 
03:08:39.190 --> 03:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
masks compared to states with mandates
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
public health officials have called
 
03:08:46.389 --> 03:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
cloth masks no more than facial
 
03:08:46.399 --> 03:08:47.990 align:start position:0%
cloth masks no more than facial
decorations

03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
decorations
 
03:08:50.150 --> 03:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
i find those words extremely offensive
 
03:08:52.550 --> 03:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
they are not facial decorations they are
 
03:08:54.870 --> 03:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
impediments to socialization
 
03:08:57.830 --> 03:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
verbal and non-verbal communication and
 
03:08:59.910 --> 03:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
emotional development
 
03:09:03.269 --> 03:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
they are the direct cause of 150
 
03:09:05.990 --> 03:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
increase in suicide and teen girls
 
03:09:09.510 --> 03:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh doubling uh
 
03:09:12.469 --> 03:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
doubled numbers of toddlers with speech
 
03:09:14.160 --> 03:09:15.110 align:start position:0%
doubled numbers of toddlers with speech
delays

03:09:15.110 --> 03:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
delays
 
03:09:16.389 --> 03:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
speech delays
 
03:09:18.550 --> 03:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
in fact the cdc just released an update
 
03:09:21.190 --> 03:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
to toddler milestones for the first time
 
03:09:23.670 --> 03:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
in 20 years decreasing the number of
 
03:09:27.269 --> 03:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
words considered normal at 2 from 200
 
03:09:27.279 --> 03:09:28.150 align:start position:0%
words considered normal at 2 from 200
words

03:09:28.150 --> 03:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
words
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
to 100.
 
03:09:34.229 --> 03:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
this is not because children are somehow
 
03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
less capable of speaking
 
03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
for a reason other than
 
03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:40.710 align:start position:0%
for a reason other than
the

03:09:40.710 --> 03:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:09:42.630 --> 03:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
language development challenges
 
03:09:44.550 --> 03:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
associated with not being able to see
 
03:09:48.389 --> 03:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
the faces of their parents of their
 
03:09:54.389 --> 03:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:56.469 --> 03:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
i know that it's hard to change your
 
03:09:58.389 --> 03:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
mind when you've been convinced of
 
03:09:58.399 --> 03:09:59.429 align:start position:0%
mind when you've been convinced of
something

03:09:59.429 --> 03:09:59.439 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:10:02.150 --> 03:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
for a long time
 
03:10:04.950 --> 03:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
but the science has changed
 
03:10:07.269 --> 03:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
we hear that from everyone
 
03:10:08.710 --> 03:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
if that's true
 
03:10:10.630 --> 03:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
then why are public schools using
 
03:10:12.389 --> 03:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
metrics to determine mitigation
 
03:10:12.399 --> 03:10:13.830 align:start position:0%
metrics to determine mitigation
strategies

03:10:13.830 --> 03:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
strategies
 
03:10:16.150 --> 03:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
that were determined two years ago
 
03:10:19.830 --> 03:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
schools are losing students at
 
03:10:23.429 --> 03:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
unprecedented rates
 
03:10:25.349 --> 03:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
they need to change something or they're
 
03:10:26.870 --> 03:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
going to have to make alterations to
 
03:10:28.790 --> 03:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
their budgets
 
03:10:30.469 --> 03:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
look around today
 
03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:32.640 align:start position:0%

03:10:35.349 --> 03:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
where are the people that you claim to
 
03:10:35.359 --> 03:10:36.630 align:start position:0%
where are the people that you claim to
represent

03:10:36.630 --> 03:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:10:39.190 --> 03:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
this is not for you
 
03:10:41.429 --> 03:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
who are forcing children to cover their

an opportunity here

school boards are taking their lead from

you and from

state officials
 
03:10:58.710 --> 03:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
please support this bill and set the

tone of science and rationality thank

03:11:26.710 --> 03:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
okay i just wanted to say that i have
 
03:11:29.269 --> 03:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
definitely seen kids being bullied um
 
03:11:31.030 --> 03:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
for not wearing a mask the kids even go
 
03:11:32.550 --> 03:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
after adults if they see them without
 
03:11:34.389 --> 03:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
wearing masks um it's what they've been
 
03:11:36.870 --> 03:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
told for years so this is definitely as
 
03:11:39.429 --> 03:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
crazy as the town it's very important to
 
03:11:39.439 --> 03:11:41.190 align:start position:0%
crazy as the town it's very important to
implement

03:11:41.190 --> 03:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
implement
 
03:11:43.349 --> 03:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to just say
 
03:11:45.830 --> 03:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
if you think of the masked timeline if
 
03:11:47.990 --> 03:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
parents are choosing to send their kids
 
03:11:50.389 --> 03:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
to school with a mask um
 
03:11:51.750 --> 03:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
they get out of their car and they're
 
03:11:54.550 --> 03:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
using an old mask a dirty mask the bus
 
03:11:57.190 --> 03:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
drivers we try our best people we can't
 
03:11:58.469 --> 03:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
wash our hands before we hand out the
 
03:12:00.229 --> 03:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
masks we've been driving all day we've
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
been doing many things i mean i keep
 
03:12:04.389 --> 03:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
mine in a plastic ziploc but i've seen
 
03:12:06.630 --> 03:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
them in glove compartment boxes i've
 
03:12:08.710 --> 03:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
seen them like in a pile on the
 
03:12:11.030 --> 03:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
dashboard these aren't clean medical
 
03:12:12.630 --> 03:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
instruments the way that people are
 
03:12:14.630 --> 03:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
imagining that they're helping um the
 
03:12:16.630 --> 03:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
kids wear the masks for all day long i
 
03:12:17.910 --> 03:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
think they maybe change them out at
 
03:12:20.469 --> 03:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
lunchtime but they come to me with food
 
03:12:23.349 --> 03:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
with bodily fluids um the coffins knees
 
03:12:24.550 --> 03:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
they don't understand that they're
 
03:12:26.229 --> 03:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to change them in between that
 
03:12:28.309 --> 03:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
like fellow drivers also do the same
 
03:12:29.990 --> 03:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
thing so it's not just the kids it's
 
03:12:31.349 --> 03:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
adults um
 
03:12:33.670 --> 03:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
they're just it's germ factories it's
 
03:12:35.670 --> 03:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
disgusting and we're not teaching these
 
03:12:37.670 --> 03:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
kids proper hygiene they just have to
 
03:12:39.429 --> 03:12:39.439 align:start position:0%
wear a mask that's the only rule so they
 
03:12:41.670 --> 03:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
can come with ripped masks dirty masks
 
03:12:42.870 --> 03:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter as long as they have
 
03:12:44.389 --> 03:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
something covering their face and this
 
03:12:46.550 --> 03:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
is this is what the schools are pushing
 
03:12:48.150 --> 03:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
so um i just wanted to point that out
 
03:12:50.229 --> 03:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
that if you're gonna send your kid there
 
03:12:52.469 --> 03:12:52.479 align:start position:0%
has to be a whole system implemented in
 
03:12:53.670 --> 03:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
this um
 
03:12:55.429 --> 03:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's not just one mask for a day
 
03:12:56.790 --> 03:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
these kids are wearing the same mask
 
03:12:59.510 --> 03:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
every day it's if if they did a spot
 
03:13:01.110 --> 03:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
test and just checked
 
03:13:02.469 --> 03:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
everybody should take your mask off
 
03:13:04.229 --> 03:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
let's see what's going on on the mask it
 
03:13:05.750 --> 03:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
would be quite eye opening and i think
 
03:13:07.429 --> 03:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
that this would stop instantly if we
 
03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
actually knew what we were breathing in
 
03:13:10.790 --> 03:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
03:13:14.150 --> 03:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:13:22.790 --> 03:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:24.950 --> 03:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
hello again alex manila where i just
 
03:13:27.030 --> 03:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
want to go on record in support
 
03:13:30.389 --> 03:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
of hb 1371 couple of comments on this
 
03:13:30.399 --> 03:13:31.910 align:start position:0%
of hb 1371 couple of comments on this
one

03:13:31.910 --> 03:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:13:33.429 --> 03:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
again i just want to
 
03:13:35.830 --> 03:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
make it clear right there's no solution
 
03:13:37.670 --> 03:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
to this with two sides opposing each
 
03:13:39.910 --> 03:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
other right and we can cite studies all
 
03:13:41.510 --> 03:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
over the place you're not going to
 
03:13:42.870 --> 03:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
convince the other side you have to do
 
03:13:43.990 --> 03:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
what's best
 
03:13:45.990 --> 03:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
for yourself here so the only solution
 
03:13:46.950 --> 03:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
is to
 
03:13:48.630 --> 03:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
realize that the power belongs to the
 
03:13:51.349 --> 03:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
people and for individuals to make
 
03:13:52.630 --> 03:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
health decisions that are best for
 
03:13:54.389 --> 03:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
themselves and their families that's the
 
03:13:55.510 --> 03:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
only solution otherwise we're gonna have
 
03:13:57.910 --> 03:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
to keep coming here in snowstorms and
 
03:13:59.750 --> 03:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know calling out of work to come
 
03:14:01.030 --> 03:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
like we're not gonna stop fighting you
 
03:14:02.469 --> 03:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
guys on this so
 
03:14:04.550 --> 03:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
pass the bill i i highly recommend that
 
03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:05.429 align:start position:0%
pass the bill i i highly recommend that
um

03:14:05.429 --> 03:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:06.950 --> 03:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing i heard a question from
 
03:14:09.110 --> 03:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative glitchfield about like
 
03:14:10.790 --> 03:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
what if we really do need the mask like
 
03:14:12.469 --> 03:14:12.479 align:start position:0%
what if there's a really bad pandemic we
 
03:14:14.150 --> 03:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
actually need these things you wouldn't
 
03:14:15.990 --> 03:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
need legislation at that point right
 
03:14:18.309 --> 03:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
like if somebody sprayed anthrax all
 
03:14:20.469 --> 03:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
over the place i i know like all right
 
03:14:22.070 --> 03:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
i'm in trouble here i need a mask you
 
03:14:24.550 --> 03:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
know or some a respirator
 
03:14:26.150 --> 03:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
so you wouldn't really need legislation
 
03:14:29.269 --> 03:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
people would do it automatically um
 
03:14:31.429 --> 03:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
and then just one other comment on that
 
03:14:33.349 --> 03:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
personally i'd rather have a pandemic
 
03:14:35.670 --> 03:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
rip through society than have tyrants
 
03:14:37.670 --> 03:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
running around rounding people up for
 
03:14:39.429 --> 03:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
not wearing masks and not injecting
 
03:14:41.190 --> 03:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals into their bodies that's
 
03:14:43.750 --> 03:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
insanity that doesn't better society
 
03:14:45.429 --> 03:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
society works when people have
 
03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
individual choice it's the only way the
 
03:14:49.510 --> 03:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
only way this is going to work so i hope
 
03:14:49.520 --> 03:14:50.389 align:start position:0%
only way this is going to work so i hope
you

03:14:50.389 --> 03:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:14:52.630 --> 03:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
consider that and pass this bill thank
 
03:14:54.550 --> 03:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much
 
03:14:56.630 --> 03:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
03:14:59.030 --> 03:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you
 
03:15:14.550 --> 03:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:16.389 --> 03:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
thank you to everyone again there were
 
03:15:18.309 --> 03:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
two topics i wanted to touch on based on
 
03:15:20.870 --> 03:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised
 
03:15:20.880 --> 03:15:22.469 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised
one

03:15:22.469 --> 03:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:15:24.070 --> 03:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
as far as my background goes i'm a
 
03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
certified industrial hygienist certified
 
03:15:27.030 --> 03:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
safety professional professional
 
03:15:28.550 --> 03:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
engineer there's only 200 of us in the
 
03:15:30.150 --> 03:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
united states
 
03:15:31.590 --> 03:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
on top of that i was trained in
 
03:15:33.190 --> 03:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
behavioral psychology i finished first
 
03:15:35.510 --> 03:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
of my class in behavioral marketing one
 
03:15:36.710 --> 03:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
of the issues that comes up over and
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
over again and we need courage from our
 
03:15:38.399 --> 03:15:39.830 align:start position:0%
over again and we need courage from our
legislatures

03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislatures
 
03:15:39.840 --> 03:15:40.630 align:start position:0%
legislatures
is

03:15:40.630 --> 03:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:15:42.150 --> 03:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
this whole issue of everybody's been
 
03:15:44.229 --> 03:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
made afraid in the art of persuasion
 
03:15:45.830 --> 03:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's four ways in order of
 
03:15:48.150 --> 03:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
effectiveness people are persuaded fear
 
03:15:49.349 --> 03:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
number one
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
people coiling a ball if they're afraid
 
03:15:52.790 --> 03:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
and do what they're told
 
03:15:54.389 --> 03:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
emotional appeal
 
03:15:56.870 --> 03:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
wear mask to save your fellow citizen
 
03:15:58.229 --> 03:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
pretty effective
 
03:16:00.550 --> 03:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
propaganda which means repeated message
 
03:16:02.710 --> 03:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
ask mass mask
 
03:16:05.590 --> 03:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
logic least effective mass don't work
 
03:16:08.229 --> 03:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate that in context of what's
 
03:16:10.309 --> 03:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
going on there have been tens of
 
03:16:11.910 --> 03:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars
 
03:16:14.309 --> 03:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
to sell a certain message
 
03:16:17.349 --> 03:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
so we do need some courage the second
 
03:16:18.950 --> 03:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
point i want to make is in the field of
 
03:16:20.710 --> 03:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
industrial hygiene
 
03:16:21.990 --> 03:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
we have what we call hierarchy of
 
03:16:23.590 --> 03:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
controls i mentioned it briefly but it's
 
03:16:25.510 --> 03:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
important representative in the corner
 
03:16:27.110 --> 03:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
said what if we have a student that has
 
03:16:29.269 --> 03:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
this condition we want to protect them
 
03:16:31.269 --> 03:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
as opposed to somebody else they need a
 
03:16:31.279 --> 03:16:32.790 align:start position:0%
as opposed to somebody else they need a
mask

03:16:32.790 --> 03:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
mask
 
03:16:34.710 --> 03:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
that is not the answer under the
 
03:16:36.469 --> 03:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
hierarchy of controls
 
03:16:38.469 --> 03:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
masks don't even fit respirators are the
 
03:16:40.389 --> 03:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
least desirable because our people don't
 
03:16:42.630 --> 03:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
wear them long term for hours
 
03:16:44.150 --> 03:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
the most effective control is
 
03:16:46.229 --> 03:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
engineering controls you have a lot of
 
03:16:47.910 --> 03:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
state money available
 
03:16:51.590 --> 03:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's not being used to improve the hvac
 
03:16:51.600 --> 03:16:52.630 align:start position:0%
it's not being used to improve the hvac
systems

03:16:52.630 --> 03:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
systems
 
03:16:54.950 --> 03:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
through improved ventilation fresh air
 
03:16:58.229 --> 03:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
or better filtration merv 17 or better
 
03:17:00.150 --> 03:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
or the technologies that actually
 
03:17:02.389 --> 03:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
destroy the virus those solutions
 
03:17:04.070 --> 03:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
protect everyone
 
03:17:05.590 --> 03:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have to have this mass
 
03:17:07.830 --> 03:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
respirator argument this is basic
 
03:17:09.429 --> 03:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
industrial hygiene that goes back to
 
03:17:11.510 --> 03:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
1950. thank you
 
03:17:13.190 --> 03:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions from
 
03:17:15.510 --> 03:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:17:17.590 --> 03:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:19.349 --> 03:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
over there right there is what
 
03:17:19.359 --> 03:17:21.750 align:start position:0%
over there right there is what
represents

03:17:21.750 --> 03:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
represents
 
03:17:23.910 --> 03:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:17:26.469 --> 03:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
the ones that kill everything
 
03:17:28.710 --> 03:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
are those difficult and expensive to
 
03:17:31.110 --> 03:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
install in a school
 
03:17:31.120 --> 03:17:32.309 align:start position:0%
install in a school
um

03:17:32.309 --> 03:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:35.269 --> 03:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
the answer is no in fact
 
03:17:38.710 --> 03:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
in august of 2020 i was approached by a
 
03:17:40.389 --> 03:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
school district with a high school of
 
03:17:42.389 --> 03:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
700 autistic children
 
03:17:44.229 --> 03:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
they could not wear masks
 
03:17:46.150 --> 03:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
we put in the new calgon eye wave
 
03:17:48.150 --> 03:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
improved ventilation
 
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
i think they had two cases i think were
 
03:17:51.269 --> 03:17:51.279 align:start position:0%
both brought in that year because the
 
03:17:52.630 --> 03:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
students wouldn't and couldn't wear
 
03:17:52.640 --> 03:17:55.670 align:start position:0%
students wouldn't and couldn't wear
masks

03:17:55.670 --> 03:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:55.680 --> 03:17:56.469 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:17:56.469 --> 03:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:57.990 --> 03:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of this presentation which
 
03:17:59.510 --> 03:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
will be made available to everybody i
 
03:18:01.750 --> 03:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
put in the technologies that and what
 
03:18:03.349 --> 03:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
their costs are
 
03:18:06.150 --> 03:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
how how effective they are
 
03:18:07.990 --> 03:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
for schools you'll need one of two types
 
03:18:09.510 --> 03:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
of technology one you can put on the
 
03:18:11.510 --> 03:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
central system if you have
 
03:18:14.070 --> 03:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
air conditioning that that has duct work
 
03:18:15.590 --> 03:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
there are some older schools and some
 
03:18:17.190 --> 03:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
areas where
 
03:18:18.950 --> 03:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
you don't have doctor work you just have
 
03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
baseboard or whatever
 
03:18:22.229 --> 03:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
and there are standalone systems that
 
03:18:23.750 --> 03:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
i've listed as well and what their costs
 
03:18:25.190 --> 03:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
are and districts are putting these in
 
03:18:27.510 --> 03:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
i've consulted for free
 
03:18:29.990 --> 03:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
with way over a dozen districts if they
 
03:18:31.590 --> 03:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
if they want to play ball i will talk to
 
03:18:34.710 --> 03:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
their hvac systems their board whoever
 
03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
if they give me three minutes i say
 
03:18:37.510 --> 03:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
don't waste my time if they'll give me
 
03:18:39.830 --> 03:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
30 minutes i'll donate my time
 
03:18:42.070 --> 03:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
and and that's happening very frequently
 
03:18:44.229 --> 03:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
so the solutions are here the costs are
 
03:18:46.229 --> 03:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
here the effectivenesses are here
 
03:18:46.239 --> 03:18:47.110 align:start position:0%
here the effectivenesses are here
um

03:18:47.110 --> 03:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:49.110 --> 03:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
and i would just say don't get trapped
 
03:18:51.110 --> 03:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
in this argument about masks for this
 
03:18:53.190 --> 03:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
group and not this group or respirators
 
03:18:55.190 --> 03:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
for this group or that group that is the
 
03:18:57.110 --> 03:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
bottom of the barrel solution and there
 
03:18:58.710 --> 03:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
are much better solutions they've been
 
03:19:00.950 --> 03:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
known for 80 years
 
03:19:02.469 --> 03:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
and just don't get trapped in that
 
03:19:02.479 --> 03:19:03.990 align:start position:0%
and just don't get trapped in that
argument

03:19:03.990 --> 03:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
argument
 
03:19:08.710 --> 03:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:08.720 --> 03:19:19.670 align:start position:0%
 
rusan

03:19:19.670 --> 03:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:21.030 --> 03:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
03:19:23.830 --> 03:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
committee members um i actually am
 
03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
really excited that i was able to go
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
right after um the last speaker because
 
03:19:32.469 --> 03:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to bring it up that maybe
 
03:19:34.630 --> 03:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's time to start asking why
 
03:19:36.870 --> 03:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
why is the school boards doubling down
 
03:19:39.750 --> 03:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
and and and being bring more and more
 
03:19:42.309 --> 03:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
school boards are being brought to court
 
03:19:44.150 --> 03:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
over some of these mandates and some of
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
the ways they're doing the things
 
03:19:47.269 --> 03:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
why are why now in my school district
 
03:19:54.229 --> 03:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
is the school board meetings no longer
 
03:19:55.750 --> 03:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
open to the public
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
and they're not having them they cancel
 
03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
them and then they meet and vote behind
 
03:20:01.200 --> 03:20:02.309 align:start position:0%
them and then they meet and vote behind
because

03:20:02.309 --> 03:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:20:04.550 --> 03:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
there's a crisis
 
03:20:06.710 --> 03:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
so that's a big thing is why are we
 
03:20:09.910 --> 03:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
still why is this happening
 
03:20:09.920 --> 03:20:11.030 align:start position:0%
still why is this happening
um

03:20:11.030 --> 03:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:13.590 --> 03:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense in a lot of ways
 
03:20:17.030 --> 03:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
kovid is on the wane
 
03:20:20.630 --> 03:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
so why are school boards still insisting
 
03:20:22.790 --> 03:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
why are our school boards and our school
 
03:20:25.030 --> 03:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
board members and our principals and our
 
03:20:28.710 --> 03:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
superintendents still saying we can't
 
03:20:30.950 --> 03:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
trust the parents
 
03:20:33.590 --> 03:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
we don't want the parents input
 
03:20:35.349 --> 03:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of testimony in this
 
03:20:37.670 --> 03:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
committee i know that you guys have
 
03:20:39.510 --> 03:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of testimony in this
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
committee about how
 
03:20:45.030 --> 03:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
really kind of ridiculous the school
 
03:20:47.990 --> 03:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
board seems to be treating parents
 
03:20:50.309 --> 03:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
maybe it's time to start asking why i
 
03:20:52.550 --> 03:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
know in my school districts for instance
 
03:20:55.190 --> 03:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
they would rather put a new they would
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
rather put
 
03:20:56.399 --> 03:20:57.190 align:start position:0%
rather put
in

03:20:57.190 --> 03:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:20:57.200 --> 03:20:59.990 align:start position:0%
in
um

03:20:59.990 --> 03:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
books that are going to cost all kinds
 
03:21:03.429 --> 03:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
of litigation
 
03:21:06.309 --> 03:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
than a system like this person it was
 
03:21:09.510 --> 03:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
presented that system was presented
 
03:21:11.830 --> 03:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
they would rather spend the money on
 
03:21:14.469 --> 03:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
litigating against parents instead of
 
03:21:17.190 --> 03:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
trying to help our students
 
03:21:20.469 --> 03:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
develop normal appropriate relationships
 
03:21:22.070 --> 03:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
i've talked a lot in this committee
 
03:21:24.469 --> 03:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
about reactive attachment disorder
 
03:21:26.469 --> 03:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:21:28.309 --> 03:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
i encourage you folks to read the
 
03:21:29.590 --> 03:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
definition i'm not going to read the
 
03:21:30.950 --> 03:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
definition because i only have three
 
03:21:33.429 --> 03:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
minutes but the bottom line is is if you
 
03:21:36.309 --> 03:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
read the definition of retec reactive
 
03:21:39.429 --> 03:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
attachment disorder and what causes it
 
03:21:40.790 --> 03:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's what we've been doing for our
 
03:21:44.630 --> 03:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:44.640 --> 03:21:45.670 align:start position:0%
 
why

03:21:45.670 --> 03:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:21:47.590 --> 03:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
why are we doing this to our children
 
03:21:50.550 --> 03:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
why the powers that be said maybe they
 
03:21:53.030 --> 03:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
were afraid maybe they really thought
 
03:21:55.110 --> 03:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
that this was the next
 
03:21:56.229 --> 03:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
the next
 
03:21:56.239 --> 03:21:57.349 align:start position:0%
the next
polio

03:21:57.349 --> 03:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
polio
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
maybe they thought it was the next
 
03:22:01.590 --> 03:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
whatever but why are they still doing it
 
03:22:01.600 --> 03:22:03.030 align:start position:0%
whatever but why are they still doing it
then

03:22:03.030 --> 03:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:22:05.830 --> 03:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
don't you have to say why at some point
 
03:22:07.269 --> 03:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
when do we say
 
03:22:09.429 --> 03:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
this doesn't make sense anymore i've
 
03:22:11.750 --> 03:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of shaming and i've seen a
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
lot of bullying and i'll tell you part
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
of my problem is it's much easier to
 
03:22:19.030 --> 03:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
bully someone
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
when you don't feel like they're human
 
03:22:20.880 --> 03:22:22.150 align:start position:0%
when you don't feel like they're human
anymore

03:22:22.150 --> 03:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
03:22:24.950 --> 03:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
you do this to someone and they're not
 
03:22:27.590 --> 03:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
human anymore it's easier to bully
 
03:22:31.269 --> 03:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
someone like this than it is like this
 
03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
think about that
 
03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
the other thing is the school boards are
 
03:22:37.110 --> 03:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
getting a lot i have a school board
 
03:22:38.630 --> 03:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
candidate right now
 
03:22:41.030 --> 03:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
that said the reason why he supported
 
03:22:43.190 --> 03:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
the mass mandate in our school was
 
03:22:45.429 --> 03:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
because he got more covered money for
 
03:22:45.439 --> 03:22:46.710 align:start position:0%
because he got more covered money for
supporting

03:22:46.710 --> 03:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
03:22:48.630 --> 03:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
the masks
 
03:22:48.640 --> 03:22:50.389 align:start position:0%
the masks
boom

03:22:50.389 --> 03:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
boom
 
03:22:52.790 --> 03:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
we're done
 
03:22:54.790 --> 03:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you do are there any
 
03:22:57.349 --> 03:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members
 
03:23:00.070 --> 03:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you
 
03:23:05.670 --> 03:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:05.680 --> 03:23:26.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:23:26.389 --> 03:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:28.550 --> 03:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
yeah or you can just leave them in there
 
03:23:31.750 --> 03:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
on the desk and there uh so that you
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
know anything that was handed out we can
 
03:23:35.910 --> 03:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
hand out to people when the other
 
03:23:37.830 --> 03:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
members arrive
 
03:23:39.750 --> 03:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what we oftentimes do is
 
03:23:41.910 --> 03:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
just there's a number of things in there
 
03:23:48.630 --> 03:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
okay so we let's go ahead and get this
 
03:23:53.830 --> 03:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
other one introduced and done
 
03:23:54.950 --> 03:23:54.960 align:start position:0%

03:24:06.550 --> 03:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:28.870 --> 03:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:45.750 --> 03:24:45.760 align:start position:0%

03:25:21.520 --> 03:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:25:31.860 --> 03:25:31.870 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:31.870 --> 03:25:36.469 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:25:36.469 --> 03:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:00.630 --> 03:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:00.640 --> 03:26:06.309 align:start position:0%

well i'll tell you you know at first i
 
03:26:38.550 --> 03:26:38.560 align:start position:0%

here and then i said oh yeah they're
 
03:26:41.670 --> 03:26:41.680 align:start position:0%

said jeepers are those jets going over
top

03:26:44.309 --> 03:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
top
 
03:26:45.830 --> 03:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know what's on my mind right now
 
03:26:47.030 --> 03:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
03:26:47.040 --> 03:26:48.790 align:start position:0%
it's just
yeah

03:26:48.790 --> 03:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:26:51.349 --> 03:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it sounds like something yes
 
03:26:54.630 --> 03:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:57.110 --> 03:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's the blade the blade is on the floor
 
03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:15.760 --> 03:27:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:27:33.750 --> 03:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna go ahead and start here
 
03:27:51.349 --> 03:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
folks uh
 
03:27:55.510 --> 03:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
we have hb 1141 uh on the docket right
 
03:27:58.070 --> 03:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
now we've heard this once before and we
 
03:27:59.670 --> 03:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
have an amendment coming back to us
 
03:28:00.790 --> 03:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:28:02.790 --> 03:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
really we needed the second hearing

it can be expensive
 
03:29:59.990 --> 03:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
i i've
 
03:30:02.870 --> 03:30:02.880 align:start position:0%

in a uh
 
03:30:45.349 --> 03:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
special uh excuse me in an iep meeting
 
03:30:46.469 --> 03:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
and i have
 
03:30:49.190 --> 03:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know packets for anyone who cares of
 
03:30:50.469 --> 03:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
all the
 
03:30:53.110 --> 03:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
federal law involved in this
 
03:30:54.790 --> 03:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:30:56.550 --> 03:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
there is
 
03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
federal law related to who
 
03:31:02.790 --> 03:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
is involved in an iep meeting
 
03:31:02.800 --> 03:31:03.750 align:start position:0%
is involved in an iep meeting
and

03:31:03.750 --> 03:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:03.760 --> 03:31:04.790 align:start position:0%
and
in

03:31:04.790 --> 03:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:31:07.110 --> 03:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
no way
 
03:31:07.120 --> 03:31:07.990 align:start position:0%
no way
would

03:31:07.990 --> 03:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:31:10.870 --> 03:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
a school district lawyer
 
03:31:14.469 --> 03:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
be an eligible participant in an iep
 
03:31:14.479 --> 03:31:15.429 align:start position:0%
be an eligible participant in an iep
meeting

03:31:15.429 --> 03:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
03:31:18.389 --> 03:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
so i want to get that into statute
 
03:31:21.190 --> 03:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
so that parents
 
03:31:21.200 --> 03:31:22.950 align:start position:0%
so that parents
have

03:31:22.950 --> 03:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:31:26.070 --> 03:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully along the way the knowledge
 
03:31:26.080 --> 03:31:28.070 align:start position:0%
hopefully along the way the knowledge
that

03:31:28.070 --> 03:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:31:29.670 --> 03:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
that is not
 
03:31:32.790 --> 03:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
proper and they can object to that
 
03:31:36.469 --> 03:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
participant being in the meeting
 
03:31:40.950 --> 03:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
second coming down on page two section 4
 
03:31:43.990 --> 03:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:47.830 --> 03:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
we had testimony about
 
03:31:50.469 --> 03:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
how wonderful it is that
 
03:31:52.830 --> 03:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire goes
 
03:31:55.670 --> 03:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
beyond state law
 
03:31:57.349 --> 03:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
and federal law
 
03:32:02.309 --> 03:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:04.309 --> 03:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
i have a problem
 
03:32:05.590 --> 03:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:32:08.469 --> 03:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with any
 
03:32:08.479 --> 03:32:09.670 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with any
executive

03:32:09.670 --> 03:32:09.680 align:start position:0%

03:32:09.680 --> 03:32:10.710 align:start position:0%
executive
branch

03:32:10.710 --> 03:32:10.720 align:start position:0%

agency

03:32:13.510 --> 03:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:15.670 --> 03:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
going beyond what is in state law or
 
03:32:17.670 --> 03:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
03:32:20.950 --> 03:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
rules should be based on
 
03:32:20.960 --> 03:32:24.309 align:start position:0%
rules should be based on
law

03:32:24.309 --> 03:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:28.080 --> 03:32:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:32:30.710 --> 03:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
i can give you that was handed out at
 
03:32:33.910 --> 03:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
the 581 subcommittee a chart that shows
 
03:32:33.920 --> 03:32:34.950 align:start position:0%
the 581 subcommittee a chart that shows
where

03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:32:37.510 --> 03:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire rules go beyond
 
03:32:39.750 --> 03:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
state law or federal law
 
03:32:39.760 --> 03:32:41.990 align:start position:0%
state law or federal law
so

03:32:41.990 --> 03:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:44.309 --> 03:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
i'm putting in here that
 
03:32:46.950 --> 03:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
it has to be consistent with law any
 
03:32:49.190 --> 03:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
rule making
 
03:32:49.200 --> 03:32:50.550 align:start position:0%
rule making
thirdly

03:32:50.550 --> 03:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
thirdly
 
03:32:50.560 --> 03:32:51.670 align:start position:0%
thirdly
um

03:32:51.670 --> 03:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:54.070 --> 03:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
mediation starts right below that in
 
03:32:56.150 --> 03:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
section five
 
03:32:56.160 --> 03:32:57.349 align:start position:0%
section five
um

03:32:57.349 --> 03:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:00.070 --> 03:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
and we heard from many parents
 
03:33:00.080 --> 03:33:01.510 align:start position:0%
and we heard from many parents
about

03:33:01.510 --> 03:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:33:04.150 --> 03:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
being forced to find
 
03:33:05.550 --> 03:33:05.560 align:start position:0%
forced to sign
 
03:33:10.710 --> 03:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:10.720 --> 03:33:11.670 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:33:11.670 --> 03:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:33:15.190 --> 03:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
and that is what you see following there
 
03:33:15.200 --> 03:33:17.590 align:start position:0%
and that is what you see following there
but

03:33:17.590 --> 03:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:17.600 --> 03:33:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
mediation

03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
mediation
 
03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be a confidential process
 
03:33:26.070 --> 03:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
and that that's in federal law and
 
03:33:27.750 --> 03:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
i recognize that
 
03:33:29.910 --> 03:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
but also in federal law
 
03:33:33.349 --> 03:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
is the fact that it is illegal
 
03:33:33.359 --> 03:33:34.550 align:start position:0%
is the fact that it is illegal
to

03:33:34.550 --> 03:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:33:37.510 --> 03:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
force a parent going into mediation
 
03:33:39.469 --> 03:33:39.479 align:start position:0%
to sign a non-disclosure or a
 
03:33:41.830 --> 03:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
confidentiality agreement
 
03:33:43.750 --> 03:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
so i want to get that
 
03:33:48.229 --> 03:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
um on the record in law as well
 
03:33:49.590 --> 03:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
and fourth
 
03:33:52.790 --> 03:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
um is covered over on starting on page
 
03:33:52.800 --> 03:33:54.150 align:start position:0%
um is covered over on starting on page
three

03:33:54.150 --> 03:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:33:55.750 --> 03:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
in section six
 
03:33:57.750 --> 03:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
and that is access to student
 
03:33:57.760 --> 03:33:59.269 align:start position:0%
and that is access to student
information

03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
um we've heard from multiple parents
 
03:34:02.160 --> 03:34:03.590 align:start position:0%
um we've heard from multiple parents
about

03:34:03.590 --> 03:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:34:06.790 --> 03:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
not being able to get
 
03:34:06.800 --> 03:34:09.190 align:start position:0%
not being able to get
records

03:34:09.190 --> 03:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
records
 
03:34:09.200 --> 03:34:12.389 align:start position:0%
records
not

03:34:12.389 --> 03:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:16.710 --> 03:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
finding all the proper documentation in
 
03:34:16.720 --> 03:34:18.710 align:start position:0%
finding all the proper documentation in
those

03:34:18.710 --> 03:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
records from the
 
03:34:26.070 --> 03:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
school board and the school district
 
03:34:26.080 --> 03:34:27.190 align:start position:0%
school board and the school district
and

03:34:27.190 --> 03:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:34:29.910 --> 03:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
federal law also provides if they see
 
03:34:31.429 --> 03:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
something that has been put into the
 
03:34:34.389 --> 03:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
record they have the abi the right to
 
03:34:37.190 --> 03:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
object and um
 
03:34:40.309 --> 03:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
object to that and uh uh go through a
 
03:34:42.710 --> 03:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
process to
 
03:34:45.349 --> 03:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
possibly have any misinformation as they
 
03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
see it corrected so i wanted to get
 
03:34:54.070 --> 03:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:56.550 --> 03:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
so i think that all of this is um
 
03:34:59.750 --> 03:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
consistent with federal law and refers
 
03:35:03.349 --> 03:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
in in most cases to the chapter um in
 
03:35:06.070 --> 03:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
ida that applies
 
03:35:08.870 --> 03:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
um and so that is the um
 
03:35:11.590 --> 03:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
intent of this
 
03:35:13.590 --> 03:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
amending language
 
03:35:16.550 --> 03:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
to address those four areas that we
 
03:35:16.560 --> 03:35:17.670 align:start position:0%
to address those four areas that we
heard

03:35:17.670 --> 03:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
heard
 
03:35:20.150 --> 03:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
often from parents
 
03:35:21.590 --> 03:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:35:23.429 --> 03:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative hobson and then
 
03:35:27.670 --> 03:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative moffat
 
03:35:29.830 --> 03:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you for your
 
03:35:32.630 --> 03:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
testimony today representative cordelli
 
03:35:35.110 --> 03:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
um i i may have other questions i'm
 
03:35:37.190 --> 03:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
still processing but my first question
 
03:35:37.200 --> 03:35:39.990 align:start position:0%
still processing but my first question
is

03:35:39.990 --> 03:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
i guess this is page 3
 
03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
line 16 i think you said
 
03:35:44.880 --> 03:35:45.830 align:start position:0%
line 16 i think you said
that

03:35:45.830 --> 03:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:35:48.070 --> 03:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
information could be added to a
 
03:35:50.070 --> 03:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
student's folder that the parent might
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
not want
 
03:35:54.389 --> 03:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
in the folder and i'm just wondering
 
03:35:56.229 --> 03:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
what might be an example of that because
 
03:35:57.910 --> 03:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
i can't think of
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
something that fits like
 
03:36:00.239 --> 03:36:02.150 align:start position:0%
something that fits like
it

03:36:02.150 --> 03:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:36:05.269 --> 03:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
i cannot remember testimony specific to
 
03:36:07.110 --> 03:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
that from parents but there were
 
03:36:07.120 --> 03:36:08.150 align:start position:0%
that from parents but there were
certainly

03:36:08.150 --> 03:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
03:36:08.160 --> 03:36:09.670 align:start position:0%
certainly
complaints

03:36:09.670 --> 03:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
03:36:09.680 --> 03:36:12.710 align:start position:0%
complaints
about

03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:14.710 --> 03:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
things that they objected to
 
03:36:16.229 --> 03:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
being in there
 
03:36:17.750 --> 03:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
things that they
 
03:36:20.309 --> 03:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
felt were missing
 
03:36:22.389 --> 03:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
information that was brought
 
03:36:25.910 --> 03:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:29.510 --> 03:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:31.349 --> 03:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
inaccurate or
 
03:36:33.349 --> 03:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
not complete
 
03:36:35.670 --> 03:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
in more cases uh
 
03:36:37.830 --> 03:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
than not it was more on the uh
 
03:36:40.710 --> 03:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
incomplete information um they felt not
 
03:36:42.870 --> 03:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
being presented as part of the the
 
03:36:44.630 --> 03:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
record for their child
 
03:36:46.389 --> 03:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:36:48.389 --> 03:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
they should have the right to
 
03:36:50.469 --> 03:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
review all those records and make sure
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
that the record um is complete and
 
03:36:52.800 --> 03:36:56.630 align:start position:0%
that the record um is complete and
accurate

03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:58.389 --> 03:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:37:00.070 --> 03:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
my question so i'm just looking at this
 
03:37:01.990 --> 03:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
amendment for the first time and on it
 
03:37:04.630 --> 03:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
says page three at the top uh the new
 
03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
language on if you go down to sub
 
03:37:09.190 --> 03:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
paragraphs j and k
 
03:37:11.830 --> 03:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
juliet and kilo
 
03:37:14.389 --> 03:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
so lines 13 through
 
03:37:14.399 --> 03:37:15.510 align:start position:0%
so lines 13 through
18.

03:37:15.510 --> 03:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
18.
 
03:37:17.510 --> 03:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
so if you look at line 13 this is
 
03:37:19.269 --> 03:37:19.279 align:start position:0%
discussions that occur during the
 
03:37:22.389 --> 03:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
mediation process shall be confidential
 
03:37:24.229 --> 03:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
and then if you go to line 16 the next
 
03:37:24.239 --> 03:37:25.590 align:start position:0%
and then if you go to line 16 the next
subparagraph

03:37:25.590 --> 03:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
subparagraph
 
03:37:27.429 --> 03:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
parties to the mediation
 
03:37:29.910 --> 03:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
process shall not be required to sign a
 
03:37:32.229 --> 03:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
confidentiality pledge
 
03:37:32.239 --> 03:37:33.269 align:start position:0%
confidentiality pledge
so

03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:34.710 --> 03:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
help me out a little bit here
 
03:37:37.030 --> 03:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that those two
 
03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
statements are in opposition to each
 
03:37:43.030 --> 03:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
other or am i not i might just i
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
i understand your your question
 
03:37:47.510 --> 03:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:37:48.790 --> 03:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
per law
 
03:37:51.750 --> 03:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
the mediation process is confidential
 
03:37:53.910 --> 03:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
but at the same time going into
 
03:37:53.920 --> 03:37:55.349 align:start position:0%
but at the same time going into
mediation

03:37:55.349 --> 03:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
mediation
 
03:37:57.190 --> 03:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
you cannot be required to sign a
 
03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreement
 
03:38:02.950 --> 03:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
and that also is in federal law
 
03:38:05.750 --> 03:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
as and as it says there or as a
 
03:38:05.760 --> 03:38:07.110 align:start position:0%
as and as it says there or as a
precondition

03:38:07.110 --> 03:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
precondition
 
03:38:10.950 --> 03:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:10.960 --> 03:38:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:38:11.990 --> 03:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:38:13.349 --> 03:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:15.030 --> 03:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
03:38:17.349 --> 03:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um i've got
 
03:38:19.510 --> 03:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
a uh just a couple i think just a couple
 
03:38:21.910 --> 03:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
of questions um right now but i think i
 
03:38:23.510 --> 03:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
i know i'm gonna have more when we come
 
03:38:27.830 --> 03:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:30.070 --> 03:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
and i'd be glad to give you any of this
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
information from the idea well that
 
03:38:33.910 --> 03:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
would be really helpful thank you very
 
03:38:35.349 --> 03:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
much sure
 
03:38:38.469 --> 03:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
um so um so first question is um in
 
03:38:42.150 --> 03:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
section two of line i'm sorry page one
 
03:38:43.429 --> 03:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
line 18
 
03:38:45.990 --> 03:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
where you use the term full participants
 
03:38:47.429 --> 03:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering how that is
 
03:38:49.189 --> 03:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
different than than
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
sort of regular participants
 
03:38:54.150 --> 03:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
and if there and are our full
 
03:38:57.030 --> 03:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
participants somehow implying that
 
03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
other participants are either partial or
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
have less um
 
03:39:02.550 --> 03:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
it was
 
03:39:05.349 --> 03:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
not my intention um to indicate that
 
03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
they are any different than others
 
03:39:10.309 --> 03:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
participation uh participants i'm sorry
 
03:39:14.150 --> 03:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
um uh just that uh and again if we look
 
03:39:17.590 --> 03:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
at law there are requirements um
 
03:39:17.600 --> 03:39:18.550 align:start position:0%
at law there are requirements um
uh

03:39:18.550 --> 03:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:39:20.710 --> 03:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
that parents do not have to be involved
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
in an iep meeting but there is a process
 
03:39:25.110 --> 03:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
that has to be
 
03:39:27.349 --> 03:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
gone through to make sure that they have
 
03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
been given the opportunity and
 
03:39:31.670 --> 03:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
documented the opportunity
 
03:39:34.150 --> 03:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
to attend that meeting so i just wanted
 
03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:40.389 --> 03:39:40.399 align:start position:0%
parent participation and even the child
 
03:39:40.399 --> 03:39:41.189 align:start position:0%
parent participation and even the child
when

03:39:41.189 --> 03:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:39:44.710 --> 03:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
possible participation
 
03:39:47.349 --> 03:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
is provided for okay so it doesn't mean
 
03:39:51.110 --> 03:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
that an iep meeting cannot go forward if
 
03:39:53.189 --> 03:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
a parent has decided not to participate
 
03:39:55.349 --> 03:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
that is correct yes okay thank you for
 
03:39:57.670 --> 03:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
that and then um
 
03:39:59.590 --> 03:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
another question
 
03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
for this afternoon
 
03:40:03.830 --> 03:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
03:40:06.630 --> 03:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
what cost obligations does a residential
 
03:40:09.429 --> 03:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
or does the district of re
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
district of residence
 
03:40:14.469 --> 03:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
have for students with ieps
 
03:40:16.550 --> 03:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
who are attending schools outside the
 
03:40:16.560 --> 03:40:20.469 align:start position:0%
who are attending schools outside the
district

03:40:20.469 --> 03:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:20.479 --> 03:40:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:40:21.830 --> 03:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:24.710 --> 03:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
it depends on what kind of school
 
03:40:27.030 --> 03:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
if if they're attending a charter school
 
03:40:29.670 --> 03:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
within the district then it's
 
03:40:31.830 --> 03:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon the resident district to
 
03:40:34.630 --> 03:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
provide um for the services
 
03:40:37.830 --> 03:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
let me rephrase the question i i i um
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
what i meant is attending a school
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
that's not part of that school district
 
03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
may it may be within the district they
 
03:40:46.790 --> 03:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
live but um like a private school a
 
03:40:48.309 --> 03:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
private school or a charter school or
 
03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
03:40:51.990 --> 03:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
with a private school um if the parent
 
03:40:54.389 --> 03:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
places their child in a private school
 
03:40:58.389 --> 03:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
there's a whole process defined in id
 
03:41:01.750 --> 03:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
idea it's um called parental placement
 
03:41:03.990 --> 03:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
and there is a formula worked out from
 
03:41:06.630 --> 03:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
the title one for funds
 
03:41:08.710 --> 03:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
total number of kids in that district
 
03:41:11.830 --> 03:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
with ieps um the funds available from
 
03:41:13.990 --> 03:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
title one and then what percentage of
 
03:41:16.710 --> 03:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
those funds would follow that child
 
03:41:18.389 --> 03:41:18.399 align:start position:0%
to the private school
 
03:41:19.670 --> 03:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
03:41:22.389 --> 03:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
services provided under uh
 
03:41:25.750 --> 03:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
not an iep but an interval service plan
 
03:41:28.790 --> 03:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
that is provided at that school okay so
 
03:41:28.800 --> 03:41:29.750 align:start position:0%
that is provided at that school okay so
so

03:41:29.750 --> 03:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to get to the
 
03:41:35.349 --> 03:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
distinction between a fape and an iep
 
03:41:35.359 --> 03:41:36.309 align:start position:0%
distinction between a fape and an iep
and

03:41:36.309 --> 03:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:38.790 --> 03:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
special education services
 
03:41:42.150 --> 03:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
and um and in section seven page four
 
03:41:44.150 --> 03:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
line four you talk about the district of
 
03:41:47.189 --> 03:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
residence having to
 
03:41:47.199 --> 03:41:48.070 align:start position:0%
residence having to
district

03:41:48.070 --> 03:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:41:50.309 --> 03:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
residents shall fund
 
03:41:52.389 --> 03:41:52.399 align:start position:0%
a free and appropriate public education
 
03:41:54.710 --> 03:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
for children with disabilities
 
03:41:55.830 --> 03:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
um and it keeps going in the least
 
03:41:57.590 --> 03:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
restricted environment and finishing out
 
03:41:59.670 --> 03:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
the you know
 
03:42:01.910 --> 03:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
in which the students iep can be
 
03:42:04.790 --> 03:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
implemented but the the cost portion of
 
03:42:07.670 --> 03:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
that is lines four and five there is a
 
03:42:09.189 --> 03:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
shall fund a free and appropriate
 
03:42:12.389 --> 03:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
education for children with disabilities
 
03:42:12.399 --> 03:42:13.510 align:start position:0%
education for children with disabilities
um

03:42:13.510 --> 03:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:15.189 --> 03:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
and this is obviously pertaining to
 
03:42:16.790 --> 03:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
students who are attending
 
03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
a uh charter school
 
03:42:21.110 --> 03:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
right or their resident school district
 
03:42:22.870 --> 03:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
right yeah well well there's there's two
 
03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
different things here because
 
03:42:27.349 --> 03:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
um if you're if if you're a child with
 
03:42:29.670 --> 03:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
an iep and you're going you're attending
 
03:42:31.830 --> 03:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
your resident school district
 
03:42:34.309 --> 03:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
that school districts
 
03:42:35.910 --> 03:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
they're in charge of all the costs the
 
03:42:37.269 --> 03:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
same way they're in charge of all the
 
03:42:39.429 --> 03:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
costs for a student that doesn't have an
 
03:42:41.670 --> 03:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
iep right but for charter it's very
 
03:42:44.070 --> 03:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
different they're under current law i do
 
03:42:47.189 --> 03:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
not believe they have the full
 
03:42:49.830 --> 03:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
the obligation for the full cost of
 
03:42:49.840 --> 03:42:51.429 align:start position:0%
the obligation for the full cost of
educating

03:42:51.429 --> 03:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
educating
 
03:42:53.830 --> 03:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
a student with or without an iep but
 
03:42:55.429 --> 03:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
they do have an obligation for special
 
03:42:57.830 --> 03:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
education costs
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
and that's different than a faith isn't
 
03:43:01.110 --> 03:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
that right
 
03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
with the charter school
 
03:43:05.670 --> 03:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
the resident district
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
is still responsible for the services
 
03:43:09.910 --> 03:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
for that child there's an iep we had
 
03:43:12.630 --> 03:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
legislation this year about
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
communication between the charter school
 
03:43:15.830 --> 03:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the
 
03:43:17.510 --> 03:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
resident district about that and
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
notification of iep meetings etc but um
 
03:43:24.150 --> 03:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i believe that the resident
 
03:43:26.630 --> 03:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
district is still responsible for the
 
03:43:26.640 --> 03:43:27.429 align:start position:0%
district is still responsible for the
free

03:43:27.429 --> 03:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
free
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate education and then um just
 
03:43:32.830 --> 03:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
has to work out with the charter school
 
03:43:35.670 --> 03:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
um where those services are performed
 
03:43:37.670 --> 03:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
basically but is isn't a free and
 
03:43:39.590 --> 03:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate educate the balloon of a
 
03:43:42.309 --> 03:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
free and appropriate education larger
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
than the then what's inside of it that
 
03:43:46.790 --> 03:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
is specifically
 
03:43:50.229 --> 03:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
special education services
 
03:43:50.239 --> 03:43:51.110 align:start position:0%
special education services
um

03:43:51.110 --> 03:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:53.030 --> 03:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
in this case we're talking
 
03:43:54.870 --> 03:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about a
 
03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
special child with a disability is
 
03:43:58.790 --> 03:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
eligible for
 
03:44:01.910 --> 03:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
um free and appropriate education they
 
03:44:05.030 --> 03:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
they are under under idea eligible for
 
03:44:07.110 --> 03:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
free and appropriate education
 
03:44:07.120 --> 03:44:08.150 align:start position:0%
free and appropriate education
um

03:44:08.150 --> 03:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:11.349 --> 03:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
i believe the new hampshire law says the
 
03:44:13.030 --> 03:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
district of residence
 
03:44:15.590 --> 03:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
is not
 
03:44:19.030 --> 03:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
a childish for an iep student
 
03:44:20.630 --> 03:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
attending a charter school is
 
03:44:23.349 --> 03:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
responsible for special education costs
 
03:44:26.309 --> 03:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
not the full cost of a fake isn't that
 
03:44:28.469 --> 03:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
oh i i think i know what you what you
 
03:44:33.189 --> 03:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:35.110 --> 03:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
the resident district is responsible for
 
03:44:36.389 --> 03:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:44:38.309 --> 03:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
the services specialized services for
 
03:44:40.309 --> 03:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
that child right um the rest of the
 
03:44:42.830 --> 03:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
education um
 
03:44:45.990 --> 03:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
is on the charter right based on the
 
03:44:47.750 --> 03:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
tuition uh that they are getting from
 
03:44:49.349 --> 03:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
the state for that child right so is
 
03:44:51.189 --> 03:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
this changing that
 
03:44:53.510 --> 03:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not intended to could you
 
03:44:55.030 --> 03:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
repeat where where
 
03:45:09.030 --> 03:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:14.150 --> 03:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
um yeah that that was not intended to um
 
03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
change anything related to a charter
 
03:45:19.189 --> 03:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
school okay so that so so really that's
 
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
to the resident district shall fund the
 
03:45:25.189 --> 03:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:26.630 --> 03:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
for children with disabilities in at
 
03:45:28.469 --> 03:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
least in the least restrictive
 
03:45:28.479 --> 03:45:29.830 align:start position:0%
least in the least restrictive
environment

03:45:29.830 --> 03:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
environment
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
your emphasis there was really the least
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
respected environment right student
 
03:45:33.600 --> 03:45:34.469 align:start position:0%
respected environment right student
right

03:45:34.469 --> 03:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:45:37.670 --> 03:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay yes okay
 
03:45:39.269 --> 03:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
are there further questions you thank
 
03:45:42.870 --> 03:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:44.469 --> 03:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
03:45:46.630 --> 03:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
kerdelli thank you for explaining this
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
um an awful lot of what you have in here
 
03:45:51.590 --> 03:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
is repeating what's already in federal
 
03:45:53.750 --> 03:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
law and i'm trying to understand why
 
03:45:56.229 --> 03:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
you're doing that
 
03:45:56.239 --> 03:45:58.229 align:start position:0%
you're doing that
um

03:45:58.229 --> 03:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:59.910 --> 03:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i
 
03:45:59.920 --> 03:46:01.990 align:start position:0%
thank you i
um

03:46:01.990 --> 03:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:04.469 --> 03:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
if you look at ida it's um
 
03:46:07.030 --> 03:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
quite voluminous
 
03:46:10.710 --> 03:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
as well as all the parent handbooks and
 
03:46:13.990 --> 03:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
state law and rules and so forth
 
03:46:14.000 --> 03:46:15.830 align:start position:0%
state law and rules and so forth
um

03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:17.670 --> 03:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of this
 
03:46:20.630 --> 03:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
is coming from parents and it
 
03:46:24.309 --> 03:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
in many cases it's not happening
 
03:46:24.319 --> 03:46:25.429 align:start position:0%
in many cases it's not happening
in

03:46:25.429 --> 03:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:46:29.349 --> 03:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:32.150 --> 03:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
i felt it important to
 
03:46:34.150 --> 03:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
put this
 
03:46:38.790 --> 03:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
into state law just so that um
 
03:46:41.590 --> 03:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
it's there for anyone to refer to
 
03:46:41.600 --> 03:46:43.349 align:start position:0%
it's there for anyone to refer to
um

03:46:43.349 --> 03:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to
 
03:46:45.120 --> 03:46:48.870 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to
address

03:46:48.870 --> 03:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:50.469 --> 03:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
in multiple
 
03:46:50.479 --> 03:46:52.950 align:start position:0%
in multiple
ways

03:46:52.950 --> 03:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:55.429 --> 03:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
to allow parents to get the services
 
03:46:58.070 --> 03:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
that they're entitled to
 
03:47:00.309 --> 03:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
and i thought that by
 
03:47:02.950 --> 03:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
putting it into state law was necessary
 
03:47:05.510 --> 03:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
but also providing the reference to
 
03:47:08.229 --> 03:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
federal law if the parents so choose to
 
03:47:10.070 --> 03:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
to look at the federal law
 
03:47:10.080 --> 03:47:12.150 align:start position:0%
to look at the federal law
um

03:47:12.150 --> 03:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
i i felt it important to put it into rsa
 
03:47:18.870 --> 03:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
our rsas because a lot of this wasn't
 
03:47:25.590 --> 03:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:28.550 --> 03:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
so if you do not use the exact same
 
03:47:30.389 --> 03:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
language as a federal law
 
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
it would suggest to me that you may be
 
03:47:34.070 --> 03:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps creating a confusing situation
 
03:47:35.429 --> 03:47:35.439 align:start position:0%
for those parents
 
03:47:37.030 --> 03:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
because they're not lawyers they're not
 
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
going to know how to read it and they
 
03:47:40.150 --> 03:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
probably don't know the federal law
 
03:47:41.830 --> 03:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
trumps state law in every one of these
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
cases and i'm concerned that
 
03:47:46.710 --> 03:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
and i don't know without going back and
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
looking at federal law where you are
 
03:47:50.389 --> 03:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
using the exact same language as federal
 
03:47:51.990 --> 03:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
law and where you sort of tried to
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
rewrite it into
 
03:47:55.189 --> 03:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
what you think federal law is saying and
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you can help me
 
03:47:56.960 --> 03:47:58.469 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you can help me
understand

03:47:58.469 --> 03:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
understand
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
what's happening here like where are you
 
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
capping state law and where are you sort
 
03:48:04.389 --> 03:48:04.399 align:start position:0%
of rewriting i mean capping federal law
 
03:48:06.150 --> 03:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
where are you kind of rewriting i i i
 
03:48:07.590 --> 03:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i'm not
 
03:48:08.950 --> 03:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:48:08.960 --> 03:48:10.309 align:start position:0%
trying to
um

03:48:10.309 --> 03:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:11.990 --> 03:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
add anything
 
03:48:15.750 --> 03:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
um specifically um
 
03:48:15.760 --> 03:48:16.550 align:start position:0%
um specifically um
so

03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:19.510 --> 03:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
i think in most cases what you see in
 
03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
bold is coming
 
03:48:25.349 --> 03:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
pretty much directly from
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
the state law excuse me the federal law
 
03:48:32.070 --> 03:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
the id idea i'm not trying to um
 
03:48:33.910 --> 03:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
go beyond that
 
03:48:33.920 --> 03:48:36.150 align:start position:0%
go beyond that
um

03:48:36.150 --> 03:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
in some cases maybe um
 
03:48:42.550 --> 03:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
the language uh might um
 
03:48:44.790 --> 03:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
be a little more uh
 
03:48:44.800 --> 03:48:46.469 align:start position:0%
be a little more uh
non-legal

03:48:46.469 --> 03:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
non-legal
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
um there's in federal law but um you
 
03:48:51.030 --> 03:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
know i'll give you the the sections that
 
03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
i'm referring to and um
 
03:48:58.389 --> 03:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:00.710 --> 03:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
what's there creating anything new
 
03:49:00.720 --> 03:49:02.950 align:start position:0%
what's there creating anything new
specifically

03:49:02.950 --> 03:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:49:05.910 --> 03:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
but just putting into our law you know
 
03:49:07.990 --> 03:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
what the options are for parents in
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
regard to ieps
 
03:49:15.110 --> 03:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
mediation and access to information
 
03:49:15.120 --> 03:49:16.389 align:start position:0%
mediation and access to information
so

03:49:16.389 --> 03:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:16.399 --> 03:49:17.269 align:start position:0%
so
i

03:49:17.269 --> 03:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:49:19.030 --> 03:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
haven't been at one point the parent of
 
03:49:21.670 --> 03:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
a special ed child i know that you get
 
03:49:23.189 --> 03:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
the booklet that's got all that stuff in
 
03:49:24.870 --> 03:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
it based on federal law
 
03:49:26.229 --> 03:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:49:28.469 --> 03:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
is that already in the booklet
 
03:49:28.479 --> 03:49:32.309 align:start position:0%
is that already in the booklet
um

03:49:32.309 --> 03:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:32.319 --> 03:49:34.070 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:49:35.990 --> 03:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
there are several booklets
 
03:49:40.790 --> 03:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
um that run um you know between 60 and
 
03:49:42.870 --> 03:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
200 pages if you depending on which
 
03:49:45.429 --> 03:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
booklet you're looking at and my looking
 
03:49:47.910 --> 03:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
at some of the booklets um is very
 
03:49:49.990 --> 03:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
confusing to me and i think we've talked
 
03:49:53.030 --> 03:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
about um in the department has
 
03:49:55.110 --> 03:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
started to look at
 
03:49:57.510 --> 03:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
rewriting some of those because
 
03:50:00.389 --> 03:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
in some cases it seems to contradict one
 
03:50:03.910 --> 03:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
another between the booklets so i think
 
03:50:03.920 --> 03:50:04.830 align:start position:0%
another between the booklets so i think
that

03:50:04.830 --> 03:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
clarification by the department in these
 
03:50:09.910 --> 03:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
handbooks is also necessary and i think
 
03:50:13.189 --> 03:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
that they recognize that as well
 
03:50:13.199 --> 03:50:14.469 align:start position:0%
that they recognize that as well
so

03:50:14.469 --> 03:50:14.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:15.990 --> 03:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
so i have a question and this is not
 
03:50:17.670 --> 03:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
meant to be nest your condescending and
 
03:50:19.110 --> 03:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
i don't want it to come across that way
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
in any way so you talk about how big the
 
03:50:23.830 --> 03:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
federal law is we have a big book here
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
too yes we know parents are not
 
03:50:27.510 --> 03:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily looking at the underlying
 
03:50:28.870 --> 03:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
statutes they're looking at those
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
booklets so my honest question is what
 
03:50:33.269 --> 03:50:33.279 align:start position:0%
does putting it in
 
03:50:34.950 --> 03:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
adding it to that booklet why is it any
 
03:50:36.389 --> 03:50:36.399 align:start position:0%
different than what's sitting in the
 
03:50:37.830 --> 03:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
03:50:42.309 --> 03:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
i i think it's also um important not
 
03:50:44.150 --> 03:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
just for parents but for school
 
03:50:44.160 --> 03:50:45.990 align:start position:0%
just for parents but for school
districts

03:50:45.990 --> 03:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
districts
 
03:50:48.630 --> 03:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh to see that because um you know i i
 
03:50:50.790 --> 03:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if they're gonna go you know
 
03:50:54.229 --> 03:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
searching through all this either um but
 
03:50:58.229 --> 03:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:59.750 --> 03:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
are happening and they shouldn't be
 
03:50:59.760 --> 03:51:01.429 align:start position:0%
are happening and they shouldn't be
happening

03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
happening
 
03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important to get it
 
03:51:06.870 --> 03:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:09.189 --> 03:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
so that districts
 
03:51:12.790 --> 03:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
know what the parameters are as well
 
03:51:15.670 --> 03:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
but isn't the remedy not
 
03:51:18.309 --> 03:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
putting it more in statutes i mean like
 
03:51:20.070 --> 03:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
many people here we have way too i think
 
03:51:21.910 --> 03:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
we have way too much instead both the
 
03:51:23.510 --> 03:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
federal especially the federal level but
 
03:51:25.349 --> 03:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
the state level too we have way too much
 
03:51:27.110 --> 03:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
too many words is what i'm trying to say
 
03:51:28.950 --> 03:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish what we do
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
and and
 
03:51:31.510 --> 03:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:51:32.950 --> 03:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
i spent five years with the us
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
department of education office for civil
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
rights enforcing special ed laws among
 
03:51:37.750 --> 03:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
other things
 
03:51:37.760 --> 03:51:38.550 align:start position:0%
other things
and

03:51:38.550 --> 03:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
it what was in the books whether it was
 
03:51:42.710 --> 03:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
in the books or in the books once or
 
03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
twice it didn't matter what mattered was
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
whether a school dish chose to do it and
 
03:51:48.870 --> 03:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
the school districts were all aware of
 
03:51:50.950 --> 03:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
it they were making conscious decisions
 
03:51:52.630 --> 03:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
not to follow the law
 
03:51:54.790 --> 03:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm still
 
03:51:57.030 --> 03:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
at a loss and again just this is just me
 
03:51:59.429 --> 03:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
i'm still in a losses to understand why
 
03:52:02.229 --> 03:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
putting federal law in our state law is
 
03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
going to change anything when it's
 
03:52:05.830 --> 03:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
already the law in the books school
 
03:52:07.110 --> 03:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
districts are going to follow it or
 
03:52:09.349 --> 03:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
they're not going to follow it and and i
 
03:52:10.710 --> 03:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
don't understand what making the book
 
03:52:14.950 --> 03:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:18.229 --> 03:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:21.110 --> 03:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
it will maybe help in a small way so
 
03:52:24.830 --> 03:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
that some of these things that
 
03:52:27.910 --> 03:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
um are supposed to be followed according
 
03:52:32.790 --> 03:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:35.189 --> 03:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
i think there will be multiple attempts
 
03:52:35.199 --> 03:52:36.469 align:start position:0%
i think there will be multiple attempts
um

03:52:36.469 --> 03:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:39.349 --> 03:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
some in the senate i know
 
03:52:41.349 --> 03:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
is this
 
03:52:43.590 --> 03:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
there was other legislation we've passed
 
03:52:43.600 --> 03:52:44.389 align:start position:0%
there was other legislation we've passed
in

03:52:44.389 --> 03:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:52:46.950 --> 03:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
relation to special education
 
03:52:48.229 --> 03:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
03:52:49.830 --> 03:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
special education
 
03:52:49.840 --> 03:52:50.710 align:start position:0%
special education
and

03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:50.720 --> 03:52:51.830 align:start position:0%
and
services

03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:52:54.389 --> 03:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
to parents are an important topic and
 
03:52:56.309 --> 03:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed and this is just a
 
03:52:59.110 --> 03:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
another way i wanted to uh to address it
 
03:52:59.120 --> 03:53:00.070 align:start position:0%
another way i wanted to uh to address it
um

03:53:00.070 --> 03:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:01.990 --> 03:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know having you know parents come in
 
03:53:04.710 --> 03:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
here like we saw with the 581 commission
 
03:53:06.389 --> 03:53:06.399 align:start position:0%
you know crying
 
03:53:10.550 --> 03:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:12.950 --> 03:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
we need to do things to address special
 
03:53:12.960 --> 03:53:19.349 align:start position:0%
we need to do things to address special
education

03:53:19.349 --> 03:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
let me try this
 
03:53:22.229 --> 03:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
i would just suggest that maybe what we
 
03:53:23.910 --> 03:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
need to be looking at is our enforcement
 
03:53:25.349 --> 03:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
mechanism rather than just getting one
 
03:53:28.309 --> 03:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:30.950 --> 03:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
that is well i wouldn't disagree
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
on on the enforcement part
 
03:53:35.910 --> 03:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you representative
 
03:53:35.920 --> 03:53:36.950 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you representative
cordelli

03:53:36.950 --> 03:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
03:53:36.960 --> 03:53:37.990 align:start position:0%
cordelli
um

03:53:37.990 --> 03:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:39.910 --> 03:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to be picky but i've gone
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
to a situation that has been a difficult
 
03:53:43.199 --> 03:53:44.070 align:start position:0%
to a situation that has been a difficult
one

03:53:44.070 --> 03:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:53:47.189 --> 03:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
when i was sitting in iep meetings every
 
03:53:50.870 --> 03:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
week with parents
 
03:53:50.880 --> 03:53:51.990 align:start position:0%
week with parents
parents

03:53:51.990 --> 03:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
parents
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
verse parent
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
singular or plural
 
03:53:58.389 --> 03:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
is used at varying places within the
 
03:54:01.110 --> 03:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that you have here on line
 
03:54:04.309 --> 03:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
30 on page two it's parent with an
 
03:54:07.030 --> 03:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
apostrophe s so it's the parent that one
 
03:54:10.469 --> 03:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
parent is not a plural
 
03:54:12.550 --> 03:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
is in possession there of that right to
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
the hearing up top we're talking on
 
03:54:19.269 --> 03:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
lines 10 the parents of the child may
 
03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
object to participation i've been in
 
03:54:21.840 --> 03:54:23.429 align:start position:0%
object to participation i've been in
situations

03:54:23.429 --> 03:54:23.439 align:start position:0%
situations
 
03:54:25.830 --> 03:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
where there are two parents
 
03:54:28.150 --> 03:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
not living together
 
03:54:28.160 --> 03:54:29.830 align:start position:0%
not living together
and

03:54:29.830 --> 03:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:32.710 --> 03:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
fighting with each other and one wants
 
03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
and one doesn't want
 
03:54:36.150 --> 03:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:54:36.160 --> 03:54:37.269 align:start position:0%
and so
um

03:54:37.269 --> 03:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:39.590 --> 03:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
i the parents of the child may object to
 
03:54:41.269 --> 03:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
the participation of an individual in
 
03:54:43.429 --> 03:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
the iep team meeting
 
03:54:45.110 --> 03:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
well you know you may not have both
 
03:54:46.870 --> 03:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
parents one might be in afghanistan well
 
03:54:49.269 --> 03:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
no longer afghanistan but hopefully but
 
03:54:51.349 --> 03:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in the military and the
 
03:54:53.830 --> 03:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
one that's at home
 
03:54:55.590 --> 03:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
is going to be making that decision or
 
03:54:57.990 --> 03:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
the one that's now living down in texas
 
03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
may not like this going on my child's
 
03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
not special service doesn't need that
 
03:55:05.670 --> 03:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
and so how do we account for in the and
 
03:55:08.389 --> 03:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
i know in in federal law when i remember
 
03:55:10.150 --> 03:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
reading it when you're setting up the
 
03:55:12.070 --> 03:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
meetings the parent doesn't have to but
 
03:55:14.070 --> 03:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
they have to have the opportunity to
 
03:55:14.080 --> 03:55:15.349 align:start position:0%
they have to have the opportunity to
participate

03:55:15.349 --> 03:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
participate
 
03:55:18.790 --> 03:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
correct um and it talks about the parent
 
03:55:20.070 --> 03:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
03:55:21.670 --> 03:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
it would be wise that we try to clean
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
this up a little bit in terms of where
 
03:55:25.349 --> 03:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
we're are we talking about the parent or
 
03:55:26.950 --> 03:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
parents you have to have permission of
 
03:55:29.750 --> 03:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
both of them to do something
 
03:55:29.760 --> 03:55:30.790 align:start position:0%
both of them to do something
um

03:55:30.790 --> 03:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:32.229 --> 03:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
i'm just i don't think i just don't have
 
03:55:33.510 --> 03:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
to have that
 
03:55:36.150 --> 03:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
right i i'm just looking at uh section
 
03:55:36.160 --> 03:55:38.309 align:start position:0%
right i i'm just looking at uh section
300.321

03:55:38.309 --> 03:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
300.321
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
um of federal law the iep team and um a1
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
says the parents of a child
 
03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
03:55:50.309 --> 03:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
you know i i reckon is your point but um
 
03:55:52.389 --> 03:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
you know yeah i i see it too and i'm
 
03:55:54.870 --> 03:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
looking at 322 and it says parent
 
03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
participation right but then you get
 
03:55:59.429 --> 03:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
down and you start reading it and they
 
03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
bounce around between the plural too yes
 
03:56:01.920 --> 03:56:02.630 align:start position:0%
bounce around between the plural too yes
uh

03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:56:05.990 --> 03:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
so i i understand that but this has been
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
very you know i've had a lot of conflict
 
03:56:08.550 --> 03:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
with it
 
03:56:10.950 --> 03:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
um when i you know one wants to bring an
 
03:56:12.309 --> 03:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
attorney in to do something the other
 
03:56:13.349 --> 03:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
one says i don't want anything to do
 
03:56:14.710 --> 03:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:56:16.469 --> 03:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:56:29.429 --> 03:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:29.439 --> 03:56:33.110 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:56:33.110 --> 03:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:34.630 --> 03:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
that that's not a term in new hampshire
 
03:56:36.150 --> 03:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
anymore the
 
03:56:37.590 --> 03:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's not a term in new hampshire
 
03:56:38.950 --> 03:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
anymore there's no such thing in new
 
03:56:41.110 --> 03:56:41.120 align:start position:0%

03:56:45.990 --> 03:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:51.030 --> 03:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:54.630 --> 03:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:57.110 --> 03:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
i have no more questions uh uh uh
 
03:57:00.309 --> 03:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
representative cordelia at this time um

03:57:26.070 --> 03:57:26.080 align:start position:0%

hi

03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
hi
 
03:57:32.710 --> 03:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
i'm bonnie dunham and i am here as a
 
03:57:34.790 --> 03:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
parent of a young man who benefited from
 
03:57:37.269 --> 03:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
special education under our current
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
special education law and rules
 
03:57:42.309 --> 03:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
and so i value them highly
 
03:57:44.070 --> 03:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
i have to say
 
03:57:46.630 --> 03:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
and i understand things happen but i am
 
03:57:48.790 --> 03:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
so disappointed that with almost no
 
03:57:51.110 --> 03:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
notice we are talking about making
 
03:57:53.510 --> 03:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
significant changes in our state special
 
03:57:55.429 --> 03:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
education rights and protections the
 
03:57:57.269 --> 03:57:57.279 align:start position:0%
very rights and protections that parents
 
03:57:59.349 --> 03:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
and children with disabilities have come
 
03:58:01.750 --> 03:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
to rely upon for their children's
 
03:58:01.760 --> 03:58:03.349 align:start position:0%
to rely upon for their children's
well-being

03:58:03.349 --> 03:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
03:58:03.359 --> 03:58:04.309 align:start position:0%
well-being
and

03:58:04.309 --> 03:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:58:05.830 --> 03:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
i've talked to several parents in the
 
03:58:08.389 --> 03:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
past few days none of them knew this was
 
03:58:08.399 --> 03:58:09.510 align:start position:0%
past few days none of them knew this was
happening

03:58:09.510 --> 03:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
happening
 
03:58:11.830 --> 03:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's not in the calendar it just says an
 
03:58:13.110 --> 03:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
amendment which you couldn't get your
 
03:58:15.590 --> 03:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
hands on until halfway through tuesday
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
and you had to go to the sergeant of
 
03:58:18.550 --> 03:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
arms office and then later it was
 
03:58:20.229 --> 03:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
available online
 
03:58:21.830 --> 03:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of people here for that
 
03:58:23.910 --> 03:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
mask mandate because they had months to
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
know about it to prepare for it this is
 
03:58:29.110 --> 03:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
just not fair to families to parents and
 
03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
i know that's not something
 
03:58:32.870 --> 03:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative cordelia intends to to be
 
03:58:34.790 --> 03:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
as unfair to parents
 
03:58:36.710 --> 03:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire special education laws
 
03:58:38.150 --> 03:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
have historically been reviewed and
 
03:58:39.590 --> 03:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
revised through very thoughtful
 
03:58:42.070 --> 03:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
processes that encourage stakeholder
 
03:58:43.990 --> 03:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
involvement the last time there were
 
03:58:47.110 --> 03:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
significant changes made to rsa 186c a
 
03:58:48.950 --> 03:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
work group made up of about one-third
 
03:58:51.030 --> 03:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
people representing parents a third
 
03:58:52.550 --> 03:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
representing school districts and the
 
03:58:54.790 --> 03:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
third legislators held a series of
 
03:58:56.710 --> 03:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
meetings and public input sessions
 
03:58:59.110 --> 03:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
simultaneously our state state special
 
03:59:00.790 --> 03:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
education rules were being reviewed and
 
03:59:03.429 --> 03:59:03.439 align:start position:0%
revised hundreds of people participated
 
03:59:06.070 --> 03:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
in those processes directly
 
03:59:08.229 --> 03:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
and more than 700 signed a petition
 
03:59:11.590 --> 03:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
supporting the language that we have now
 
03:59:14.389 --> 03:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
if everything in rsa 186c
 
03:59:16.229 --> 03:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
was should be
 
03:59:18.630 --> 03:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
the um should be the absolute standard
 
03:59:19.830 --> 03:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:59:21.510 --> 03:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have anything in the rules
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
that go beyond that then perhaps we
 
03:59:24.790 --> 03:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
should go through the new hampshire
 
03:59:26.710 --> 03:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
standards and pick out everything that's
 
03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
important to families and put it in rsa
 
03:59:32.229 --> 03:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
186c then it would be longer
 
03:59:34.790 --> 03:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
but that would no longer be an issue
 
03:59:37.510 --> 03:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
rsa 186e doesn't have detail it says
 
03:59:39.510 --> 03:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
children are evaluated and determined
 
03:59:41.590 --> 03:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
eligible by the iep by the school
 
03:59:43.990 --> 03:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
district it doesn't say who evaluates
 
03:59:45.429 --> 03:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
them how long it can take what the
 
03:59:47.189 --> 03:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
requirements are
 
03:59:49.830 --> 03:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
what what's prohibited that detail is in
 
03:59:51.510 --> 03:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire standards and and
 
03:59:53.110 --> 03:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
that's how it's always been and if we're
 
03:59:54.870 --> 03:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
going to change it it should be done
 
03:59:56.950 --> 03:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
extremely thoughtfully
 
03:59:59.429 --> 03:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
this amendment would lower many of the
 
04:00:01.189 --> 04:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
important special education rights and
 
04:00:03.750 --> 04:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
protections to the bare minimum required
 
04:00:07.510 --> 04:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
by idea idea is intended to be a floor
 
04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
not a ceiling
 
04:00:12.550 --> 04:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
and states are allowed to go beyond that
 
04:00:14.070 --> 04:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire does new hampshire
 
04:00:16.790 --> 04:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
complies with idea as we must but we
 
04:00:18.469 --> 04:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
also reflect new hampshire's unique
 
04:00:20.550 --> 04:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
character history and values by
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
including extra procedures that support
 
04:00:24.550 --> 04:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
parent involvement which research has
 
04:00:27.189 --> 04:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
shown is the number one factor in in
 
04:00:29.590 --> 04:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
ensuring student success in school
 
04:00:31.510 --> 04:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
they provide clarity accountability
 
04:00:33.590 --> 04:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
transparency they use sound business
 
04:00:35.990 --> 04:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
practices and include requirements to
 
04:00:37.670 --> 04:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
better prepare students for life after
 
04:00:39.590 --> 04:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
high school
 
04:00:41.670 --> 04:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
specifically this amendment deletes the
 
04:00:43.910 --> 04:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
requirement in 186c to include
 
04:00:45.750 --> 04:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
short-term objectives or benchmarks in
 
04:00:48.070 --> 04:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
each child's iep unless the parent
 
04:00:49.830 --> 04:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
agrees they are not necessary for one or
 
04:00:51.750 --> 04:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
more of the child's annual goals
 
04:00:53.670 --> 04:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
during the last major revision of new
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire's special ed laws and rules
 
04:00:57.670 --> 04:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
because they happen simultaneously 80
 
04:00:59.269 --> 04:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
more than 89 percent of people who
 
04:01:00.870 --> 04:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
reference short-term objectives in their
 
04:01:02.630 --> 04:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
oral testimony supported our current
 
04:01:05.349 --> 04:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
language i was the notetaker for that
 
04:01:07.349 --> 04:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
for that work group and i went to every
 
04:01:09.269 --> 04:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
single hearing in every single public
 
04:01:10.950 --> 04:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
meeting and i took
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
voluminous notes and so i was able to
 
04:01:14.710 --> 04:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
calculate that
 
04:01:16.630 --> 04:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
short term objectives allow parents and
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
educators to understand how a child with
 
04:01:20.070 --> 04:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
a disability will achieve their annual
 
04:01:22.229 --> 04:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
goals they provide a tool for parents to
 
04:01:31.349 --> 04:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
short-term success require them to write
 
04:01:35.349 --> 04:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
those steps down so that parents also
 
04:01:36.389 --> 04:01:36.399 align:start position:0%
know them
 
04:01:38.070 --> 04:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
several parents who testified said that
 
04:01:39.670 --> 04:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
short-term objectives were the single
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
most important component of the iep in
 
04:01:44.389 --> 04:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
enabling them to meaningful meaningfully
 
04:01:46.229 --> 04:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
participate in their children's
 
04:01:46.239 --> 04:01:47.510 align:start position:0%
participate in their children's
education

04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:01:49.990 --> 04:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
also because ida only requires those
 
04:01:51.750 --> 04:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
short-term objectives or benchmarks for
 
04:01:53.670 --> 04:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
children who take alternate assessments
 
04:01:55.110 --> 04:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
aligned to alternate achievement
 
04:01:57.910 --> 04:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
standards no preschooler no child who
 
04:01:59.510 --> 04:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a statewide assessment
 
04:02:01.110 --> 04:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
including those whose parents opt them
 
04:02:02.710 --> 04:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
out would ever have short-term
 
04:02:04.950 --> 04:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
objectives in their iep i don't know
 
04:02:07.429 --> 04:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
that that's what you mean to do or that
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:12.469 --> 04:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
some additional requirements that we
 
04:02:15.750 --> 04:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
have for new hampshire clear timelines
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
we don't believe in enough reasonable we
 
04:02:20.150 --> 04:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
want to know a number of days so there's
 
04:02:22.150 --> 04:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
no disagreement everybody has a shared
 
04:02:22.160 --> 04:02:23.510 align:start position:0%
no disagreement everybody has a shared
understanding

04:02:23.510 --> 04:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:02:25.830 --> 04:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
of what's intended beginning transition
 
04:02:28.870 --> 04:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
planning by age 14 is we go beyond the
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
federal law and our and more of our kids
 
04:02:32.950 --> 04:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
who finish school are employed or in
 
04:02:35.269 --> 04:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education after they
 
04:02:37.349 --> 04:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
finish a year after high school than in
 
04:02:40.150 --> 04:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
almost any other state
 
04:02:42.389 --> 04:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
section 3 of the amendment says that iep
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
team meetings should be scheduled at a
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
mutually agreed upon time and place idea
 
04:02:49.349 --> 04:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
requires that they must be scheduled at
 
04:02:51.750 --> 04:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
a mutually agree upon time and place
 
04:02:54.150 --> 04:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
section 504 about
 
04:02:55.670 --> 04:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
adds a piece that talks about
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and and all of that and
 
04:03:02.309 --> 04:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
much of that is already in 186 c23 but
 
04:03:05.429 --> 04:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
not not ndas that's that is not in there
 
04:03:07.349 --> 04:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
um and so it would make sense to add
 
04:03:10.389 --> 04:03:10.399 align:start position:0%
something about that um but
 
04:03:10.399 --> 04:03:11.189 align:start position:0%
something about that um but
the

04:03:11.189 --> 04:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:03:13.269 --> 04:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
section about parent rights access
 
04:03:15.750 --> 04:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
rights there's a there's an error that
 
04:03:18.070 --> 04:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
probably unintentionally reduces parents
 
04:03:20.389 --> 04:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
rights because most of that's in ferpa
 
04:03:22.150 --> 04:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
but new hampshire carefully considered
 
04:03:24.469 --> 04:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
and decided that we wanted to go beyond
 
04:03:26.150 --> 04:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
the minimum requirement in ferpa we
 
04:03:28.710 --> 04:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to go beyond that floor
 
04:03:28.720 --> 04:03:29.590 align:start position:0%
wanted to go beyond that floor
and

04:03:29.590 --> 04:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:31.590 --> 04:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
while that amendment requires districts
 
04:03:33.269 --> 04:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
to comply with the parents request to
 
04:03:35.670 --> 04:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
inspect and review records in no case
 
04:03:38.150 --> 04:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
less than 45 days after the request is
 
04:03:38.160 --> 04:03:39.189 align:start position:0%
less than 45 days after the request is
made

04:03:39.189 --> 04:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
made
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
rsa 189.66 sets a much shorter 14-day
 
04:03:45.269 --> 04:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
timeline for families in new hampshire
 
04:03:47.189 --> 04:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
to be provided with that access to their
 
04:03:48.790 --> 04:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
child's school records
 
04:03:50.389 --> 04:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
i think the amendment's flawed it
 
04:03:52.150 --> 04:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
lessens parents rights it lessens
 
04:03:53.910 --> 04:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities for parents to be involved
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
in the special ed process and in fact in
 
04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
their child's education
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying everything is perfect it
 
04:04:01.590 --> 04:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
is not but this is not the answer such
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
major changes in new hampshire special
 
04:04:05.510 --> 04:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
education law should not be rushed we
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
have a long history of respecting and
 
04:04:09.269 --> 04:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
involving parents including when rsa
 
04:04:11.910 --> 04:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
186c has been revised please don't let
 
04:04:14.229 --> 04:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
this amendment end that practice please
 
04:04:16.150 --> 04:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
either oppose it or refer
 
04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
for further study and if i if you don't
 
04:04:20.070 --> 04:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
mind if i answer any questions that you
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
had about what happens when parents
 
04:04:23.030 --> 04:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
don't agree
 
04:04:24.389 --> 04:04:24.399 align:start position:0%
really interestingly the office of
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
special education programs issues
 
04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
letters when questions come up like that
 
04:04:30.790 --> 04:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
because idea allows a parent to revoke
 
04:04:33.189 --> 04:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
consent for special education and then
 
04:04:35.030 --> 04:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
the question is what if one parent wants
 
04:04:36.870 --> 04:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
to revoke and the other doesn't and the
 
04:04:38.870 --> 04:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
answer is the parent has a right one
 
04:04:40.630 --> 04:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
parent has a right to revoke it the
 
04:04:42.309 --> 04:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
other parent has the right to re-refer
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
their child for special education and
 
04:04:46.070 --> 04:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
then the first parent can revoke it and
 
04:04:47.910 --> 04:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
so the federal law was unwilling to
 
04:04:49.990 --> 04:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
deprive either parent of the rights that
 
04:04:52.469 --> 04:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
they had and in doing so they kind of
 
04:04:56.150 --> 04:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
created a catch-22 that um that
 
04:04:58.150 --> 04:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
that they recognize osep recognized
 
04:05:00.469 --> 04:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
would torment school districts
 
04:05:02.150 --> 04:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
luckily it doesn't happen that often but
 
04:05:04.710 --> 04:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
when it does there is no clear answer
 
04:05:06.950 --> 04:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
and um it'd be great if there's like
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
politicians wrote it yeah oh they yes
 
04:05:10.950 --> 04:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
they did congress wrote it but with a
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
lot of input from people so that and
 
04:05:15.590 --> 04:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
they i think they didn't know there was
 
04:05:17.429 --> 04:05:17.439 align:start position:0%
going to be a catch-22 until it was
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
pointed out in that letter that they got
 
04:05:20.880 --> 04:05:22.389 align:start position:0%
pointed out in that letter that they got
that

04:05:22.389 --> 04:05:22.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:22.399 --> 04:05:23.590 align:start position:0%
that
representative

04:05:23.590 --> 04:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
i was just going to say that issue
 
04:05:26.229 --> 04:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
coming up across the hall and child and
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
family over and over again
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're describing that ping
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
pong back and forth and it was usually
 
04:05:33.830 --> 04:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
resolved in the courts in the cases of
 
04:05:35.910 --> 04:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
who had parental authority
 
04:05:38.309 --> 04:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
which is to go with what representatives
 
04:05:39.590 --> 04:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
florida's talking about
 
04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
not law not called custody anymore it's
 
04:05:43.990 --> 04:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's called co-parenting and that's why
 
04:05:45.349 --> 04:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
you can't use the word custody in new
 
04:05:45.359 --> 04:05:46.389 align:start position:0%
you can't use the word custody in new
hampshire

04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:05:46.399 --> 04:05:47.189 align:start position:0%
hampshire
so

04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:05:48.389 --> 04:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
but just i'm going to say i've heard
 
04:05:49.830 --> 04:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
that issue just across the hall in a
 
04:05:53.590 --> 04:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:54.469 --> 04:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
are there
 
04:05:58.469 --> 04:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
well there's questions reps and hobson
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:06:01.750 --> 04:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
and i will not profess to know
 
04:06:02.790 --> 04:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
everything there is to know about
 
04:06:04.469 --> 04:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
special education i did not have a
 
04:06:06.630 --> 04:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
special education student however
 
04:06:09.189 --> 04:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
um i was looking at
 
04:06:11.349 --> 04:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
the bill uh on the very first page the
 
04:06:13.269 --> 04:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
part in bold in
 
04:06:16.950 --> 04:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
number 17 through 20. it indicates uh
 
04:06:19.590 --> 04:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
that the parent of a child shall be full
 
04:06:21.590 --> 04:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
participants on the individual
 
04:06:23.910 --> 04:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
individualized education program
 
04:06:27.510 --> 04:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
is that um does that pose a problem
 
04:06:28.790 --> 04:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
04:06:30.870 --> 04:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
original language the word full
 
04:06:33.030 --> 04:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
participants does not pose a problem in
 
04:06:35.429 --> 04:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
fact may you want to say full and equal
 
04:06:37.670 --> 04:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
which you technically already are but it
 
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
might emphasize it more but on the iep
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
team pursuant to 34 cfr sections 300 321
 
04:06:47.030 --> 04:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
and 322 that's a problem because new
 
04:06:48.790 --> 04:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire has additional members of the
 
04:06:50.710 --> 04:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
iep team that we've determined are
 
04:06:52.830 --> 04:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
important new hampshire has
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
extra criteria to encourage and
 
04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
facilitate parent involvement in the
 
04:07:00.389 --> 04:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
process um and so
 
04:07:01.990 --> 04:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that some of that language
 
04:07:03.990 --> 04:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
would take away those protections that
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
were done so thoughtfully
 
04:07:09.269 --> 04:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
many with the consent with the agreement
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
of variety of a variety of stakeholders
 
04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we require parents to
 
04:07:15.830 --> 04:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
be given copies of evaluation results
 
04:07:17.830 --> 04:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
five days before meetings so they can
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
read them and be prepared not walk in
 
04:07:22.469 --> 04:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
and be blindsided the federal law has
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
not decided yet to be as progressive as
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire wish they did but they had
 
04:07:28.710 --> 04:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
not and so we do what's right in new
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire just like we closed the state
 
04:07:32.790 --> 04:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
institution for people with disabilities
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
and we don't allow people to pay below
 
04:07:37.030 --> 04:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
minimum wage to people with disabilities
 
04:07:39.269 --> 04:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
because it's not right federal law says
 
04:07:41.269 --> 04:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's okay federal law says you can use
 
04:07:42.870 --> 04:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
electric shocks on children with
 
04:07:44.550 --> 04:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities new hampshire says you
 
04:07:46.469 --> 04:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
cannot do we want to revert to what the
 
04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
federal law allows i think
 
04:07:51.030 --> 04:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
not follow up
 
04:07:53.750 --> 04:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to ask um
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
do you think it's necessary to have a
 
04:07:59.189 --> 04:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
lawyer at an iep meeting
 
04:08:01.510 --> 04:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
that was a bit shocking to me
 
04:08:03.750 --> 04:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
04:08:06.149 --> 04:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
i think most often it is not um
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes parents bring one sometimes
 
04:08:10.070 --> 04:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
schools bring one sometimes they bring
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
non-attorney um
 
04:08:14.550 --> 04:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
non-attorney members or representatives
 
04:08:17.110 --> 04:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
from law firms um and so that can be a
 
04:08:20.790 --> 04:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
problem idea allows that a parent or a
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
school district an lea can can invite
 
04:08:24.790 --> 04:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
others who have special knowledge or
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
expertise about the child um it's
 
04:08:29.349 --> 04:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
somewhat unfortunate though that the one
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
doing the inviting gets to be the one
 
04:08:32.790 --> 04:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
who decides um
 
04:08:34.309 --> 04:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
and and so that can lead to some
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
conflict but it but it's allowed if but
 
04:08:38.950 --> 04:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
they have to say that they have special
 
04:08:41.349 --> 04:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
knowledge or expertise in the analysis
 
04:08:44.229 --> 04:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
of comments and discussion um add on to
 
04:08:46.550 --> 04:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
the federal regulations that question
 
04:08:49.590 --> 04:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
came up and um and the u.s department of
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
education in their response
 
04:08:54.309 --> 04:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
discourages people from bringing
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
unnecessary people including attorneys
 
04:08:58.149 --> 04:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
to meetings they don't prohibit it
 
04:08:59.830 --> 04:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
because the way the law is written they
 
04:09:02.070 --> 04:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
technically couldn't but they definitely
 
04:09:03.990 --> 04:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
do discourage it
 
04:09:06.070 --> 04:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
and so maybe we could ask the department
 
04:09:08.309 --> 04:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
to issue a memo
 
04:09:10.229 --> 04:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
mimicking that language
 
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:14.720 --> 04:09:17.830 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

04:09:17.830 --> 04:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:19.990 --> 04:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
would you be willing or have you already
 
04:09:21.670 --> 04:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
and i haven't seen it
 
04:09:21.680 --> 04:09:24.309 align:start position:0%
and i haven't seen it
um

04:09:24.309 --> 04:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:27.670 --> 04:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
point out the exact areas like you did
 
04:09:29.830 --> 04:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
on the one full participants the part
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
that came after that the discrepancies
 
04:09:34.229 --> 04:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
that you see
 
04:09:36.630 --> 04:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
just as a list so that we can go over
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
them and look at them would you be
 
04:09:40.790 --> 04:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
willing to do that sure i have i mean i
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
don't have it with me right well i have
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
kind of it with me right this second but
 
04:09:47.110 --> 04:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not in not in the level of detail of
 
04:09:49.110 --> 04:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
the accurate descriptions that you that
 
04:09:51.510 --> 04:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
you deserve i could definitely pull that
 
04:09:53.429 --> 04:09:53.439 align:start position:0%
together for you though
 
04:09:55.590 --> 04:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
and i because i was the note taker for
 
04:09:57.429 --> 04:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
the committee that senate previous
 
04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
senator stiles was running to look at
 
04:10:02.070 --> 04:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
our state laws i have lots of
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
background about the discussions and how
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
some of these decisions were made
 
04:10:06.479 --> 04:10:07.670 align:start position:0%
some of these decisions were made
and

04:10:07.670 --> 04:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:09.030 --> 04:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
i also i encourage you to read the
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
comments the analysis of comments and
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
discussion and idea because it answers
 
04:10:14.870 --> 04:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
some questions it's it's long but it's
 
04:10:16.870 --> 04:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
fascinating reading truly
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:10:20.469 --> 04:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
we also have available to us
 
04:10:23.910 --> 04:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
to get a side by side of this amendment
 
04:10:23.920 --> 04:10:24.950 align:start position:0%
to get a side by side of this amendment
first

04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
current law in this state
 
04:10:29.670 --> 04:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
and that can be done and that what's
 
04:10:31.990 --> 04:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's what jen does and jen's
 
04:10:35.110 --> 04:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
background over in hawaii was attorney
 
04:10:35.120 --> 04:10:36.149 align:start position:0%
background over in hawaii was attorney
slash

04:10:36.149 --> 04:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
slash
 
04:10:40.229 --> 04:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
if that's something you could possibly
 
04:10:43.429 --> 04:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
do or not
 
04:10:45.429 --> 04:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
but it's something i see you frequently
 
04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
doing upstairs is you know current law
 
04:10:50.070 --> 04:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
to whatever we're talking about
 
04:10:52.229 --> 04:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
mr chairman can i ask that if jen does
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
that we have she included that federal
 
04:10:56.070 --> 04:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
law as well state law because i was
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
actually going to ask representative
 
04:10:59.429 --> 04:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
cordelli to because he said he was
 
04:11:01.269 --> 04:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
following federal law to tell me where
 
04:11:03.429 --> 04:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
he digresses from federal law so i just
 
04:11:04.710 --> 04:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
somebody i don't care who it is but
 
04:11:06.870 --> 04:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
somebody should say here's what's in the
 
04:11:08.950 --> 04:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
bill here's state law here's federal law
 
04:11:10.229 --> 04:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
so we can see the three different
 
04:11:11.830 --> 04:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
standards and understand the effect of
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and where it digresses
 
04:11:15.349 --> 04:11:15.359 align:start position:0%
from federal law whether we are
 
04:11:17.349 --> 04:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
expanding or minimizing well trying to
 
04:11:18.550 --> 04:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
minimize rights because you can't
 
04:11:20.710 --> 04:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
minimize under federal law but if our
 
04:11:22.550 --> 04:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
language is going to be less than
 
04:11:24.149 --> 04:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
federal law we should know that we're
 
04:11:26.229 --> 04:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
putting confusing language in there so i
 
04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that it'd be helpful if she
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
looks at both
 
04:11:33.429 --> 04:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
where we do more than federal law
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
more frequently i would think and that
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
for some of the same reasons that just
 
04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
been explained to us but there you you
 
04:11:41.429 --> 04:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
could do that with you know this this
 
04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
and this if you got a wide enough piece
 
04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:47.349 --> 04:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
well we just heard testimony about how
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
the cfrs that we
 
04:11:51.510 --> 04:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
this would actually limit what's under
 
04:11:53.349 --> 04:11:53.359 align:start position:0%
current law and even in some cases limit
 
04:11:54.550 --> 04:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
federal law and i just want to be sure
 
04:11:56.389 --> 04:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
that's clear so i think that can be
 
04:11:57.910 --> 04:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
added in right
 
04:11:57.920 --> 04:11:58.630 align:start position:0%
added in right
in

04:11:58.630 --> 04:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:12:00.389 --> 04:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we have
 
04:12:01.830 --> 04:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
the guide to the new hampshire standards
 
04:12:03.030 --> 04:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
i typed it
 
04:12:05.830 --> 04:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
where the regulations that we have the
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire standards in many places
 
04:12:09.590 --> 04:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
like this does refers to the federal law
 
04:12:11.670 --> 04:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
they just cite federal law
 
04:12:13.590 --> 04:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
and below each place that does that i
 
04:12:15.670 --> 04:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
included a box with the exact text from
 
04:12:17.349 --> 04:12:17.359 align:start position:0%
the federal law
 
04:12:17.359 --> 04:12:18.149 align:start position:0%
the federal law
that

04:12:18.149 --> 04:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
if changes are made where we do just
 
04:12:22.550 --> 04:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
refer to the federal law in some places
 
04:12:25.269 --> 04:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
and hopefully add plus
 
04:12:26.469 --> 04:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
because they that reflect new
 
04:12:28.070 --> 04:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire's values
 
04:12:29.590 --> 04:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
having a version of it that had
 
04:12:31.510 --> 04:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
something like that a hundred percent of
 
04:12:33.910 --> 04:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
the people who testified um the last
 
04:12:36.149 --> 04:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
time the uh line rules were revised
 
04:12:37.990 --> 04:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
found that extra piece that we had
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
always done to be helpful
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
if you have that information can you
 
04:12:43.269 --> 04:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
share it with jennifer
 
04:12:45.750 --> 04:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
yes so whatever's not in the box by the
 
04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
way would be
 
04:12:49.030 --> 04:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
state it saves some time and we're under
 
04:12:52.070 --> 04:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
this the timeline here of we exact these
 
04:12:57.030 --> 04:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
bills on the set on the 7th or the 8th
 
04:12:59.429 --> 04:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
so we have a week
 
04:13:00.950 --> 04:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
so you could but you could make this go
 
04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
to interim study and then you wouldn't
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
have just a week would you but i think
 
04:13:06.389 --> 04:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
we'd like to see it when you know during
 
04:13:09.269 --> 04:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
that exact session oh good god okay yeah
 
04:13:12.070 --> 04:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i know
 
04:13:12.080 --> 04:13:12.870 align:start position:0%
yeah i know
yes

04:13:12.870 --> 04:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:13:15.750 --> 04:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's very pretty isn't it yes
 
04:13:15.760 --> 04:13:19.670 align:start position:0%
it's very pretty isn't it yes
okay

04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:19.680 --> 04:13:20.469 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:13:20.469 --> 04:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:13:21.750 --> 04:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
are you supposed to be commenting when
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
you present
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:30.000 --> 04:13:30.790 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:13:32.950 --> 04:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
given the time we have it's not not a
 
04:13:34.710 --> 04:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
half-bad idea
 
04:13:34.720 --> 04:13:37.830 align:start position:0%
half-bad idea
um

04:13:37.830 --> 04:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:40.389 --> 04:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
yeah lunch has passed um
 
04:13:41.990 --> 04:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
getting ready for
 
04:13:42.000 --> 04:13:43.670 align:start position:0%
getting ready for
supper

04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
supper
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
so is are there any other questions from
 
04:13:48.149 --> 04:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
the committee for bonnie right now we
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
could we can talk to bonnie after we
 
04:13:51.269 --> 04:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
close this thing down a little bit if
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's something that further
 
04:13:57.030 --> 04:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
communicate with jen or work with them
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
no further questions good uh we've been
 
04:14:01.189 --> 04:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
done this
 
04:14:06.830 --> 04:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:09.510 --> 04:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
today jenna is that going to be possible
 
04:14:11.670 --> 04:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
to get something back by that exact
 
04:14:11.680 --> 04:14:23.269 align:start position:0%
to get something back by that exact
session

04:14:23.269 --> 04:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:27.269 --> 04:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
yeah bonnie was very uh you know
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
involved when we've done a lot of this
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
in the past so she's a resource which
 
04:14:44.710 --> 04:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
if i'm
 
04:14:48.149 --> 04:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
lobbying so to speak i'm speaking i'm
 
04:15:28.950 --> 04:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:28.960 --> 04:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
you
