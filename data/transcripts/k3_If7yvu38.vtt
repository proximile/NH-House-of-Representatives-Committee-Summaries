made the motion so if she's now on Deck
 
00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
I think the motion has to be made again

202312 the board has also asked for that
 
00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
to be postponed so that they have time
 
00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 align:start position:0%
to file a conditional approval and that
 
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
will need a jail car deadline as well as
 
00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
um item waiver okay all right so we have
 
00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 align:start position:0%
three items to postpone would someone

is has a late filed conditional approval
 
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
so the committee first needs to vote to
 
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
accept that late item and then they can
 
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
move to vote on the consent agenda the
 
00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 align:start position:0%

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
to vote to approve the late filed item
 
00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 align:start position:0%
first since the agency didn't file a uh
 
00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
waiver of the the deadline to file and
 
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 align:start position:0%

opposed thank you
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
all yes repr represent gr oh you're just
 
00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 align:start position:0%
reminding about
 
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
Medicine so these rules have to do with
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
the phys position assistant rules it is
 
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
the med
 
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 align:start position:0%
600s um an amended conditional approval
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
was filed um but there were still a
 
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
couple of questions that were remaining
 
00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
uh one was that we still had not
 
00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 align:start position:0%
received a copy of the initial
 
00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
application form it is the universal
 
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
form that the oplc has been using um so
 
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
that wasn't so big of a problem but we
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
did receive an actual copy of it
 
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday but the other issue was that
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
their renewal form is on their portal so
 
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
I was not unable to see how it looked on
 
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
the portal as compared to the universal
 
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
renewal application looking at my inbox
 
00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
it seems as though that was submitted
 
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
this morning but unfortunately I've not
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to look at it quite
 
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
yet and in addition to that um there is
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
a note to jail car on page three of the
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
text that section had initially been in
 
00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
the initial proposal
 
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
but then was taken out in the final
 
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
proposal however it being reinserted in
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
the amended conditional
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
approval pretty much verbatim for what
 
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
the statute says uh addressed my concern
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
that it had been removed in the first
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
place the next comment
 
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
um has to do with the fees on page four
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
of the amended conditional approval text
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
there's an unclear comment uh because
 
00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
these rules are adopted
 
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
the PLC 10002 fees um which there is an
 
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
informational note that I won't get into
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh at this time but
 
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
additionally there is current effective
 
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.869 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:49.879 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:53.350 align:start position:0%
[Music]
36.011677

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
so there's a conflict there but then
 
00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
additionally I wanted to to bring to
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
your attention that currently the board
 
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
of medicine's website says that the
 
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
initial application fee is $23 so we
 
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
have three different fees um for the
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
initial proposal uh and just on that
 
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
note on page five there's the same issue
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
with the renewal fee um they're adopting
 
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
the PLC rules which list it as
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.589 align:start position:0%
 
36.016222

00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
36.016222
 
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
$3 um I'd like to hear from the agency
 
00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:36.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
issue thank you um Madam chair members
 
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee Lindsay Courtney
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
executive director Office Professional
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
Li Insurance
 
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
certification so um currently the fees
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
that were recently um approved by jail
 
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
car um related to the PLC 1002s
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
established the fee of I believe it's
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
$175 for Physicians um but the 101s
 
00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
which were previously approved by jail
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
car establish a fee of $28 for the
 
00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.519 align:start position:0%
professionals health program which is a
 
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
different fee um that we are required to
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
charge um it's a mandatory fee um
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
required by Statute um and so we've gone
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
back and forth about how to essentially
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
um communicate this fee to lenses
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
because there's uh been a lot of
 
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
confusion um as to what the total fee is
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
um and if we don't specifically list uh
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
if we in the past we have listed the
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
fees separately and then people will
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
send in 175 and then they don't pay the
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
28 and then we aren't able to issue the
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
license so the
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
203 is the12 fee plus the $28 PHP fee
 
00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:47.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
ones okay that explains two of them
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
what's the third fee um so they
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
currently effective um medicine rules
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
that list out a different fee so
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
that particular rule lists not only the
 
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
initial and renewal but all the other
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
fees which is what I assume it hasn't
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
been uh repealed on an expedited basis
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
yet but I will let the board confirm
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
whether my assumption is
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
correct yes correct I think the
 
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
committee is aware that there are
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
conflicts in rules regarding fees um we
 
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
have attempted to start the process of
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
cleaning that up but the first step of
 
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
that process was to adopt a universal
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
set of rules applicable establishing all
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
fees which was the
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
102s so as we move forward with Ru
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
making for each board we will be
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
cleaning that up hopefully with a
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
citation incorporating the PLC 10002s
 
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:40.519 align:start position:0%
but certainly as it stands right now
 
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
there are conflicts in rules there are
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
also conflicts in in statutes as it
 
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
relates to op's
 
00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:49.639 align:start position:0%
Authority all
 
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
right representative Lon um thank you
 
00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:54.519 align:start position:0%
madam chair um looking at the scope of
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
practice one that was added back in that
 
00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
looks like that's rule 30601 which is
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
which is the one that currently is the
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
licensing fees um I'm curious that if we
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
adopt these rules does that mean that
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
the med 30601 fee schedule um will be
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
deleted from Rules I will have to relook
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
at the rule real quick but these should
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
be the med 600 rules not the 300s um
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
sorry not enough coffee this morning
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's okay um but just to confirm uh
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
that that's correct yes okay all right
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
and one problem solved and then the uh
 
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
last comment that I had on this
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
particular proposal is on page six of
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
the amended conditional approval text um
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
that particular rule has to do with um
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
supervision of physician assistance
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
saying that they will be supervised by a
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
participating physician however earlier
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
in the rules on Med 62.0
 
00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
3D that gives a specific exemp uh
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
exception to supervision which is if the
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
participating physician either leaves
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
the practice or is uh unable to practice
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
due to illness they have 30 days so that
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
uh exception just has to be incorporated
 
00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
in uh the
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:22.990 align:start position:0%
 
supervision

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:26.839 align:start position:0%
okay Tina Kelly um office of
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
professional Li Insurance certification
 
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
and we their suggested rule um change
 
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
language for that which we will add
 
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
in okay thank
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
you any other questions
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
comments representative leam um thank
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
you madam chair if there is no
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
supervising physician with a physician's
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
assistant because of those do they need
 
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
to notify the patient that there's not a
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
supervising I'm just it's it I just
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's going a little
 
00:12:59.470 --> 00:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
further a field so the statute silent on
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
that there is a statute that does allow
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
a physician assistant to practice for 30
 
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
days without supervision if those two
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances occur but it's silent on
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not the patient has to be
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
notified so and I'm unaware of if the
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
that Miss Kelly do you know if if there
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
are any additional rules on notifying
 
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
patients not that I know
 
00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:33.910 align:start position:0%
patients not that I know
of

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay I would just add for context that
 
00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
there was a legislative change I believe
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
it was last session there used to be
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
required explicit supervision and they'd
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
have to register with the board their
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
supervisor there was a legislative
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
change that allows a PA to essentially
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
practice independently with a
 
00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:51.759 align:start position:0%
collaborative practice agreement um but
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
there does not appear to be in statute a
 
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
questions Senator gray I moved to
 
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
approve with the
 
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
amendment okay any further
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none those in favor
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
I those opposed all right and thank you
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
very much for the clear explanation of
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
the different rule different
 
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
fees Madam chair yes I'm sorry I didn't
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
mention at the outset but our
 
00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
stenographer is absent today she's
 
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
hosting her son's wedding
 
00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:32.839 align:start position:0%
um so she will be doing the uh
 
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
transcript from the video and from uh
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
the minutes that we create so it would
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
be very important for everyone to speak
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
into the microphone so she can hear the
 
00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:46.839 align:start position:0%
video ah thank you for the for the uh
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
comment all
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
right P's Development
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
Authority um so these have to do with
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
the um PDA 600 rules um state-owned
 
00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
commercial peers and Associated
 
00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
facilities the uh agency did submit a
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
conditional approval that addressed
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
quite a majority of the comments however
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
there were still some small
 
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
discrepancies between the rule text and
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
some of the forms there were a number of
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
forms that were submitted with this
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
particular proposal uh so I have talked
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
with the agency they have agreed um to
 
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
make changes in order to address those
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
discrepancies so if it is all right with
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
the committee I would like to go through
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
each of the discrepancies and then just
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
give a potential recommendation for a
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
change and if the committee and the
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
agency agree on that then the committee
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
can um vote to approve this rule based
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
on the conditional approval filed and
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
then based on the Amendments talked
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
about in the oral
 
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.749 align:start position:0%
about in the oral
testimony

00:15:54.749 --> 00:15:54.759 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay so to start on page four of the
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
condition additional approval text um
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
having to do with the annual peer use
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
application and permit at the bottom of
 
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
the page the form asks for peer use
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
location and whether a skiff permit is
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
required um OS is suggesting that these
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
requirements be added into that uh
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
section in the rule
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
text the next one is on page five of the
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
conditional approval text regarding the
 
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
single use peer permit application form
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
the form asks also for the peer
 
00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
location um and whether or not the
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
applicant wants to use their mailing
 
00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
address or permanent address um as a
 
00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
means for receiving Communications but
 
00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
that's not in the rule text so OS is
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
recommending that these two requirements
 
00:16:49.949 --> 00:16:49.959 align:start position:0%
also be added into the rule text to
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
address that
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
issue also on page five um regarding the
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
annual birthing permit application and
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
permit form the rule text asks for a
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
business fax if the applicant has one
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
but there is nowhere on the form where
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
this is required um as the additional uh
 
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
the previous forms don't have this
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
requirement OS would recommend that they
 
00:17:14.029 --> 00:17:14.039 align:start position:0%
just delete this requirement from the
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
rule text um additionally for that same
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
form there's a minor minor discrepancy
 
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:23.799 align:start position:0%
between the rule text uh certification
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
language and the certification language
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
on the form the form in one place says
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
my placement but the rule text just says
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
placement so Os Os would suggest that my
 
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
be inserted into the rule text before
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
placement in that
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
section just two more on the bottom of
 
00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
page five regarding the daily seasonal
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
parking application and permit the form
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
asks if the applicant is applying for a
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
seasonal overnight in the parking for
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
Section um this is not a requirement in
 
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
the rule text and additionally there is
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
also another form that is specific for
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
seasonal overnight parking so it's
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
unclear why this requirement is on the
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
daily seasonal parking application form
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
as well um in order to address that OS
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
would recommend that that uh selection
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
the seasonal overnight just be deleted
 
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
from the form so it's
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
clear uh that there are different forms
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
and also it's consistent with the rule
 
00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
text and the final comment is at the
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
bottom of page six regarding the
 
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
seasonal overnight parking application
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
and permit the rule text is still asking
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
for the applicant to include the season
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
for which the seasonal overnight parking
 
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
is sought however the form doesn't have
 
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
a place to indicate that instead it only
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
says that the season shall be from April
 
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
1st through November 15th which is found
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
under the fee section on the
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
form um based on that OS assumed that
 
00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
there was only one season for which can
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
be applied for this particular
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
particular permit so OS would recommend
 
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
that the rule text be amended so that
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
that requirement is
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
deleted um and that is all that I had
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.159 --> 00:19:15.190 align:start position:0%
 
proposal

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%

00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
Services um so this has to do with
 
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
family centered early supports and
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
services the hm hm 510 rules um a
 
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
conditional approval was filed with the
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
division uh excuse me with the ol but uh
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
there was one additional comment
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
um that needed to be addressed um
 
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
for excuse me there are two comments
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed but one the
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
department filed proposed language with
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
us yesterday a copy of which I have
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
placed at each of your seats so you can
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
take a look um having to do with hem
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
51014 they have inserted uh new
 
00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
paragraphs G and H uh which addressed my
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
initial comment on the conditional
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
approval text um and therefore I have no
 
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
further comment on that particular issue
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh so the only remaining issue I had was
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
on page 37 of the conditional approval
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
text with regard to the waiver form in
 
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
the rule text it says that the era
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
agency the F cess program parent or a
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
provider May request a waiver of a
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
specific procedure in this rule chapter
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
however when you look at the waiver form
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
at the very top uh it's next to the
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
second Aster asteris it says that
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
waivers shall be submitted by the area
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
agency only so there is a conflict
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
between the rulle text and the form that
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed I have talked to
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
the agency about this issue and they
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
represented that they were going to go
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
through an expedited revision to forms
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
process to amend this form as it also
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
relates to 19 other different rules um
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
so they couldn't address it with this
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
particular proposal but they are
 
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
planning to revise that form and have
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
represented to me that they are going to
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
delete that area agency only language
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
which would address the
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
comment um but at this time there's
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
calendar and push Dees to the end yes
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
we'll do
 
00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
that so we postponed the other HHS rule
 
00:24:07.159 --> 00:24:09.029 align:start position:0%
that so we postponed the other HHS rule
fishing

00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
fishing
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
game okay so um these rules are on the
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
interference with hunting trapping or
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
fishing um they basically they new rules
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
and they establish a Prohibition on
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
interfering with hunting trapping or
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
fishing um the statute was enacted in
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
198 9 and amended in
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
2016 but it appears that this is the
 
00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:33.799 align:start position:0%
first time that the agency has moved
 
00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
forward with rules um it may be that um
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
they didn't have reason to do so I'm not
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
really sure um the statute does require
 
00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
that the agency adopt rules to
 
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
administer it um you do have a copy I
 
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
believe of that of the statute at the
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
end of your packet but anyway that's the
 
00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:53.559 align:start position:0%
only issue with the rule and so you may
 
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
have some questions about the delay in
 
00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
bringing the rules forward
 
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.029 align:start position:0%
bringing the rules forward
good

00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
morning morning good morning I'm Marty
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
Mobley I'm the legal coordinator for
 
00:25:06.389 --> 00:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
fish and game and with me today is
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
Captain Michael
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
Eastman um apparently neither one of us
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
were working at the department in
 
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
1989 um so we don't really know why no
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
one adopted the rules at that time but
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh we do have authority in the statute
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
to enforce the statute and it has
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
recently been discovered that the the
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
rules were not in implemented according
 
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
to the statute we've been criminals um
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
since 1989 and not abiding by the
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
statute but uh so I set about rectifying
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
that situation and have adop and
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
proposing to adopt the rules so that
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
law any questions
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
comments repr V um thank you madam chair
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much um as a land
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
owner that has Land open to hunting I
 
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify that lawful hunting
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
would only be those with permission of
 
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
the landowner and we wouldn't need to
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
exempt them in rules as well or should
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
we exempt a landowner if somebody is U
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
participating in unauthorized
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
hunting this would not uh exempt you
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
from not allowing certain persons to be
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
on your property at all this would speak
 
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
about harassment of hunters on open
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
lands okay thank you thank
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
approve second by Senator
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
discussion those in favor I I
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
opposed thank you and congratulations on
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.549 align:start position:0%
 
rules

00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
oplc um so this is an interim rule that
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
was filed by the oplc regarding license
 
00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:07.990 align:start position:0%
was filed by the oplc regarding license
by

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:27:12.389 --> 00:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
endorsement um the oplc had filed uh a
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
conditional approval and then an amended
 
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
conditional approval um which resulted
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
in me just having two remaining comments
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh the first is that informational note
 
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0%
regarding the PLC 10002 rules which I
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
won't get into uh but the second com
 
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
is regarding the appendix and I want to
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
start by clarifying that the appendix is
 
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
normally just an editorial matter um
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
that is addressed um either at adoption
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
or during
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
certification um however uh in this
 
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
instance we would argue that the board
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
statutes that have certain statutory
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
requirements for licensing should have
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
been included in this particular
 
00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559 align:start position:0%
appendix uh because the statute had
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
required oplc to adopt these rules in
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
consultation with the boards on what
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
would be substantially similar to the
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire requirements so if there
 
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
are statutory requirements for certain
 
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
professions in New Hampshire uh anyone
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
who is trying to get a license by
 
00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:22.039 align:start position:0%
endorsement should be aware of what
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority uh their
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
requirements are being compared to um so
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
because of that we would say that this
 
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
is technically a violation of RSA 541 A8
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
which requires adherence to the manual
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
requirements and the manual is very
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
clear that any statutory Authority that
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
is being relied on uh needs to be
 
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
reflected in the appendix and to just
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
further this point um I pulled an
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
example um from the um
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
mlc statutes uh RSA 330
 
00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
c16 requires that M ladex have at least
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
a master's degree and and looking at
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
these rules that requirement is also in
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
these rules um at uh PLC
 
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
31313 and in looking at that section as
 
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.909 align:start position:0%
31313 and in looking at that section as
well

00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
the statute for the definition of
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
um CL iCal hours or I'm sorry core hours
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
are is uh in that rule as well they
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
specifically cite that statutory
 
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
definition by referencing the statute so
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
that should at least be apparent in the
 
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
appendix um and that is the only comment
 
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
I had on this
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
proposal all
 
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
right thank you madam chair Lindsay
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
Corney executive director
 
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.789 align:start position:0%
Corney executive director
OPC

00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
OPC
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
um I I think we can resolve the issue
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
with the appendix but I think we
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
disagree age that the manual is clear um
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
and having reviewed the manual in
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
particular um chapter 3 I think it's
 
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
2.4 um regarding the cross reference
 
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
table uh directs agencies to identify
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
the specific provisions of state or
 
00:30:15.389 --> 00:30:15.399 align:start position:0%
federal statutes or regulations that the
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
rules in your proposal carry out or
 
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
Implement and I would submit that what
 
00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
we are implementing is a statutory
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
Authority granted to the oplc now
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
certainly that statutory Authority in
 
00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
order to implement that we have to look
 
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:30.519 align:start position:0%
at other resources which would include
 
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
State statutes but which would also
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
include State rules which would also
 
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
include other extraneous materials um
 
00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:39.799 align:start position:0%
explaining you know exactly what lure
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
means in our states and in other states
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
when we do that
 
00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:46.519 align:start position:0%
analysis the office is particularly
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
sensitive um to any um attempt to uh
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
claim for the office to claim authority
 
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
of the boards that does not belong to
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
the office I think the committee is
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
particularly aware of the sensitivity
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
surrounding this issue um as we've seen
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
numerous proposals come out throughout
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
the years um regarding which regulatory
 
00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:12.039 align:start position:0%
body should have authority to to conduct
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
a particular activity so um absent the
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
committee um asking us to include this
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
in the appendix we do not think we are
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
leg legally obligated to do so according
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
to 58 and the manual and also we would
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
prefer not to do so
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
um recognizing that the boards have
 
00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
retained certain Authority and that uh
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.559 --> 00:31:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
them

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:43.799 align:start position:0%
committee yes Senator um
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
so you say that how would including the
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
the this information in the appendix in
 
00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:54.519 align:start position:0%
any way detract from the authority of
 
00:31:54.519 --> 00:31:56.149 align:start position:0%
any way detract from the authority of
the

00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
boards so it's not necessarily a
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
rational position but anytime the
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
oplc has basically stated that we have
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
the authority pursuant to the
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
requirements granted to the board that
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
is not viewed uh very well by the boards
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
who are particularly sensitive to
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
retaining their Authority so I'm not
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
saying it's a rational um thought but
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that I think the office has
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
to be particularly sensitive to that as
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
we work to collaborate with the boards
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
in Partnership and we do not want to
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
appear to be trying to usurp their
 
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.629 align:start position:0%
appear to be trying to usurp their
authorities

00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
so I mean at the end of the day if the
 
00:32:39.149 --> 00:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
commit thinks we need to include it for
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
transparency then then we certainly will
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
um legally I disagree with 's uh
 
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
analysis um at least to the extent that
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
they're saying that the manual is clear
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
I do not think it's clear um but but I I
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
always want to weigh on the side of
 
00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
being cautious and not trying to over St
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
the bounds of the office's Authority
 
00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
versus the
 
00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
agencies I also just would like to
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
clarify one point that was brought up by
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
director Courtney the manual doesn't
 
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
require that every single potential
 
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
resource that they rely on has to be in
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
the appendex it is only State uh
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
statutes and then Federal Regulations so
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
those are the only two that need to
 
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
apply for the
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
appendix okay and I can agree that
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's probably statutes and rules all
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
over the place that might affect these
 
00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.509 align:start position:0%
over the place that might affect these
but

00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
um it it seems to me that someone coming
 
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
in and looking at these requirements
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
might want a link to where the ward
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
requirements are
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
because uh and that that's what strikes
 
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
me whether it's in statute or
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
rules um you want to say what we require
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
of our applicants and what we require of
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
people by endorsement so
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
you um that that would make sense to me
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
at least I think it makes sense but I
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
think without the committee saying that
 
00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
this is what we'd like you to do I think
 
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
given the Dynamics surrounding this
 
00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
transfer of authority the office is was
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
not inclined to do that um okay I think
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
they need to be transparent Madam chair
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
and put the information in the appendex
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
um like we said in the comment we could
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
ourselves amend that appendix it is an
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
editorial matter we'd much rather prefer
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
that they do
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
it okay so M chair yes so a couple
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
things this is also an interim Rule and
 
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0%
you're going to go into full-blown rule
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
making this is to implement legislative
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
changes that just were enacted that you
 
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
need to enact rules in order to enforce
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
correct things again like that uh the
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
endorsement the the substantially
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
different to allow out of sters to be
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
able to come in and practice in the
 
00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is that correct
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
yes and you are planning on going the
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
full-blown Ru making to smooth out these
 
00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
differences if you will and also to
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
include a number of other professions
 
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
right certainly this only has a this is
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
only a start right
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
correct we're currently working on rules
 
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
right now um and which would expand the
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
professions that are included but
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
essentially what we did is we we looked
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
at where are we going to get the biggest
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
bang for our book so to speak where do
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
we think the current endorsement
 
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
criteria is maybe um uh too onerous and
 
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
maybe we can or conversely where do we
 
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
have work for shortages that even a
 
00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:34.839 align:start position:0%
small change in the criteria um we would
 
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
see a benefit in this state so we picked
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
a handful of professions except like
 
00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.550 align:start position:0%
a handful of professions except like
good

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
yes okay anyone else um I I just also
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
want to make as the commit is probably
 
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
already aware but everyone aware that we
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
are in the process of amending our
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
manual because we have had a number of
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
statutory Updates this past legislative
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
session so if there's any
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations or anything that
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
agencies or boards are concerned about
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
certainly they're more than welcome to
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
submit to our office and we'll try to
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
include those in the changes and
 
00:36:08.349 --> 00:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
additionally the manual will become come
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
before the committee um with those
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
changes for public viewing okay and
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang is absolutely right the
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
change to the appendix can be made
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
during regular ruem they don't need to
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
do this now okay well we will in that
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
case not insist on anything for the
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
interm rule except that I believe we
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
have some comments from the public Mr
 
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:49.390 align:start position:0%
have some comments from the public Mr
ran

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
Cort thank you madam chair my name is
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
Steven rort licensed electrician in
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we just had some
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
concerns and uh we're passing out a
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
um some wording we're not really sure
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
like with regards to our discipline what
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
the actual wording is going to be I
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have it in these in
 
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
rules we submitted this back in uh
 
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
beginning of September to the oplc
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
lawyer Gretchen and suggestions it went
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
in front of our board last minute at the
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
last meeting and they had agreed with
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
this changes so this inum rule process
 
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
seems to be moving along like no with no
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
Gap stop and and it's kind of concerning
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
um some place like us as far as a
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
profession who already reciprocates with
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
almost 22 States has a pretty good
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
guideline is very open to reciprocal we
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
have no issues with that we encourage
 
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
that but we don't want it so that these
 
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
rules make it harder for somebody who's
 
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
living in the state to get a license in
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
somebody outside the state um some
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
simple things it was missing the
 
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
schooling it was some reference to the
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
hours they had four years or 8,000 hours
 
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
but you could work parttime for four
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
years and not gain the 8,000 hours so
 
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
there was just clean cleaning it up and
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
there was some information about the
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
schooling that's required for us to us
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
the substantially equivalent would mean
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
for example we require 576 hours of
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
schooling if they had you know 550 or
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
something there that that would be
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent if they had you
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
know 7,900 hours you know what I mean
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
that would be but not having it so that
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
they may only have a two-year program or
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
half the schooling or half the hours and
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
stuff so we would suggest and ask the
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
committee to accept this is the interim
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
rules going forward for at least PLC
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
1323 and uh I'm sorry um Mr Ring Court
 
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
first off can you spell your last name
 
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
for me sure it's r a n c o u r t thank
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
you and I just want to clarify this
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
handout that you provided are these the
 
00:38:50.309 --> 00:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
um suggested amendments your board is
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
asking be incorporated or it was this
 
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
just taken from what is already in the
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
proposal so I don't know what you're
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
actually looking at for wording now cuz
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
again lack of communication we have no
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
copy it was suggested this is what we're
 
00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:04.839 align:start position:0%
suggesting should be the full Waring it
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
had some of theirs in there and we took
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
from that but I don't know what you're
 
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
looking at now for from the original
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
rule um for the
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
Journeymen there's they add the WR the
 
00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
new number one is
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
new number two is amended to delete the
 
00:39:28.589 --> 00:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
years and simply concentrate on the
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
hours three is new and four is the same
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
as the as the rule and if if I may Madam
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
chair number one was put in there
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
because we have agreements with them so
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's just clarifying it that we have
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
reciprocal agreements with States
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
already that they would obviously get
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
the license by reciprocity without
 
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
anything else in them
 
00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.630 align:start position:0%
anything else in them
okay

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh I have one question I know that Maine
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
has a residential only
 
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
classification that is not considered
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
equivalent what in this
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
would would invalidate that uh that
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
position would validate or invalidate
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
invalidate well typically they limited
 
00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
license they kind of call it which is is
 
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
less hours half the hours half the
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
schooling ah okay is kind of how they
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
would do that it doesn't meet the the
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
hours of the schooling okay thank you
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee yes some motion I guess I just
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
have a procedural question so um again I
 
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
I think that these type of changes
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
belong in a regular rul making process
 
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily here at ja car to
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
Institute new rules that haven't been
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
vetted by anybody you know other than
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
what we're hearing today so I guess my
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
question is have you brought these to uh
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and has she that they
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
seen them to be did they consider
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
adopting them or were they just not in
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
the public in whatever process they had
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
for the creating the in you say
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner you mean Lindsay the
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
executive director executive director um
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
I reached out to uh the oplc lawyer who
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
was dealing with the Gretchen uh had
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
corresponden back and forth she sent me
 
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
the information I sent back the
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
suggestions she said she was going to
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
give them to uh Lindsay and Dave Doug
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
and um no one ever got back to me as of
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
even the last yes the other day I had
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
checked in with her and they had no she
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
had no information or responses we they
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
presented this to the board wasn't on
 
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
the agenda last minute right before the
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
meeting was going to cancel to try to
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
get the board's approval and it didn't
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
go well with the board so this is
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
supposed to be in consultation with the
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
boards but the board suggested what you
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
see in front of you and and gave that to
 
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
the lawyer representing our board to
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
bring to them and again crickets so I
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you Mr rancor
 
00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:01.670 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you Mr rancor
director

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
Courtney uh and before the director
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
speaks I I just want to let the
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee know that the statute does say
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
that this um in order to establish
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
requirements that are substantially
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
similar the oplc does need to consult
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
with the board so that is in the
 
00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:20.559 align:start position:0%
statute thank you I I appreciate Mr ran
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
Court's uh comments but I disagree with
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
the characterization of the process I
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
also want to clarify that Mr court is
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
not on the electricians board um and so
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
procedurally what happened is we prior
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
to initiating interm rulemaking we came
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
up with a draft and as the committee is
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
probably aware this is a this is a high
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
priority of the governor we were asked
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
to move this along um in order to make
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh make some changes in our state with
 
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
respect to Workforce and so um the
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
agency made this a priority and picked
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
certain professions again that we
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
thought um we could essentially create a
 
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
more streamline requirements so as soon
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
as we had a proposed
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
draft um we provided to the board
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
administrators Who provided it to the
 
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
boards now it's our expectation that the
 
00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
boards if they view this as uh important
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
will take a look at this and decide to
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
convene a meeting if they so choose to
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
do so um the electricians board did have
 
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
a meeting with their regularly scheduled
 
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
meeting it was on the agenda um and they
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
agreed with the feedback of Mr ranc
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
Court um I I I am aware that our
 
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:34.839 align:start position:0%
attorney has communicated with Mr ranc
 
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
court so I I disagree that there's been
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
a lack of communication there um but
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
specifically I I can't confirm that what
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
we discussed in our office was
 
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
communicated to him so I apologize uh to
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
Mr ranor if this is uh the first time
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
he's hearing this but essentially with
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
respect to the electricians board we
 
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
pulled up the statute which is licensing
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
requirements and and what it says is
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
after June 30th the board shall issue a
 
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
license as a master attorney man
 
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
electrician to any person who files an
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
application and meets the following
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
qualifications completion of 8,000 hours
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
of service as an apprentice the board
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
may give credit towards such service for
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
satisfactory completion of a course of
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
instruction in the field or a school
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
recognize the board this particular
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
statute does not appear to require the
 
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
education that is proposed and so when
 
00:44:24.549 --> 00:44:24.559 align:start position:0%
we talk about what's substantially
 
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
similar I personally do not think that
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
imposing an educational requirement um
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
is actually statutorily mandated by our
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
statute and so therefore we chose at
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
this time not to make changes to our
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
interim rules but I think certainly we
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
can go through the rulemaking process
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
the regular rulemaking process and
 
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
continue to confer with the
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
boards motion I move to approve the uh
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
interim rule as presented with the
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
comment that please work with the boards
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
to make sure that future rules that are
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
coming forward for final rule are
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
a little more Cooperative certainly
 
00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.630 align:start position:0%
a little more Cooperative certainly
Senator

00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
second second by representative Lim
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
representative Chandler oh so Chand um
 
00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:06.870 align:start position:0%
representative Chandler oh so Chand um
thank

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.630 align:start position:0%
thank
you

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
um I just want to you know if we do uh
 
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
approve this interim rule I just want it
 
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
noted that um although um we may not ask
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
for the inclusion of certain items in
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
the appendix at this time um for the
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
interim rule that should not be taken as
 
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
meaning that um we do not think that
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
they should be included in a final rule
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
agreed yeah I I agree with that
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
completely I think the the point about
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
having the reference uh being helpful to
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
people that are applying is important so
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
I I think that for the final rule it
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
should be in
 
00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
there okay understood we will make that
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
change so having discussed this many
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
times within the Edna
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
committee I think it's important that
 
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.990 align:start position:0%
committee I think it's important that
there

00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
are many legislators who feel that
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
although oplc has the authority they
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
also need to work in cooperation with
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
boards so I just want to make sure that
 
00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
because that's going to be something I'm
 
00:46:14.589 --> 00:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at in the future in
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
rules so that has to be that has to be
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
evident and it has to
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
be um
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
transparent certainly representative we
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
would agree that if I may just comment
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
um we are happy to cooperate um but I
 
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
think it's very difficult and for the
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
most part we have very good
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
relationships with most of the boards
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
but it's uh certain boards are very
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
hesitant and reticent to change and are
 
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
not interested in cooperating with us
 
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
and so um our concern is that uh we
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
can't drag Ru making and implementation
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
of our statutory directives because the
 
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
boards are not coming to the table I'm
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
not making a representation that that's
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
a problem with respect to this
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
rulemaking but it's generally an issue
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
so um I also think that the expectation
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
should be that boards partner with the
 
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
office in order to implement the
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
statutory directives that the office
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
has okay thank you any other
 
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
comments all right those in favor I I
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
opposed okay thank you very much and uh
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
have fun with the with the full-fledged
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
Ru making
 
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:38.829 --> 00:47:38.839 align:start position:0%
Dees okay so 2023 137 um fines relating
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
to hazardous waste management these
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
rules establish fines for violation of
 
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:47.720 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste statutes and other rules
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
um the rules expired in 20 uh in 2008
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
rather and the statute does require the
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
agency to establish finds via
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
administrative rule um in order to
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
enforce that statute the agency stated
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
in its notice that it received advice
 
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
from the Attorney General's office that
 
00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
it could enforce the inspir expired
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
rules however the agency doesn't State
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not they received that advice
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
prior to or after the amendment to
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
541a that explicitly prohibits the
 
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
agencies any agency from enforcement of
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
expired rules for any purpose um the
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
agency States in their response to
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
comments um that they have been
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
enforcing the rules um that they've been
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
continuing to do so and they've been
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
proposing fines under the rules using uh
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
using those rules as
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
guidelines um so clearly you know the
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
agency has violated
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
541a uh 22 um on not enforcing expired
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
rules and certainly the agency's actions
 
00:48:54.789 --> 00:48:54.799 align:start position:0%
are not in the public interest and um
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
they may not be fair are transparent but
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
those actions don't qualify as a basis
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
for objection and the reason why um we
 
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
we say that is because the language in
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
the statute says that the committee May
 
00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
object to a proposed rule if the rule is
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of the authority
 
00:49:13.549 --> 00:49:13.559 align:start position:0%
contrary to legislative intent
 
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
determined not to be in the in the
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
public interest it it's pretty clear it
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
says the proposed rulle so here what
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is past agency
 
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
action um in violation of 54 41
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
a22 so you know we understand this
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
result is a little frustrating and um we
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
are uh staff are looking at 541a and the
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
jail car rules to um recommend some
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
amendments to address situations like
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
this and we're thinking at a minimum of
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
requiring the agencies to provide a
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
report of all the enforcement actions
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
taken fines or fees assessed um during a
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
rules expiration but anyway that's the
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
only issue with the this proposal and um
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
with that I'll I'll let you ask your
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
questions Madam chair director I would
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
add to um what Kim has said in that the
 
00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
notice also indicated that the
 
00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
department was using two specific do
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
internal documents to determine whether
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
or not to impose a fine that means those
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
documents contain at least some rules
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
and they cannot incorporate those by
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
reference and they're obviously not laid
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.069 align:start position:0%
 
all

00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:29.079 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
right hello Pam Monroe uh appearing for
 
00:50:34.589 --> 00:50:34.599 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:36.799 align:start position:0%
I'm the legal unit
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
administrator my name is Carrie Barnsley
 
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
I'm a Staff attorney I work for attorney
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
Monroe one part of the explanation I
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
would like to point out um at the outset
 
00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
is that um I came to the agency in 2020
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
and during the pandemic now Comm
 
00:50:57.069 --> 00:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott suspended the
 
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
imposition of of administrative fines
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
when um you know vaccines came out and
 
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
and things started getting back to
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
normal um we commenced with
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
administrative fin actions and when we
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
did that we received a motion to dismiss
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
um in one of the matters that was before
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
the hearing officer and commissioner
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
Scott issued a he granted that motion to
 
00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
dismiss issuing an order and since that
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
time the department has no longer uh saw
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
administrative fines we have other
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
authorities to address uh violations of
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
um environmental uh compliance including
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
issuing administrative orders and
 
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
referring those matters to the Attorney
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
General's office for civil penalties but
 
00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
I just want the committee to be clear
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
that since that time um we have not been
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
issuing fines we're here today we were
 
00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
directed by the commissioner to fix this
 
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
issue to uh promulgate rules for for the
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
various statutes that do require um
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
admin uh rules regarding the
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
administrative fines these are the the
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
amount of the fines not all of our
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
statutes require that I just also want
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
to note that so this is the first of
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
other um substantive rules that you'll
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
see coming before you to address the
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
this problem um and I just wanted to
 
00:52:31.789 --> 00:52:31.799 align:start position:0%
make you aware of
 
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative Lyn yeah
 
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
so I I just want to make sure I'm I'm
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
understanding so am am I you you
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this um that uh
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott had issued this um uh
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
decision to suspend collecting the fines
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
in sometime post pandemic am I
 
00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
understanding that correctly or dur
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
either during or post pandemic post post
 
00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic we resumed um issuing we we
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
issue a notice of proposed fine and
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
hearing to the respondent you know we
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
have due process obviously and and they
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity for a hearing and
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
when we resumed that there was this
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
particular case that was brought forward
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
and the attorney for the respondant
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
filed a motion to dismiss on the basis
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
of the fact that the administrative
 
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
rules with the schedule of fines was
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
expired for that
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
okay and that that motion was granted by
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott we were directed not
 
00:53:33.309 --> 00:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
to continue that practice so what I
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
guess if I understand correctly the
 
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
statute that was referred to earlier
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
which said that
 
00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
um no rules can be enforced if they're
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
no longer in effect that statute was
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
passed in 2015 if I understand correctly
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
and so I my guess my question is what
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
was happening between 2015 and 2020
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
um when the P when the pandemic uh
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
happened I'll I'll continue but feel
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
free to hop in um before my my time
 
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
there um but they the the department was
 
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
taking administrative actions they were
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
proposing fines they were in those uh
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
pleadings um they were putting forth the
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
the fines that the the rules were
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
expired and that we were seeking fines
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
and a court using them as guidance there
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
were decisions issued by the hearing
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
officer that was a design of other
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um where those fines were
 
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
imposed and um that was that was the
 
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
practice so they're used as guidance
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
along with our compliance Assurance
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
response policy I ask one please follow
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
just one follow-up question the the
 
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
advice that you indicated you received
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
from the Attorney General's office was
 
00:54:58.589 --> 00:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
that was that advice received before or
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
after the 2015
 
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
statute good morning um Judge Lynn I was
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
the essentially the prosecutor of all of
 
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
the administrative fine actions the
 
00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.190 align:start position:0%
the administrative fine actions the
contested

00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
contested
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
actions uh since uh I started in
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
2004 so I was working for the legal unit
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
in 2008 when these rules expired at the
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
time I had no role in promulgating rules
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
but but the unit administrator at that
 
00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
time uh advised me that we could
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
continue to uh pursue administrative
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
fines under the statutory authority of
 
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to impose fines even
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
without the rules and we continue to do
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
so we continue to do our fine actions in
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
a very similar manner uh than we did
 
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
prior to the uh expiration of the rules
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
and in almost every contested case the
 
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner design
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
you know I certainly noted it in my
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
pleadings that the fine rules were
 
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
expired uh and in every decision that
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
the commissioner design made the
 
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
hearings officer made for the 12 years
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
that that particular one was there when
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
who was there in 2008 um he he noted
 
00:56:16.029 --> 00:56:16.039 align:start position:0%
that he noted that that's exactly what
 
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
the uh division was doing when it
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
proposed the fine and he took that into
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
account in imposing the fine uh
 
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the commissioner so it was
 
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
noted in every case and I do want to add
 
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
that more than one of our administrative
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
fine decisions contested decisions which
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
represents a minority of our
 
00:56:40.829 --> 00:56:40.839 align:start position:0%
administrative fines actions most of our
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
actions are done uh by agreement and
 
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
they have all the information we're very
 
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
transparent but as far as the contested
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
actions a couple a couple few have been
 
00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
appealed to the Supreme Court one in
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
particular um was appealed in
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
2020 and this particular point was not
 
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
brought up this very specific issue but
 
00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:08.039 align:start position:0%
the court
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
considered how we calculated a fine how
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
we proposed a fine and how that fine was
 
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.230 align:start position:0%
we proposed a fine and how that fine was
ultimately

00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
00:57:17.069 --> 00:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
imposed and it went through our
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
compliance Assurance response policy and
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
know went through our process in its
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
deliberation in this in in the order uh
 
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:28.039 align:start position:0%
and did not find fault with it so again
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
just for me professionally I believe
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
we've been doing the right thing and I
 
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm hardpressed to believe I argued
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh in the case that attorney Monroe
 
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned I argued for the division that
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
the motion to dismiss should be uh
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
should not be granted um I argued rather
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
vociferously because I've been doing
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
this for quite some time and uh I but I
 
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
really believe that the alternative
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
and and frankly it's the alternative
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
right now is for these cases to go to
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office and the
 
00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:05.559 align:start position:0%
Civil penalties and the process is much
 
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
more challenging than the administrative
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
fine process which is intended to be
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
like a small claims process and I have
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
always been very transparent about the
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
expiration of the rules and how we
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
calculate fines and and how we work out
 
00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:21.039 align:start position:0%
agreements the compliance Insurance
 
00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:23.559 align:start position:0%
response policy essentially tells people
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
how I negotiate for the division and
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
that's online that's public that's a
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
public document so uh so that's how
 
00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
that's how it has worked and that's the
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
advice that I received through my uh
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
administrator I don't assume to know
 
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what the Attorney General said I
 
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
don't believe their office said you can
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
continue to enforce these rules I
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
believe as it was transmitted to me it
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
was said is the commissioner can
 
00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:51.079 align:start position:0%
continue to impose
 
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
fines um and then we just continue to
 
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
use the rules as as govern
 
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines can I ask may I ask one of
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
the followup so so am I understanding
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
from what you're saying that in addition
 
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
to the statute that has been um referred
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
to that say that says the um the
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
department shall issue regulations and
 
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
establishing a schedule of fines that
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing in my understanding
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
that in addition to that statute there
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
is another statute that just sort of
 
00:59:23.069 --> 00:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
generally gives the commissioner the
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
authority to impose fines that is that
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
what you're saying or we we have many
 
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
statutes uh that authorize the
 
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner to impose fines and they're
 
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
basically subject matter oriented so for
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
instance the case that was dismissed was
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
a subsurface case a septic system case
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
and so that was brought under
 
00:59:43.599 --> 00:59:45.190 align:start position:0%
and so that was brought under
45a

00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
45a
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
4044 I think um 40 so in that in that
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
statute it says the commissioner has the
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
authority and many statutes read
 
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
similarly the commissioner has the
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
authority to impose fines up to a
 
00:59:59.150 --> 00:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
certain amount 2,000 in some cases it's
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
been raised to 4,000 some cases it's
 
01:00:03.029 --> 01:00:03.039 align:start position:0%
been raised to 5,000 and then in a
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
separate sentence it says the
 
01:00:08.589 --> 01:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall um adopt a schedule
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
of administrative fines so it it's
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
separate and I would argue that the
 
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
statute doesn't say if you don't adopt
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
the schedule which which they did years
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
ago uh if you don't adopt the schedule
 
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean you you can't impose
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
the fine and that's exactly what I
 
01:00:29.549 --> 01:00:29.559 align:start position:0%
argued uh in the uh objection to the
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
motion to dismiss a lot of our statutes
 
01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
say exactly that and and and I surveyed
 
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
other statutes of other departments and
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of their statutes are similar we
 
01:00:40.349 --> 01:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
have several statutes that don't say
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
that our Wetland statute and our
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
Shoreland statute does not speak to a
 
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
schedule of fines and our air statutes
 
01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
um have it the Matrix that you would
 
01:00:53.309 --> 01:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
have seen that was in our car that is in
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
our carp our compliance Insurance
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
response policy that would have been in
 
01:01:00.029 --> 01:01:00.039 align:start position:0%
the expired rule 610 uh and that is at
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
actually similar to the one that's at
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
the end of this rule that's being
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
proposed um you know that that Matrix
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
has been consistent and it's in the air
 
01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
a similar Matrix is in essentially in
 
01:01:14.349 --> 01:01:14.359 align:start position:0%
the air statute so different statutes
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
have have a slightly different method
 
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
for imposing fines uh and and again it
 
01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
goes primarily by subject matter and
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
attorney Monroe's idea has been to
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to redo the whole
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
block of of a dozen or more um
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
administrative fin schedules in in a
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
what's essentially a procedural rule
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
envc 600 um we're moving them to the
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
subject matter rules so now this
 
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
schedule of fines will be in the has
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
waste uh subject matter rules so the
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
idea hopefully is going forward is that
 
01:01:52.349 --> 01:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
it'll be just regularly updated as they
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
update their rules so that that's that's
 
01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
the idea of in terms of going forward
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
how how we resolve
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
this Dr moral um I agree that the
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
statute in question for these particular
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
types of fine gives the authority to the
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner to U impose fines but that
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
very same statute says the commissioner
 
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
shall adopt a schedule of fines which is
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
what basically you have in front of you
 
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
as a proposal um
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
and this is a fundamental basis for
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
rulemaking if you don't have authority I
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
mean if you don't adopt the rule then
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
the rule cannot be imposed and that's
 
01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
what has been done at least between 15
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
and 20 that they were imposing fines
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
that they did were could not legally do
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
221 Senator thank you so I guess I guess
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh and and again this is a rospective
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
look we're looking at in this
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
conversation right not necessarily
 
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
looking forward but going backwards it I
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
guess my question is maybe judge Lind
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
may have a comment on this but part of
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
me looks at these rules as being the um
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
a mandatory sentencing for lack of a
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
better phrase right there's a a list of
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentencing and in any other
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
instance if we took away mandatory
 
01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
sentencing it doesn't do away with a
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
judge's right to still sentence and so I
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
guess my question here is if we took if
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
we took away so-called mandatory
 
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
sentencing like this does it actually
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
take away the agency's over the the
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
overriding right that's allowed above to
 
01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.789 align:start position:0%
overriding right that's allowed above to
issue

01:03:35.789 --> 01:03:35.799 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
fines and and without without the
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentencing does that
 
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
automatically strike their their
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
abilities at any
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
fine well it it would conflict with the
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
current statute that does require a
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
schedule of fines uh it can raise the
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
issue of how the department determines
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
what fine shall be imposed for a
 
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
specific violation uh the statute says
 
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
up to $2,000 but how do they decide
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
between $100 and
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
$2,000 in the proposed rules they say
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
for this violation the fine shall be
 
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.630 align:start position:0%
for this violation the fine shall be
this

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:14.839 align:start position:0%
amount so the follow-up question would
 
01:04:17.309 --> 01:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
be with the with the expiration of fines
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
I know historically are are we've had
 
01:04:23.269 --> 01:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
agencies issue refunds and absent those
 
01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:26.039 align:start position:0%
rules but given the over the larger
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
Authority um of that they're allowed to
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
set up to a $2,000 fine um without the
 
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentencing so to speak does
 
01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:35.799 align:start position:0%
that mean they have to issue the
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
refunds good
 
01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
question can
 
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
I may I I think many of those uh the
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
programs the administrator finds go into
 
01:04:47.789 --> 01:04:47.799 align:start position:0%
the general fund just for your
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
information the um in this case the
 
01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
statute is pretty clear that um proceeds
 
01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:55.640 align:start position:0%
of administrative f finds Levy pursuant
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
to this paragraph shall be deposited by
 
01:04:59.710 --> 01:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
the commissioner into the Hazardous
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
Waste cleanup fund established by one
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
147b for this
 
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
one and that's why we're here to correct
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
this today did did did I I'm not I'm I'm
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
not quite sure that the mandatory
 
01:05:17.269 --> 01:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
sentencing analogy fits here I mean but
 
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
but the other thing is it did I
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
understand from one what a comment that
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
one of you made I'm sorry I apologize
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure which which of you said
 
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
this but that you were using even when
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
the rule was expired you were sort of
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
using the guidelines of the rule as a as
 
01:05:37.269 --> 01:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
sort of a template to decide what fines
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
would be and it it it really does seem
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
to me that that supports what the
 
01:05:44.829 --> 01:05:44.839 align:start position:0%
director is saying that the intent here
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
of the statute I mean I suppose you
 
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
could pull one line you know one
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
sentence out and say well that that that
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
gives General authority to impose fine
 
01:05:58.589 --> 01:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
even if you don't have rules but that I
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
don't know it sort of seems to me that
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
that is it's an arguable interpretation
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
of the statute but I'm not I'm I'm not
 
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
sure that it's a good one I'd like to
 
01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.190 align:start position:0%
sure that it's a good one I'd like to
comment

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
that two two things first did the
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
attorney gen General issue that guidance
 
01:06:16.559 --> 01:06:17.910 align:start position:0%
attorney gen General issue that guidance
in

01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
writing not that you know of
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
lovely also I can see you're relying on
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
that guidance and your expired rules in
 
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
2008 but when we specifically changed
 
01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
the law in 2015 to say that expired
 
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
rules cannot be
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
enforced I'm very concerned that you
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
decided on your own that you should
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
ignore that change and simply continue
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
working with your expired rules I I
 
01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
don't I I sure hope that that was not
 
01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
intentional I I worked for the
 
01:06:57.870 --> 01:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
Department for many years and I would
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
hope that we did not in so too but
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
that's certainly what it looks like to
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
an outside person I mean we we changed
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
the law specifically to prevent expired
 
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
rules from being
 
01:07:11.559 --> 01:07:13.269 align:start position:0%
rules from being
enforced

01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
01:07:17.069 --> 01:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
and your department for some reason did
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
either didn't notice that change or
 
01:07:21.309 --> 01:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
decided to ignore it and kept doing what
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
you had been doing is that a fair
 
01:07:23.359 --> 01:07:25.029 align:start position:0%
you had been doing is that a fair
interpretation

01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
well I would assert that the same people
 
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
that were were directing me to do my job
 
01:07:33.269 --> 01:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
in 2008 were still there in
 
01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
2015 uh including the commissioner I
 
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
believe um and that was not simply not
 
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
brought up to the best of my knowledge
 
01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
the intent was to starting in 2006
 
01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:46.839 align:start position:0%
because I remember the email starting as
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
far back as 2006 the intent was to uh to
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
to do new rules to re adopt rules um and
 
01:07:58.589 --> 01:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
they were had been worked on on and off
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge from 2006 through today
 
01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:05.799 align:start position:0%
and in fact in
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
2014 the new 601 through
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
605 which you just you just uh uh agreed
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
to the repeal of today um was put in
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
place and they didn't really include a
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
schedule of fines but they spoke a
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
little bit to some of the procedures of
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
calculating a fine and and bringing a
 
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
fine action um and in fact those rules
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
that were approved in 2014 referred to
 
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
like for instance the expired 610 The
 
01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:40.759 align:start position:0%
Matrix or matrices in 610 they refer to
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
expired rules and in fact that was one
 
01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
of the things that the very clever
 
01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
attorney who wrote the motion to dismiss
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
in my case back in 2022 which ended our
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
our practice um mentioned that you can't
 
01:08:58.269 --> 01:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
even follow that rule because it refers
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
to expired rules or expired fine
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
schedules so you can't even follow that
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
rule the 603 rule that talks about how
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
we calculate fines and those rules were
 
01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
approved in 2014 which of course I was
 
01:09:14.349 --> 01:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
very frustrated to see an emotion in
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
2022 because I was using the rules that
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
I was instructed to use but I will say
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
that I find it based on my life
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
experience hard
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
to accept when you say we are enforcing
 
01:09:30.669 --> 01:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
the rules against uh the law against the
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
statute because the fine schedule is
 
01:09:37.709 --> 01:09:37.719 align:start position:0%
just one part of what we use to decide
 
01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
which fine to
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
propose and like I said the majority of
 
01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
our administrative fine actions are done
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
by consent and those almost always
 
01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
include some sort of discount because
 
01:09:51.789 --> 01:09:51.799 align:start position:0%
we're negotiating a settlement agreement
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
and when I bring a contested action on
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of one of the divisions in front
 
01:09:57.550 --> 01:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner's design and I'm
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
using the the fine that we are proposing
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
that we are calculating that we've
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
calculated the commissioner's design uh
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
has almost never imposed that same fine
 
01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
they almost always take into account uh
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
certain factors they almost always
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
discount it so again it's not like the
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
fine rule said you got to pay $1,000 and
 
01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
we said listen where's our $1,000 we two
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
Madam chair we don't issue we don't
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
issue I would like to introdu Senator I
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
would like to interrupt this right now
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh I at this time would like to uh offer
 
01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
a conditional you know an objection to
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
this rule they're not ready uh they we
 
01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
need the department and we need our
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
staff to go and reach consensus and come
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
back to us we don't need to do all of
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
this you know that it's it is not ready
 
01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
for us to work on and
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
therefore whatever staff tells me is the
 
01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
right uh motion either to object or to
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
postpone uh I willing to make that after
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
they tell me which
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
one Senator Ling so Senator the great
 
01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
thanks for the comment again I I don't
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
know that there's any argument about the
 
01:11:16.669 --> 01:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
rule itself other than it's expired so I
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
think the rule is written is okay and a
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
motion to approve would be okay but the
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
question is what happens with the
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
retrospective aspect of all these fines
 
01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
that were issued while the rule was
 
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
expired is that correct I thought that
 
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
was correct until uh attorney barnesley
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
just spoke in saying that there are
 
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
other considerations they take uh and
 
01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
the fine amount can vary the way these
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
rules are written I don't see that it's
 
01:11:44.189 --> 01:11:44.199 align:start position:0%
this shall be the fine there's no talk
 
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
about mitigating factors or other
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
considerations so again I think that if
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
this rule of the pass these would be the
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
fines and there's no mitigating factors
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
because it says sh be fined and so that
 
01:11:57.149 --> 01:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
would be the new law of the land so to
 
01:12:00.629 --> 01:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
speak well so the these these rules
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
would be the basis for which we would
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
plead the fine but we still the
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
respondents still have a right to a
 
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
hearing and they present evidence and
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner ultimately makes that
 
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
determination but the the rules
 
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
themselves would be the basis for the F
 
01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
the fine that we would
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
propose so if I may that's not what the
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
rule says because again just pick any
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
one of these and it says that if you're
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
violate you know evh
 
01:12:32.669 --> 01:12:32.679 align:start position:0%
w3044 F the fine shall be $1750 per
 
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
inspection not conducted there's no
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
wiggle room in there for what the fine
 
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
is it says specifically this is the fine
 
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
there's no mitigation of that in in the
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
rules that you're
 
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
proposing well the process is to provide
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
for a hearing and uh the absolutely you
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
get your due process for yes or no it's
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
guilty or not guilty but you don't
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily get a anything other than
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know this mandatory sentencing of a
 
01:12:58.830 --> 01:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
fine right this this is the this is the
 
01:13:01.629 --> 01:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
fine if you violate this
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
law I I I don't know that the mandatory
 
01:13:07.629 --> 01:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
sentencing uh analogy not let's not
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.629 --> 01:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
that am I correct in interpreting that
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
these are these are hard and fast fines
 
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
once this rule is adopted they appear to
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
be yes uh there are often times where
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
with other agencies where you will
 
01:13:26.189 --> 01:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
mitigating and aggravating factors or
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
other considerations to take into uh
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
account when imposing fines uh I know
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
HHS often has something if there is no
 
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
dispute if it doesn't go to hearing then
 
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to get an automatic 25%
 
01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
reduction in the amount of f all right
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
does dees have such a general rule that
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
is you know given a a scale schedule of
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
fines this is how we choose to apply it
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
or what factors we consider when
 
01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
applying it we would apply the fine in
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
the rule and then we have adjudicative
 
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
um procedural rules as required under
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
541 a30 and we would have a hearing but
 
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
the pleading would be what's in the rule
 
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
all right so so you start with the
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
schedule and go on from there depending
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
on the negotiations is that correct or
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
during the during the hearing process
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
they may produce evidence that we were
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
not aware
 
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
of okay well
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's I have to agree that I I was
 
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
prepared to approve the rule and argue
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
your process or or the history
 
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
separately but it sounds like there are
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
things we need to understand as to how
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
this rule is applied before we we try to
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
approve it so does anyone have a motion
 
01:14:56.189 --> 01:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
can we can we uh postpone us um is there
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
a deadline on this October
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
30th so we could postpone us till next
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
month and take this back up and let them
 
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
submit a CA for for um you know changes
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
or some backup information on your
 
01:15:13.149 --> 01:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
procedural rules so that we know that
 
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
this is this is not a mandatory sentence
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
as it appears to Senator Lang but rather
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
the starting point for
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
negotiations right man just make I mean
 
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
it it sounds
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
like it I completely understand what
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
you're saying in terms of the way you in
 
01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
you know the way fines may be imposed in
 
01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
any particular case it it sounds like
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
you are you are not interpreting these
 
01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
these rules I mean even if they were in
 
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
effect you wouldn't be you wouldn't be
 
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
interpreting them as being sort of
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
mandatory although as it as has been
 
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
pointed out by the by the staff that
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the way they're work
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
word it so if you if you want to have
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
some for lack of a better term some
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
wiggle room to be able to consider you
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
know various factors in mitigation or
 
01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
whatever then the rules should probably
 
01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
say that um as opposed to Simply as
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang points out as to simply
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
saying if you do this this is the this
 
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
is the consequence no if Sands or butts
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah you you the rule ought to be the
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
language ought to be amended probably to
 
01:16:25.149 --> 01:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
say you know if if you do this this
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
happens except that we can consider but
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
we can also consider other factors
 
01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
mitigating or aggravating whatever um
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
which seem to me that would make sense
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I agree with Senator Lang
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
as in terms of what we should do now
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
okay I move we postpone this until next
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
right do thank you if I can just make
 
01:16:50.669 --> 01:16:50.679 align:start position:0%
one other comment I believe that in the
 
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
past we've also when there's been
 
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
mitigating Factor look to make sure that
 
01:16:55.709 --> 01:16:55.719 align:start position:0%
there's a structure so that they're
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
implemented consistently um so I would
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
be looking that when you come back that
 
01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:01.159 align:start position:0%
there's a consistent way to implement
 
01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
those factors or refer to your other
 
01:17:08.629 --> 01:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
that so just so I'm clear
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
um what is it you would like us to come
 
01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
back like come back what come back with
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
something better right so again I I
 
01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
think the issue is that
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
staff as well as myself think that your
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
fine schedule is a finite is a fixed
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
Point not a not a moving point and
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
you're saying it's being implemented as
 
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
a moving point so bring rules add rules
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
to this that talk about why it's a
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
moving point what makes it a moving
 
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
point versus shall be language that's
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
currently in the rule if you want to do
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
that if that's what you're you if you
 
01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
want to have that variability in the
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
fixed what I hear you saying is you want
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
to you want to basically have us put the
 
01:17:55.199 --> 01:17:56.430 align:start position:0%
to you want to basically have us put the
commissioner's

01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner's
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
discretion the commissioner has
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
discretion to decide which fine to
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
impose uh put that in rule whe whether
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
or not he can have discretion because I
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
will tell you that I argue that the fine
 
01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
that the division is proposing should be
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
imposed but very often the
 
01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner's designate the hearings
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
officer takes into account the entire
 
01:18:19.149 --> 01:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
hearing all of the evidence all of the
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
record and then imposes a fine that is
 
01:18:24.669 --> 01:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
not always is exactly what is in the
 
01:18:27.629 --> 01:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
fine schedule even before these fines
 
01:18:30.669 --> 01:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
expired so I guess my statement is that
 
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
process needs to be integrated into this
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
rule so
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
that if it's in a different rule please
 
01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
point out what rule it's in what we're
 
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about is that not commissioner
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
Scott but some future commissioner will
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
say oh the fine for this is
 
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
$2,000 but this is my friend you're
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
talking about so we're only going to
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
make you pay2 200
 
01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
you know if if it's entirely at the
 
01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner's discretion without any
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
guidance then it's open to
 
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
corruption I will say the emvc 200 is
 
01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
our process as then we well thank you we
 
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
would love to uh reference that as
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
well okay so would you like that in
 
01:19:16.629 --> 01:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
writing prior to the meeting for
 
01:19:19.709 --> 01:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
consideration okay we will do that
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
director moral one thing that could be
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
done is say this is the standard fine
 
01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
however it is subject to change uh
 
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the judicative proceeding
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
based on factors and then they could
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
give two or three factors and then a
 
01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
general catch all I mean the other other
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
case that comes up is that some naive
 
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
operator says oh finds $2,000 here okay
 
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
here's your 2,000 and somebody that's
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
been around for a while says oh I'm
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
going to appeal and and they all get
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
knocked down to 1,000 I mean that's a
 
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
sort of thing that can happen with this
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
rules so please the more information on
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
your process the
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
better okay we will do that okay thank
 
01:20:09.629 --> 01:20:09.639 align:start position:0%
you all right is there anything
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
item so this is an objection response um
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
 
01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
Services regarding the Foster family
 
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
care licensing
 
01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
requirements um there is one written
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
comment in the objection response
 
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
meeting packet that is posted online
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
however after putting that packet
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
together and posting and having
 
01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:40.950 align:start position:0%
together and posting and having
additional

01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
conversations uh with the agency I do
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
have one additional comment um that the
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
agency is aware of but I will go over
 
01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.550 align:start position:0%
agency is aware of but I will go over
that

01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
orally um but to start just to remind
 
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
that the objection was based on three
 
01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
points the first was the rule was
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
unclear due to the agency not being
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
clear of when the application is
 
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
completed in order for the agency to
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
issue a decision within 60 days to
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
comply with RSA 541
 
01:21:14.189 --> 01:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
a29 looking at the response I did not
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
see um any reason for this uh point to
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
be upheld they did make a change to that
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
they made it clear when exactly this
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
considered complete and then in the rule
 
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
itself says that a decision will be
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
issued after either the completion of
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
that application within 6 days or within
 
01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:35.639 align:start position:0%
60 days after receiving additional
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
information should it be requested so I
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
think that point has been taken care of
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
the second point that the signed
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement um in he C 644 6.06
 
01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
d1a may be against the public interest
 
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
due to to the lack of protection for the
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
applicant's health care information when
 
01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
it is disclosed to the Department's
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
providers the agency also addressed this
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
in their response they reworded the
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
language to state that even if this
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
protected health information were to be
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
given to uh redisclose to a contracted
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
um party that it would still be under
 
01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
the protection of the state and federal
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
law the issue last time was there was a
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
line in it that said that should this be
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
disclosed it could um no longer be
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
protected under the federal law and in
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
looking in that
 
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
closer um the federal statute does State
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
um that if someone is going to authorize
 
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
the disclosure of their personal health
 
01:22:51.629 --> 01:22:51.639 align:start position:0%
information that the disclosure is
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
required to
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
say and notify the person who is
 
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
authorizing the disclosure that the
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
potential for information disclosed
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the authorization to be
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
subject to redisclosure by the recipient
 
01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
no longer may be protected by this
 
01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
subpart so this subpart would be Hippa
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
that's that statement that's in the
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
certification so the department has made
 
01:23:17.629 --> 01:23:17.639 align:start position:0%
it clear that this information may not
 
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
no longer be protected under Hippa which
 
01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
allows the doctor to disclose the
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
information but the information still
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
will be protected under state and
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
federal laws as they apply so I think
 
01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:31.239 align:start position:0%
that also has been taken care of so it's
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
the last issue um that I think still
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be uh addressed and that is
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
that um HC 6
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
44614 May no longer be enforcable due to
 
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
HB 48 becoming effective once it's
 
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor um that bill was
 
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor it's now now in
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
statute is RSA 170e
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
27b and in looking at the language
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
um I I think there is some still some
 
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
problems that may be fixable the first
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
comment that is the written comment on
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
page seven of the objection response I
 
01:24:15.629 --> 01:24:15.639 align:start position:0%
think could be fixed if it's
 
01:24:19.709 --> 01:24:19.719 align:start position:0%
rewarded um because as it's written now
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
um it says all household members who may
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
caregivers are required to have these
 
01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:27.639 align:start position:0%
certain vaccinations should they be
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
caring for infants or infants or
 
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
children with uh disabilities I think
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
that needs to be rewarded to make it
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
clear that it's only adults who are
 
01:24:39.109 --> 01:24:39.119 align:start position:0%
caregivers to ensure
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
that you know 16-year-old uh 17-year-old
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
who happens to be watching the child
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
acting as a caregiver is not required to
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
have these immunizations because they're
 
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
not statutorily required and they're not
 
01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
required under the agency's rules rules
 
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
for other children other schoolage
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
children um which would be in violation
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
of this new law so I believe that needs
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
to be fixed I have had a conversation
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:25:04.990 --> 01:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
agency they agreed um that that could be
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
rewarded better and and that they'd be
 
01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
willing to look into that more um the
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
second comment I have that is not
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
written uh in the packet um is also an
 
01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
unclear comment um but based on the what
 
01:25:21.109 --> 01:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
is intended it could also potentially be
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
a legislative intent
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
comment so the issue is that the way
 
01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.149 align:start position:0%
comment so the issue is that the way
it's

01:25:27.149 --> 01:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
written could mean two different things
 
01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
the first is
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
that the requirements in the rule which
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
is you know the immunizations be
 
01:25:41.109 --> 01:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
consistent with the recommendations of
 
01:25:43.229 --> 01:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
the American Academy of Pediatrics the
 
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
advisory committee on immunization
 
01:25:47.629 --> 01:25:47.639 align:start position:0%
practices of the Center for Disease
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
Control another
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
organization I had originally read that
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
to mean that the dosage amounts the age
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
that these immunizations have to be
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
given those type of requirements those
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
type of recommendations is what was
 
01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
intended if that was the intent then it
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
is fine as written because the agency
 
01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
well it it could be rwind to make it
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
clear but the intent is fine because the
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
agency does have um a rule
 
01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
specifically stating that this
 
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
requirement is for all children in the
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
state all schoolage children in the
 
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
state and therefore would not be in
 
01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:25.400 align:start position:0%
violation of the statute so that would
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
just be a simple
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
rewarding however if the intent is that
 
01:26:32.109 --> 01:26:32.119 align:start position:0%
the recommendations would also include
 
01:26:33.790 --> 01:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
the types of
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinations that would be against the
 
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
legislative intent of this newly enacted
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
statute because the statute says that
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
children who are in the household
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
whether they are foster children or
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
biological children any child in the
 
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
home that is um sub who is essentially
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
caring for these foster children um need
 
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
to only be required to have the same
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
immunizations in the same manner as
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
every other schoolage child and if these
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations in the rule as written
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
intends to have additional vaccinations
 
01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
that is a legislative intent issue um so
 
01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
I had been in communication with the
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
agency unfortunately I didn't get an
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
answer of what was intended with this
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
particular paragraph so I can't say
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
whether it is simply unclear or unclear
 
01:27:25.629 --> 01:27:25.639 align:start position:0%
in legislative intent I'm sure the
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
agency can clarify that but as I stated
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
if it's meant to be intended the first
 
01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
way this could also just be fixed
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
because it um by being Rewritten
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise I would recommend um that the
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee look at making this a final
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
objection based on that legislative uh
 
01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:45.270 align:start position:0%
objection based on that legislative uh
intent

01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:27:49.109 --> 01:27:49.119 align:start position:0%
issue hello hi good morning afternoon
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Alison radme uh the
 
01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
administr Ator for the administrative Ru
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
rules unit at the Department of Health
 
01:27:59.070 --> 01:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
and Human Services um attorney reard is
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh correct in her interpretation um that
 
01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
is more of a Clarity issue with respect
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
to the vaccinations required for the
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
children um it is our intent that they
 
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
only have the required vaccinations as
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
the same as school age children um so at
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
this point the department uh would
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
actually like to request a revised
 
01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection uh to amend
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph h 2 and three to add uh adult
 
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
before household members to uh satisfy
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
the original unclear comment and then um
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
add language to clarify that no
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are required other than
 
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
what is required for school AG children
 
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
in our state thank you because I believe
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
that is the legislative
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
intent um and now that the agency has
 
01:28:49.629 --> 01:28:49.639 align:start position:0%
requested a revise the committee would
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
vote on whether to issue that revised
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
objection and then the agency will have
 
01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to fix that okay are
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
there any other questions before we do
 
01:29:01.109 --> 01:29:01.119 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry can I just ask question
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
for cloud to make sure I'm understanding
 
01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
if if we add the if if in H2 and three
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
we add the word
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
adult is that does
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
that it somehow suggests that adults
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to be that that to be a
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
caregiver you don't have to be an adult
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
and and is that and is that is that what
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
is intended um so for these particular
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
set of rules one of the reasons that it
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
was unclear is because there's no
 
01:29:36.669 --> 01:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
definition of what a caregiver is if the
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
there was a definition and it said only
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
adults then that would make it clear
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that's what's intended so I agree
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
that you know what is a caregiver is up
 
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
for interpretation however by adding
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
adult household members who are
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
caregivers I do not believe that it
 
01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
would make it sound as though only
 
01:29:58.830 --> 01:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
adults could be caregivers because it's
 
01:30:01.950 --> 01:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
specifically speaking that these
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
immunizations are required for this
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
certain set of people not that these set
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
of people can only be no I so in other
 
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
words what I was concerned about is that
 
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere else somewhere else in this
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
rule it said only adults can be S
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
caregivers but you're saying it doesn't
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
say that unfortunately not and that's
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
why it's it's unclear yes okay okay got
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
representa Le um thank you madam chair
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
and I do want to clarify we're looking
 
01:30:26.590 --> 01:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
to also make sure that the exemption um
 
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
under 141c 20- C applies to sections two
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
and three as
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
well um so if they put in adults in two
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
and three that makes it clear that those
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
immunizations are only required for
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
adults and not for children um and the
 
01:30:46.719 --> 01:30:47.830 align:start position:0%
adults and not for children um and the
RSA

01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
441 uh
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
c20a is specific that the exemptions are
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
for schoolage children and not for
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
adults I'm not clear about what statute
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
would require uh or would exempt adults
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
from certain immunizations because I
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's any law requiring
 
01:31:09.790 --> 01:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
adults to be immunized um unless I'm
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding your question um thank
 
01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
you that was the big debate over the
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
last few years about whether or not
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
there was a religious exemption for
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
adults currently there are no mandate
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
mandates for influenza vaccine for for
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
adults or for anybody um and so then
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's the concern about whether this
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
would prohibit a religious exemption for
 
01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
um influenza or for anything else um and
 
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
I would want to make sure that that is
 
01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
clear um I will I will follow up if
 
01:31:39.149 --> 01:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
there are if we do have a statute that
 
01:31:43.109 --> 01:31:43.119 align:start position:0%
specifically refers to adult um adult
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
medical sorry adult religious and
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
medical exemptions which I believe we
 
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
have and I can let the agency clarify I
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
believe that this rule is actually going
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
to be brought before the committee again
 
01:31:59.070 --> 01:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
next year um because there are more U
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
revisions that will be done um if that's
 
01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
something that the committee wants to
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
address with them when it comes around
 
01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
again that certainly is something that
 
01:32:08.109 --> 01:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
we can keep in mind and keep on our
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
radar however with regard
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
to um you know the the
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
objection there those three points are
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
kind of what we're limited to at this
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
point that sounds like a new Point
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
that's being brought up and UNT at this
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
time I I and director moral can correct
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
me but I believe objection responses
 
01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
only have to address what's in the
 
01:32:30.669 --> 01:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
objection so because at that time it's
 
01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
outside the scope um we could certainly
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
make it a recommendation that that's
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
something they consider when they come
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
forward with their new rule but I I
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's something the
 
01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
committee could really um address at
 
01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:43.990 align:start position:0%
committee could really um address at
this

01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
time Rich
 
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
moral excuse me that's correct uh once
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
you issue a preliminary objection any
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
response uh the committee cannot
 
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
subsequently add new items for objection
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
unless the objection response itself
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
creates a new basis for objection yes
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
and just as a followup I thought that
 
01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
that applied to adults that's why I was
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
making this point not a problem and so
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so by adding adults it would
 
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
address that original issue whether or
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
not an exemption for adults once
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
again that may have been something that
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
could have been brought up originally
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
because it had specified all household
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
caregivers and that's not something we
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
really discussed the first time around
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
however if it's going to be revised to
 
01:33:31.709 --> 01:33:31.719 align:start position:0%
say adults only
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'm unsure if if that would be a reason
 
01:33:37.109 --> 01:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly I could talk to the
 
01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
director about that um I I think that
 
01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
right now we're making very very
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
significant process we'll work on the
 
01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
adult part as we move forward and if I
 
01:33:46.629 --> 01:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
may make um a motion to accept with all
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
of these changes or sorry if I can move
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
as suggested I would okay okay so we're
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
moving a revised objection so that the
 
01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
agency can make these s agreed on
 
01:34:01.679 --> 01:34:03.629 align:start position:0%
agency can make these s agreed on
Corrections

01:34:03.629 --> 01:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
Corrections
 
01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
and I'll second the motion is there any
 
01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
discussion we have to point ah yes
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative grota you're in for
 
01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.390 align:start position:0%
representative grota you're in for
Senator

01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
01:34:19.149 --> 01:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
Lang um and and just so the revised
 
01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
objection response I understand the
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
points for that but did you also want to
 
01:34:25.950 --> 01:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
add on the recommendation that moving
 
01:34:28.590 --> 01:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
forward for new rulem that they consider
 
01:34:31.109 --> 01:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
whether adults should be exempt yes
 
01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
please okay sure thank you okay any
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
further comments questions all right
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
those in favor I
 
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you very
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
out what we
 
01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:52.830 align:start position:0%
out what we
did

01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:56.750 align:start position:0%
did
all

01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
right so other
 
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
business under other business you should
 
01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
have in front of you three uh different
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
forms uh for newer members as part of
 
01:35:11.950 --> 01:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
the manual we have uh a dozen plus forms
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
that agencies are required to use for
 
01:35:17.550 --> 01:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
specific rulemaking actions uh because
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
of amendments to house bill I mean
 
01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
because of amendments to
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
541a uh instituted by House Bill
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
358 there are needed changes for the
 
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
rules uh these three that are in front
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
of you need to be done approved they've
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
already been approved by the director of
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
legislative services but they need Jael
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
cars approval uh we're going to have
 
01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
another 10 or so that will be before you
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
at the October Meeting House Bill 358
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
does take effect October 3rd but those
 
01:35:52.109 --> 01:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
other forms are not need Ed before the
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
committee's meeting in
 
01:35:54.239 --> 01:35:57.629 align:start position:0%
committee's meeting in
October

01:35:57.629 --> 01:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
okay additionally we have uh a couple of
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
memorandums from boards and I'll let uh
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
Rebecca address those before before then
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
could you go if we have to approve these
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
could you uh give us a quick summary of
 
01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
what the changes are to these
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
rules sure um I I can do that um so so
 
01:36:21.870 --> 01:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
first one is the uh cover sheet for the
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
proposed inter room Rule and you'll see
 
01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
there are some track changes um like uh
 
01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:29.320 align:start position:0%
director moral was saying um the form
 
01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
has been amended to comply with um the
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
the new language um from HB 358 you'll
 
01:36:37.870 --> 01:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
see that number nine it says it's
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
requiring the submission of agency forms
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh right above that we've put in some
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
new language and that is not um as a
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
result of House Bill 358 but it is
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
something that we thought we would do at
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
this time and that says um whether the
 
01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
rules um being proposed are implementing
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
a state statute for the first time so
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
that would get at the situation that we
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
had today with the fishing game rule and
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
we've added that same language on the
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
interim rule notice um so that form
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
didn't really need any amendments as a
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
result of HB 358 but we did at this time
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead and stick this new language in
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
there and you'll see that in number
 
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
eight and then on the um the notice for
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
expedited Vision to agency forms uh this
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
one has been amended to um in compliance
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
with HB
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
358 and um there they've got to indicate
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
what rule number is being impacted and
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not the uh the rule text
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
itself is being amended or read-option
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
with amend Amendment and so we've also
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
done some um some information some
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
explanatory explanations if you will how
 
01:37:49.589 --> 01:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
to fill out this form uh so that's you
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
know new on the second page page there
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
um it kind of outlines for the agencies
 
01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
how to complete that you know how how to
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
say whether or not the type of action
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
for the rule is either an amendment or a
 
01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
read-option with Amendment so um that's
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
a quick summary of of the changes to
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
those three
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
forms okay does someone wish to make a
 
01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:15.080 align:start position:0%

01:38:20.119 --> 01:38:21.870 align:start position:0%
okay any
discussion

01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:38:27.149 --> 01:38:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
oppos and on to the on to the letters
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
from the agencies yes so I'll I'll make
 
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
this very brief um the first one has to
 
01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
do with the mechanical licensing board
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh during the last meeting the committee
 
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
had some questions about how the board
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
establishes whether a person is mental
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
mentally or physically competent to
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
practice um based on the application
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
questions this this was the memo that
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
was submitted by the board and it
 
01:38:59.550 --> 01:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
essentially says that they rely on the
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the criminal uh
 
01:39:04.589 --> 01:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
whether or not someone's been convicted
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
of any criminal
 
01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
um I apologize and have a criminal
 
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
conviction that relates to physical or
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
mental uh component um whether or not
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
they've had uh discipline in other
 
01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:22.070 align:start position:0%
they've had uh discipline in other
jurisdic

01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdic
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
based on physical or mental components
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
um so those seem to be really the only
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
set of questions that they rely on
 
01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing more in depth than that
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
um and then the second one is from the
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
real estate appraiser board um there was
 
01:39:42.270 --> 01:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
a question about whether or not the
 
01:39:45.149 --> 01:39:45.159 align:start position:0%
board had been collecting fees during
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
the time their rules were
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
expired um this particular memo um
 
01:39:54.189 --> 01:39:54.199 align:start position:0%
explains that the rule that actually has
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
the fees in it um which is uh RB
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
36.0 one um actually did not expire um
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
so those that rule that established what
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
fees are charged didn't expire it's
 
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
simply the renewal process and they
 
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
further argue that under the statute
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
they have the right to collect fines for
 
01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
renewals it's pretty clear that you know
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
a fee I should sorry I'll fine a fee fee
 
01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
to be collected so that was all for
 
01:40:27.239 --> 01:40:29.709 align:start position:0%
to be collected so that was all for
those

01:40:29.709 --> 01:40:29.719 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay but director moral uh one other
 
01:40:34.990 --> 01:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
quick thing yesterday we sent out a memo
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
to agencies summarizing the changes to
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
541a from the past session there were
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
four bills two of them were very minor
 
01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
and very specific HB 358 was the big one
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%

01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%

01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
copy of uh the memo the memo is very
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
long and very detailed it shows each
 
01:40:59.470 --> 01:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
section of the bill and then our
 
01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:02.599 align:start position:0%

01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
summary I'm good for one page yes would

yeah as will
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
I the long one is an attachment to the
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
email and the email itself has the
 
01:41:31.229 --> 01:41:31.239 align:start position:0%
summary okay that's fine we we can
 
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
ignore it once we we get
 
01:41:37.709 --> 01:41:37.719 align:start position:0%
it I didn't hear
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%

01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
motion on the remaining
 
01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
documents remain no the uh okay
 
01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
the preliminary objection responses have
 
01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
not yet been received so we're not going
 
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
to do anything with them
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
Madam chair are we going to cancel the
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
continued meeting I believe so we
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
haven't postponed anything to
 
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
