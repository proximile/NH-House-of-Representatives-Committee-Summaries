so

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
so i think chair maguire is another
 
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
meeting i think she's introducing
 
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
another bill uh she asked me to make an
 
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
announcement that
 
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
since at least two members and it looks
 
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
like more not going to be here we're not
 
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
house recognizes
 
00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
courtney executive director of plc
 
00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.430 align:start position:0%
courtney executive director of plc
um

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
i wish to thank representative mcguire
 
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill forward this is
 
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
essentially just a cleanup bill
 
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
as it currently stands electrology
 
00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 align:start position:0%
advisory committee is one of our four
 
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
advisory boards that makes
 
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the office regarding
 
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
licensure and regulation
 
00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
the statute currently requires that the
 
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
members of the three-person advisory
 
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
panel actually administer examinations
 
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
this is inconsistent with
 
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
the way
 
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
the majority of our other boards
 
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
administer exams and inconsistent with
 
00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 align:start position:0%
with how other states administer exams
 
00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 align:start position:0%
so we'd like to eliminate that
 
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
requirement so that we can actually
 
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
contract out for such services
 
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions is a
 
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
pretty basic bill
 
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
happy to answer anything any questions
 
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 align:start position:0%
i was actually trying to get um
 
00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.470 align:start position:0%
i was actually trying to get um
gourley

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
gourley
 
00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
goalie representative goalie
 
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
and then fellows
 
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
advisory uh committee okay with these
 
00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.550 align:start position:0%
advisory uh committee okay with these
changes

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee hasn't met for a
 
00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
long time so we haven't convened a
 
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 align:start position:0%
quorum and i don't know their position
 
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
we did meet several months ago to advise
 
00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
the rules with the understanding that we
 
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
would contract up for such
 
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.149 align:start position:0%
would contract up for such
services

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
their primary concern at the time even
 
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
though we didn't have a vote was who
 
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
would administer the practical
 
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
examinations and i told them that i
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
would research what other states are
 
00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 align:start position:0%
doing and get back to it
 
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
right now i have received one
 
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
resignation so we only have uh one
 
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
currently appointed i think to the
 
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
electrology advisory committee there are
 
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
only 60 licensees so that's part of the
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
reason behind these changes is to ensure
 
00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
you recognize for follow-up well i
 
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
understand there's only 60.
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
i want to be clear that
 
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to be
 
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
part of the advisory on to how the exams
 
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
are done and who's hired out and it's
 
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
not just under the oplc's decision to
 
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
determine who's the best for this is yes
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:03.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you know this or not but
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
um the committee's received emails in
 
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
the last day or two and they said that
 
00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 align:start position:0%
they were in the there were was a letter
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
from somebody who was on that advisory
 
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.430 align:start position:0%
from somebody who was on that advisory
board

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
and she said
 
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.070 align:start position:0%
and she said
that

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
they were not notified of this bill
 
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
and given your role to support boards
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me how that
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
came to be yep so all of our
 
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
i mean i can't speak to that
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
specifically all of our bill tracking
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
went out
 
00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 align:start position:0%
it should have gone out
 
00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:41.110 align:start position:0%
it should have gone out
this

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
it should be going out today because i i
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
input it all into the system and send it
 
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
out to all the board members or the
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
board administrators over the weekend
 
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
we had have conversations with them but
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
we have had difficulties convening a
 
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
quorum to have a meeting so um
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the fact that the board
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
members have declined to come in person
 
00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:00.710 align:start position:0%
members have declined to come in person
so

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
as you know i cannot i cannot
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
communicate with the board member via
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
email because that would constitute a
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
recognize for follow-up
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
so that raises two more questions in my
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
mind what why
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
why are the
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
no tracking information going out like
 
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
not yet so you're basically confirming
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
that you didn't notify them
 
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.870 align:start position:0%
that you didn't notify them
and

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.029 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
don't don't you have the opportunity to
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
hold to set up board meetings remotely
 
00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.070 align:start position:0%
hold to set up board meetings remotely
no

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
um it's a requirement of 91a that a
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
quorum be physically present in order to
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
conduct meetings
 
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.590 align:start position:0%
conduct meetings
and

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
that has been in a primary issue with
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
this board in that two out of the three
 
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.110 align:start position:0%
this board in that two out of the three
members

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
and i will say i've received resignation
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
so we do not currently have a full
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
electronic electoral electrology
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
advisory committee at present
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
but when it was fully staffed i could
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
not convene a quorum because they
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
chose not to come into the building in
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
person to conduct business
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
um regarding your your first question um
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
i agree it was late obviously we've had
 
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
staffing issues i just we just finally
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
hired a general counsel but at the same
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
time this advisory committee is we are
 
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
able to act without
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
i miss courtney i just want to make sure
 
00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:39.749 align:start position:0%
i miss courtney i just want to make sure
that

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
those people who are
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
seeking licenses in electrology
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
will be given an exam that they have a
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
competitive competency exam so that we
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
know that they're going to qualify to
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
practice in new hampshire
 
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.950 align:start position:0%
practice in new hampshire
yes

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
so that's been one of the concerns with
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
this hot current hodgepodge approach
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
with having board members administer
 
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.550 align:start position:0%
with having board members administer
exams

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
exams
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's not conducive to having a
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
timely licensure as you know under
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
541a29a we are required to
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
act within 60 days
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
given the current structure i'm not
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
confident that that could be
 
00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:17.029 align:start position:0%
confident that that could be
accomplished

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
accomplished
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's why i would like to contract
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
operate services much like other states
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
we actually already have a contract in
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
place that
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
with i think it's pearson vue who
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
administers our cosmetology exams in
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
accordance with the criteria established
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
by the board
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
and it includes electrology but we have
 
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919 align:start position:0%
not been able to utilize that contract
 
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
because of these statutory provisions so
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know i fully anticipate having a
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
contract established by requirements
 
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
based on advice of the electrology
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
committee but the individual could go
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
and contact
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
the exam service provider and staff you
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
know set up an exam time frame rather
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
than having to wait for a board member
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
recognize for follow-up yes thank you
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
so that anyone
 
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.790 align:start position:0%
so that anyone
new

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
to this coming to new hampshire will be
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
required to take this exam and i just
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the exam that the
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
new exam
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
at least the same standard as the old
 
00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:15.509 align:start position:0%
at least the same standard as the old
one

00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.030 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
i

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
have a question as to
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
it was my understanding when we first
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
set up oplc and there are some members
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
in this room that were around when this
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
happened and others who weren't familiar
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
with it at all that oplc was supposed to
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
be support to the boards and the boards
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
maintain their autonomy as to the
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
profession they regulated
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
my question is i thought i just heard
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
you state that you can go ahead and do
 
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
things without their consent and if
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's the case i have an issue with
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
that if you would believe it's i just
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
that wasn't the reason oplc was set up
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
in the original
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
setup and i think members in this room
 
00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:05.839 align:start position:0%
may be able to
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
either clarify or
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
if i may um
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
this profession is different because the
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
statute gives direct regulatory
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
authority to the executive director
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
there are four professions that do that
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's the body art
 
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.750 align:start position:0%
it's the body art
reflexology

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
reflexology
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
ophthalmic dispensers there's actually
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
no board and
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
a massage as well as
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
electrology the electrology advisory
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
committee has no independent regulatory
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
authority that's by the statute that's
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
very different from the other 50 boards
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
and i would agree with you
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative the other 50 boards our
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
job is to support the boards and their
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
independent regulatory
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority but the electrology
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
advisory committee has no independent
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority and that is the
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
distinction and that's why i made that
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
statement because it's the agency itself
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
that directly regulates electrologists
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.430 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
so

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh you just stated that the
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
the exam
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
qualification process that you envision
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
is not going to change
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to take a test and
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
yes representatives
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
you're correct so that's how we handle
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
it with cosmetology so if you can
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
imagine with all of the cosmetologists
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
that get licensed the board does not
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
administer exams we contract working
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
with the board we contract it's actually
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
with prometric
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
and they have uh staff who the person
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
can call and make an appointment they
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
hold exams every day they can go and
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
they can do the written exam at their
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
convenience and then they also have
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
practical examinations that are staffed
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
by cosmetologists estheticians
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
and they adhere to the requirements
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
established by the board and it can be
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
done in a faster manner and with a
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
contract in place they're held
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
accountable obviously so um we
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
anticipate a similar situation uh with
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
the electrologists that the licensee
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
could go in and do their written and you
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
know in front of a computer being
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
monitored at their convenience and then
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
the practical exam the same thing
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
they could go in and
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
hello uh i have
 
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere along your testimony
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
way back you said something you're not
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
permitted by law to do something that
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
just caught my ear what was that would
 
00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
you mind repeating what you're not
 
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
permitted to do by do you recall that
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
part of your testimony yes i do
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative it was to have remote
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
meetings per the states right to no law
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
rsa 91a a quorum of a regulatory body
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
must be physically present in order to
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
make decisions and convene a quorum
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
obviously that's been an issue with our
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
licensing boards as of late in that
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
you have anybody else have any further
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
questions representative fellows
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.190 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
you've told us that there are 60 people
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
who hold a license for electrology
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
are there are there people who
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
is that electrology ever combined with
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
any of the other
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
no so there's only 60 people in the
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
whole state who are qualified to
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
move remove hair
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
with the electrolysis process okay so so
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
how is it
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
you will be able to find
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
somebody to
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh give the practical exam
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and tell me about this
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
contracting place like what if somebody
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
lives up in littleton or are you going
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
to tell them they have to come all the
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
way down to manchester or how's that
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
going to work
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
um it's going to work how it works for
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
other professions and that you know
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
whatever contract and i don't i can't
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
say it would be prometric or
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
petersonview or whatnot but there are
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
companies that specialize in providing
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
exam services and they have locations
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
all over the place
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
so typically the person would have to go
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
to whatever the testing center is
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
closest to them and there would be
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
somebody qualified to administer the
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
exam you can appreciate that if i'm
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
having trouble getting people coming
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
into the building to administer a
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
practical that i have i have a realistic
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
concern that somebody
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
under the current structure um could
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
reach out to a board member who may not
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
be available within the 60-day time
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
frame and that is that's really the gist
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
any other members have any other
 
00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:53.509 align:start position:0%
any other members have any other
questions

00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you for your
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%

have written testimony would you like me
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
to provide that to you
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
certainly we can give it to the clerk
 
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.110 align:start position:0%
certainly we can give it to the clerk
okay

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
madam check one one more quick question
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
representative cool are you recognized
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
just a quick question on line 12 of the
 
00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:13.030 align:start position:0%
just a quick question on line 12 of the
bill

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:13.990 align:start position:0%
bill
sure

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
why are you striking the content and
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
conduct of written and practical exams
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
and just leaving it written in practical
 
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.910 align:start position:0%
and just leaving it written in practical
exams

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
hold on sorry i don't have it in front
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
of me
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
what was your question representative
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
line 12 yeah striking out the con
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
content and conduct of
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
why is that being removed because if
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
you're doing the looking at the exams it
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
should include those shouldn't it
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
the concern is that we're not present
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
they have a statutory requirement right
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
to provide input which means they have
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
to convene a quorum which which they
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
have not been doing um so without a
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
quorum we would not be able to make
 
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.350 align:start position:0%
quorum we would not be able to make
recommendations

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
or create an exam now if that were not
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
this the case statutorily we could
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
certainly receive input from one or two
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
members and provide that input into any
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
sort of requirement section but the fact
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
that we're currently required to convene
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
a quorum which is not happening because
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
they're not physically coming into the
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
building that puts us at um
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
we're not actually able we would not be
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
permitted to actually contract for those
 
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.030 align:start position:0%
permitted to actually contract for those
services

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
you recognize or follow mr
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
i'm looking under the rule making
 
00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:26.870 align:start position:0%
i'm looking under the rule making
authority

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.910 align:start position:0%
authority
on

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
chapter 314 and it says the exec
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
executive director shall adopt rules
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
pursuant to and then under it is roman
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
numeral 3 the content in conduct so
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's under your rule-making authority
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm just
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
don't understand why
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
content and conduct would be
 
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.430 align:start position:0%
content and conduct would be
removed

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
removed
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with the board it
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
has to do with the executive director's
 
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.230 align:start position:0%
has to do with the executive director's
authority

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
um actually i think those are board
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
requirements uh representative that they
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
actually be um
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
that they actually be physically present
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
in order to make decisions on the
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
conduct and the content of the
 
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.949 align:start position:0%
conduct and the content of the
examination

00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
examination
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
we're kind of at a standstill with some
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
of our licensing boards particularly
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
this one as well and that we can't make
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
any decisions because of the statutory
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
requirement that the
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
that particular board provide input on
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
on those issues and there and we're not
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
under 91a able to make any decisions
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
so that's what that was intended to
 
00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:28.309 align:start position:0%
so that's what that was intended to
address

00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
any other members have any other
 
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.310 align:start position:0%
any other members have any other
questions

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative schuett thank you not a
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%

folks in this profession who are a
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
little concerned about this
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
several of the bills that we had agreed
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
to make advisory
 
00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.270 align:start position:0%

are they also unable to perform
electrolysis

00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
electrolysis
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question i would have
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
to ask them um
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
they it's not that they can't meet it's
 
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
that they've declined to physically come
 
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
into the building
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
and that would be
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
my response to members of the board who
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
are concerned with this
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
is that if they actually would like to
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
regulate they need to come in and
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
regulate and do their job
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
and right now
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
we have not um
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
we had redrafted all of the electrology
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
rules i attempted to convene a quorum so
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
that we could get their input and i had
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
one person show up and didn't receive
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
any feedback
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
so that's where we're at right now which
 
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
i've got a non-functional board that
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
insists on retaining certain authority
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
but doesn't actually wish to carry out
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
the functions that they presently are
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
required to do so under statute so we
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
can't actually make any changes that are
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
beneficial to our constituents and our
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
licensees and actually protect the
 
00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:00.230 align:start position:0%
licensees and actually protect the
public

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative scitec did i just
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
understand that in that last minute you
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
really explained the whole situation
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
yes i tried to avoid that quite
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
diplomatically but at the end of the day
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you a question does occur um
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
miss courtney is it not true that um
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
the gentleman asked whether or not these
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
people are pursuing their professions
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
but would it not be true that when they
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
are pursuing their profession
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
they can sort of control the atmosphere
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
where they're working whereas if they
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
come into the building where they would
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
have to meet
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
with yours they cannot control the
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
situation i'm speaking about face masks
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
or cleanliness
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
sure yes we obviously as a stay per um
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
state requirement we cannot require
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
anybody to wear masks or face masks but
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
we have done everything that we can do
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
to accommodate boards that have concerns
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
our staff willingly done on face masks
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have these issues with the
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
board of medicine they're all providers
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have this issue with the board
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
of nursing they're all you know
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
clinicians as well
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
they all the majority of them wear masks
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
and our staff do too and we are happy as
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
always to find meeting space not in our
 
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.750 align:start position:0%
always to find meeting space not in our
building

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
if that's their preference
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
we had this issue come up with court
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
reporters recently we offered to meet in
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
the courtyard
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
that was declined so you know we can
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
only do so much i understand that people
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
feel uncomfortable but at the end of the
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
day government can't stop
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
further questions recognize for
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative schuett thank
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
you um
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
do you think that the effects of the
 
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.430 align:start position:0%
do you think that the effects of the
pandemic

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
had any effect on the ability to get
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
more board members to participate not
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
only this board but several of the
 
00:21:58.159 --> 00:21:59.350 align:start position:0%
only this board but several of the
others

00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
i think that's probably true i think
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
when we moved remote back in i think
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
april yes april 2020 we removed the
 
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.350 align:start position:0%
april yes april 2020 we removed the
boards

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
to remote meetings via the governor's
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
executive order
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
um at first
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
you can appreciate that nobody like you
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
know everybody has something to complain
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
about when we make decisions at oplc you
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
can't please 350 people but a lot of
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
them were not happy because they didn't
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
know how to use the technology and yada
 
00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:28.149 align:start position:0%
know how to use the technology and yada
yada

00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
yada
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
then i think they got used to it and the
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
fact that they didn't have to drive to
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
concord um it was very convenient
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
particularly for working professionals
 
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.630 align:start position:0%
particularly for working professionals
um

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
it is more convenient and then um
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
when obviously that executive order
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
ended that permitted them to uh have
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
remote meetings in may of 2021 again
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
everybody complained
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
um i think that it's been difficult for
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
retention both in the fact that uh you
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
know it's hard to
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
get working professionals to take a
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
whole day off to drive down to concord
 
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
um as well as the fact that some people
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
obviously rightfully so may
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
remain concerned about exposure
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
and but yeah yeah i certainly think that
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
that has helped i mean the good thing is
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
that they've they've embraced a
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
different technology that i don't think
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
they would have
 
00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.830 align:start position:0%
they would have
thank

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
you representative grota
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you i would like to make a note to
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
the committee first that you need to
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
speak directly into your microphone
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
and i know it sounds loud but people who
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
are listening to the youtube video
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
cannot hear us if we talk like this
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
my question to miss courtney is if the
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
board is not
 
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.269 align:start position:0%
board is not
um

00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
if they're having a bad day
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
can those board members be replaced
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
certainly they can be replaced um
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
presently the statute it's a little
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
unclear as to because
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
i appointed these board members they're
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
not governor and council appointments
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
one of our issues just generally just to
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
throw it out there is once a board
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
member's on you can't get them off
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
unless they're impeached even if they
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
don't show up which is which is a huge
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
problem um and as you know an
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
impeachment is unlikely to occur
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
the uh with these advisory board members
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
it's not actually clear what authority i
 
00:24:22.159 --> 00:24:23.190 align:start position:0%
it's not actually clear what authority i
have

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.070 align:start position:0%
have
to

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
either force a resignation or to
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
remove them
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
my gut tells me there would need to be
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
some sort of a hearing because there was
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
an appointment um in place
 
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.029 align:start position:0%
an appointment um in place
so

00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
unless we typically ask for resignations
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
um but i have had people who i just had
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
somebody on a different committee hasn't
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
shown up in a year has i've
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
sent her certified letters
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
we filed a complaint against
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
somebody for not showing up because she
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%

just a friendly reminder when you're
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
tested when you're asking a question if

you could please speak directly into
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
your microphone the audio appears to be
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
a little bit sketchy today and people
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
are having trouble hearing online
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
are there any other members from the
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
public that wish to testify for house
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'll close the hearing on
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 1062. oh my god i didn't even
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
see you representative schmidt i was
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
looking but
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
my nickname in the marine corps used to
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
be superman
 
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.590 align:start position:0%
be superman
but

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
i was never known as the invisible man
 
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.830 align:start position:0%
i was never known as the invisible man
before

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
in any case uh i'm
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
seeing that representative maguire was
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
unable to be with us this morning as a
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
but i'm on the bill so i
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
didn't feel comfortable um
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
asking questions from the bench so to
 
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.950 align:start position:0%
asking questions from the bench so to
speak

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
i i in it's important for the committee
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
members to understand that one of the
 
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
things that we're doing
 
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.310 align:start position:0%
things that we're doing
is

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
is we are attempting to assist the
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
executive director in
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
reorganizing the way
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
oplc functions a number of the senior
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
recognized that
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
there are certain deficiencies that were
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
kind of built into oplc at the time it
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
was constructed
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
which have served as an impediment
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
good order and discipline if you will of
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
oplc and the functionality and so we are
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
starting on
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
a small group of
 
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.390 align:start position:0%
a small group of
boards

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the bills
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
will be coming up shortly
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
and we are attempting to get more
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
functionality by having
 
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.190 align:start position:0%
functionality by having
the

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.269 align:start position:0%
the
oplc

00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
more thoroughly
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
handling the
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
administration aspects
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
this was referenced before by
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
representative goldie
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
but also to have the
 
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.070 align:start position:0%
but also to have the
the

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
members of the profession
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
concentrate more and be more restricted
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
dealing only with the
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
the profession itself
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
rather than the administration of the
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
profession because in many cases we have
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
discovered that
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
the board members frequently may not be
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
aware of all the legal requirements such
 
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.669 align:start position:0%
aware of all the legal requirements such
as

00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:28:05.679 --> 00:28:08.149 align:start position:0%
as
1991a

00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
1991a
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
and other requirements of
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
a procedure
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
and which would be better handled by
 
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.549 align:start position:0%
and which would be better handled by
the

00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:17.830 align:start position:0%
the
oplc

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
and as you see in this particular
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
instance and i'm hoping representative
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
mcguire will
 
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
supplement this now that she's arrived
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
but that
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
the some of the senior members of edna
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
are on this bill so rehearsal mcguire
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
representative schuett myself
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
and in some cases it's representative
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
goldie as well
 
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.149 align:start position:0%
goldie as well
so

00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
i do notice that one of the language and
 
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.669 align:start position:0%
i do notice that one of the language and
i'm

00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
glad that the director courtney's still
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
here because as you noticed if you look
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
line 10
 
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
it says
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
continuing life
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
the following the thought of
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
line three the executive
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
executive director shall establish and
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
so forth and then says in line 10 advise
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
the executive director regarding
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
implementation of this chapter and i'm
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
glad to hear that under this proposed
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
language the executive director would be
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
in direct contact with the executive
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
director uh that would be a presumption
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
on my part that we wouldn't want to have
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
three faces of eve uh and all kind of uh
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
getting involved here
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
so we might want to change that language
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.470 align:start position:0%
a little bit
but

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
so if anyone has any questions uh i i
 
00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:38.870 align:start position:0%
so if anyone has any questions uh i i
would

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
hope they would defer
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
until representative mcguire can give
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt does
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for the
 
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.950 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for the
representative

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm carol maguire
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
representing merrimack district 29 the
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
towns of allenstown epsom and pittsfield
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
i sponsored house bill 1062
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
at the request of the oplc
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
it is intended to have the oplc
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
provide all the administrative
 
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.710 align:start position:0%
provide all the administrative
and

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.590 align:start position:0%
and
non-technical

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
non-technical
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
duties of the board and allow the board
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
to concentrate on the job specific
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
issues that require knowledge of the of
 
00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:41.830 align:start position:0%
issues that require knowledge of the of
the

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
of the profession and that's
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
there are three
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
so that's uh it makes it an advisory
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
committee rather than a regulatory board
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's all it is
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%

00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
our next bill isn't until 10 45 so we
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%

minutes

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering i would like to schedule
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
1535 the cola bill
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
as soon as we possibly can the earliest
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
i think i can do is friday and i want i
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
already asked representative goalie i'm
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
hoping if we can get a location
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
to do it to have
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
at least the first round
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
it may take more than one
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.350 align:start position:0%
 
friday

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
friday
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
i heard friday afternoon now
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative gola you said you're
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
i want as many people here as i can
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
this is this is an important bill i
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
i had said to representative goalie and
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
i'll repeat it um
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
we can vote it up or down but i don't
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
want to i don't want it either way
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to i will not be happy to
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
win and not be happy to lose
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
i think this this needs some work i
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
think something can be done
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
and that's why i want representative
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
goalie i'm looking for representatives
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
schmidt they're the heavy hitters and i
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
think we should have their input whether
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%

unable to be with us
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%

close encounter with the
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
omicron virus

so anyway i'm pleased
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
to open house bill 1065
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the regulation of art
 
00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.589 align:start position:0%
relative to the regulation of art
therapists

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
therapists
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
deals with a subject matter that we have
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
in edna several times in the past
 
00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.990 align:start position:0%

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure we'll explore it in the
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
course of
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
the thing and maybe i just better
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%

yourselves
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
um because
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
this is a very useful
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
therapy that uh
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
that is beneficial
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
i have a constituent in in dover
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
who operates uh so-called sanotina
 
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.470 align:start position:0%

center

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh in dover and she says that
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
she has a very strong
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
public demand for these services at the
 
00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.710 align:start position:0%
public demand for these services at the
moment

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
and uh so we'll get into the details
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
later on but i urge you to um
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
look carefully at representing dr
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
britton testimony and thank you very
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%

00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
as i'm done
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt could
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%

00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%

sure i'll give it a try representative
blackis

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
blackis
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you you mentioned someone else
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
speaking later so maybe this would be to
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
someone else but i don't i don't see who
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
it would be so my question is um
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know the art therapists are
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
currently um licensed in some way and
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
this would put them under um
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
under the uh the mental health
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
board no they are not licensed they have
 
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.510 align:start position:0%
board no they are not licensed they have
their

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
title protected
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
we have defined what an art therapist is
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
and we restrict who can call themselves
 
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
an art therapist ah thank you that
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
answers my question yeah is that the
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
chair is quite correct that we did
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
provide that protection for them in one
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
of the early go rounds
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
one of the problems is because they are
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
not licensed in many cases they are not
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh able to be
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
covered by insurance
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
because the insurance companies require
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
people to be licensed they're fully
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
accredited and they this is a
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
substantial enterprise nationally it's
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
just that without the licensing they've
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
got that
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
can't get there from here phenomenon
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this is
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
representative bellows i just wanted to
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
um say
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
a few things for the people who haven't
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
who are just new
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
this term because we had this bill
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
um we had this bill last
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
session last term
 
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.750 align:start position:0%
session last term
and

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.309 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
prior to that
 
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:18.790 align:start position:0%
prior to that
the

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
bill passed in 2018 and the in the one
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
that protected the title
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
that particular part of the statute
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
what it does is it says nobody can call
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
themselves an art therapist unless they
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
have met a whole list of qualifications
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
including at least
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
i think they need a master's degree so
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
you could look at that
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
last term
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
we had this bill it passed this
 
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.030 align:start position:0%
we had this bill it passed this
committee

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
it passed the house
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
and due to covid it never got a hearing
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the reasons it's come
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's coming up again
 
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:03.990 align:start position:0%
it's coming up again
so

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
that's just those are just a couple of
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
points i just wanted to share for the
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
people who
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
is there uh represent
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
director uh
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't think i trust you're going to
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes i can't stay
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
silent i guess on a licensure bill
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
lindsey courtney executive director oplc
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
oplc doesn't take a position on whether
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
licensure is needed for art therapists
 
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.910 align:start position:0%
licensure is needed for art therapists
although

00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
although
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
i do want to throw out there that we've
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
had um
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
we've we've increased the number of
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
licenses over the last couple years
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
primarily for reimbursement
 
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
and i think at some point we probably as
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
a state need to resolve the issue we
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
from my perspective
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
licensing individuals that don't
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to be licensed just so
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
that they can receive reimbursement i
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what the solution is because
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
i know that involves insurance and
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's outside my wheelhouse but
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
licensure really isn't intended to
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
protect the public not to provide a
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism for reimbursement but i
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
understand it's a concern and
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
maybe this is the short-term fix so we
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
don't take a position the only thing
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to note was that on page 2
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
line 21 regarding fees
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
purports to
 
00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.670 align:start position:0%
purports to
transfer

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
fee setting authority back to the board
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
the committee may be aware that there's
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
been an ongoing
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
issue with fee setting authority and
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
that in 2018
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
the authority of the boards to establish
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
fees was transferred to the office
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
but the language was retained in the
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
statute of the practice acts so we have
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
um we've been at a bit of a standstill
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of fee setting authority and
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
and we have a bill in place this year
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
that i think would clean that up and we
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
would just have concerns
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
of fee setting authority being
 
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
transferred back to the boards only
 
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.910 align:start position:0%
transferred back to the boards only
because

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
we're not able to actually
 
00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.750 align:start position:0%
we're not able to actually
provide

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
a proportionate allocation of shared
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
costs when the office itself is not able
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
to set all of the fees for all the
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
boards um it impacts uh
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
allocations and it could impact you know
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that some boards could be over
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
125 some could be well under 100
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
so those are the only comments and i'd
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know be happy to work with anybody
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
to revise that if that was
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
if the committee was so inclined happy
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
i i just have a question about the fee
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
that you were just talking about so to
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
address your concern wouldn't you
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
want to amend
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
make a bigger i mean taking art
 
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.109 align:start position:0%
make a bigger i mean taking art
therapist

00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
out of here wouldn't solve your problem
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
that you were describing correct you
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
want to do that for all the boards
 
00:56:04.559 --> 00:56:06.150 align:start position:0%
want to do that for all the boards
so

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
correct that actually
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
in 2000 i think it was 2018 um
 
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:13.829 align:start position:0%
in 2000 i think it was 2018 um
the

00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
legislature passed language that
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
transferred all of the board's fee
 
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
setting authority to the office
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
but when they did that they didn't
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
remove the language from the board
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
practice act that says you know the
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
board shall establish fees
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
so technically legally as the practice
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
acts have been amended we incorporated
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
that language after 2018 the boards
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
actually have the authority and not the
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
office this has been an issue at jail
 
00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.510 align:start position:0%
office this has been an issue at jail
car

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
car
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
and actually jail car
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
voted on a declaration to
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
confirm essentially that oplc has the
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
fee setting authority
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
but we're presently trying to clean up
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
the statutory language to remove
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
language that says the board shall
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
establish fees for all of the practice
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
acts just to make clear that the office
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
can establish fees
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
because right now we have several boards
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
that are paying way more than 125
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
percent we have some boards that aren't
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
meeting costs um
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
and obviously that's concerning if
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
they're paying more than 125 that's an
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional tax and we'd like to
 
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
resolve that problem but without the
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
ability to adopt fees across the board
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
for all boards at the same time using
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
the same allocation method uh we're not
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
able to do that so on an amendment i
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
would just remove reference to the board
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
chow and i would say you know the office
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
shell because that's that's the
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
authority that was granted to the office
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
in 310a
 
00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.190 align:start position:0%
in 310a
yes

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass this we would want to
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
make an amendment to delete the comment
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
about the boards
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
the fee set by the board they do have to
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
pay the fee but it's not set by the
 
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:49.990 align:start position:0%
pay the fee but it's not set by the
board

all right
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
anyone else need to testify
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%

public hearing
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
and our next hearing starts at 10 30.
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
excuse me 11 30 my mistake um so we have
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
a bit of i was expecting this to take
 
00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.230 align:start position:0%
a bit of i was expecting this to take
longer

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
longer
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
but but the with the sponsor not here
 
00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.549 align:start position:0%
but but the with the sponsor not here
it's

00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.079 --> 00:58:37.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
we'll not be voting on any bills today
 
00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.069 align:start position:0%
we'll not be voting on any bills today
because

00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
it being 11 30 i'm going to call to
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm going to go to order house
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill 1192
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm still carol mcguire
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
representing merrimack district 29
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
which is the towns of allenstown epsom
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
and pittsfield
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
and house bill 1192 is primarily a
 
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
repeat of a bill
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
20

01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
in 1920 that died in the senate it
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
passed this committee it passed the
 
01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:05.750 align:start position:0%
passed this committee it passed the
house

01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
and it died in the senate so we're
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
repeating it
 
01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.470 align:start position:0%
repeating it
um

01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:14.709 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
various

01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
various
 
01:32:20.159 --> 01:32:21.350 align:start position:0%
various
sections

01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
sections
 
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
it allows a person who's a doctor or
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
acupuncture to call themselves that
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
and it eliminates the requirements for
 
01:32:29.199 --> 01:32:31.830 align:start position:0%
and it eliminates the requirements for
nccaom

01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
nccaom
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
certification and training because
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
only one of multiple
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
very narrowly specialized there are
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
different types of acupuncture that they
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
can people can learn other
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
so it adds
 
01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:03.830 align:start position:0%
so it adds
light

01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
light
 
01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.430 align:start position:0%

the qualifications whatever
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
and what else
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
number of different changes recommended
 
01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
and it's on page 2 line 17 it it
 
01:33:49.110 --> 01:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
specifically adds
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
a internship program which is how most
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
people learn acupuncture in the first
 
01:33:54.239 --> 01:33:55.270 align:start position:0%

place
so

01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
as long as you have a balanced
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%

basically it's for it's for sanitary
reasons

01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:02.629 align:start position:0%
reasons
but

01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
i also have a letter from
 
01:35:05.119 --> 01:35:06.229 align:start position:0%
i also have a letter from
the

01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
board of
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire acupuncture and asian
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
medicine association which is in support
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
except they don't think
 
01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
a physician would be appropriate
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
in section six
 
01:35:20.159 --> 01:35:21.350 align:start position:0%
in section six
so

01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:23.590 --> 01:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
we can take that into advisement i'd
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
like to have this entered into the into
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
the record i will try to answer
 
01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:31.189 align:start position:0%
the record i will try to answer
questions

01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative lekis
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
on section six you're just speaking
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
about it just adds as i read it as a
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
physician or osteopath
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
to the people to the acupuncturist who
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
could do the site visit right is that
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct so they're
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
objecting to uh to allowing the
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
physician or osteopath rather than an
 
01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:55.390 align:start position:0%
physician or osteopath rather than an
acupuncturist

01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist
 
01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:58.470 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist
[Music]

01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
they say that such oversight goes beyond
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
the needs of acupuncture practitioners
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
and patients
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
but i think that the point of it is that
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
if you can't get an acupuncturist to
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
check that you're
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
using sterile you know proper
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
cleanliness and sanitation issues
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
a doctor or actually probably a
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
nurse would be just as good
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
you representative schuett
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
um representative do you have an inkling
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
as to
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
why the previous bill died in the senate
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
was it just due to the pandemic or were
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
there issues raised i didn't hear of any
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
issues it never got a hearing it just
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
went away so likely because of the
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
if if i may inquire about a question i'm
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
and i apologize if i should know this
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
where it says three
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
has completed a valid internship program
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
three years minimum
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
is that also a certain amount of hours
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
not necessarily some some
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes we give a number of hours
 
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes we give it you know months or
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
years it depends on the profession
 
01:37:16.719 --> 01:37:19.109 align:start position:0%
years it depends on the profession
but

01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's up to them if they think years is
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
the appropriate measure that's fine
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
the electricians like ours because they
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
like to work overtime and
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
cut the number of months and years down
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
i don't have any issues with the intent
 
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
but when i start to read
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
um section
 
01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:46.870 align:start position:0%
um section
four

01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
i get confused
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
with it with that like ands and the oars
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
and just that kind of logic because it
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
starts out on line 26
 
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
that will issue a license to an
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
applicant who satisfies all
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
of the requirements yes you have to
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
follow the
 
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.790 align:start position:0%
follow the
logic

01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
logic
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
in this case they have to be 21 which i
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
personally would be willing to eliminate
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
and then they have to do b which is
 
01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.669 align:start position:0%
and then they have to do b which is
certification

01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.679 --> 01:38:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
d

01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:33.189 align:start position:0%
 
or

01:38:33.189 --> 01:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
they have the
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
of age certification
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
has earned a baccalaureate or as a nurse
 
01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:45.189 align:start position:0%
has earned a baccalaureate or as a nurse
or

01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:38:45.199 --> 01:38:46.390 align:start position:0%
or
so

01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh a is age
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
b is certification
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
and c is
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
c paid the fee very important
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
and d has earned a
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
this is education
 
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
so it's either
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
or has successfully completed
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
post-secondary acupuncture college
 
01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:13.990 align:start position:0%
post-secondary acupuncture college
program

01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
approved by the board or has a valid
 
01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.310 align:start position:0%
approved by the board or has a valid
internship

01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
internship
 
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
i'm still getting confused
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
because d is
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
baccalaureate and and has a current
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
balance license from another state
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
right so they have a baccalaureate or
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
are a nurse or physician assistant
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
with a valid license to practice
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
acupuncture or have taken
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
post-secondary acupuncture college
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
program board approved
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
or has a valid internship program
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
so there are
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
and i agree it's not the cleanest way to
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
put it i would probably have put
 
01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:04.390 align:start position:0%
put it i would probably have put
the

01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
acupuncture college program
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
first then the
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
education in other areas that also has
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
an acupuncture license from another
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
state or has the internship
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
but so just like one tiny question so on
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
on the first page
 
01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:24.950 align:start position:0%
on the first page
b

01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
b
 
01:40:27.590 --> 01:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
that certification
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
they can get that certification or or
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
or a different certification approved by
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
the board so everybody has to do that
 
01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:42.149 align:start position:0%
the board so everybody has to do that
correct

01:40:42.149 --> 01:40:42.159 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they're they have
 
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.030 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they're they have
a

01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
baccalaureate degree or those other
 
01:40:47.679 --> 01:40:49.109 align:start position:0%
baccalaureate degree or those other
okay

01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
yes so it's age
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
certification and education
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
and of course paying the fee okay
 
01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:58.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
representative lakis
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
thinking back on some earlier discussion
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
today should the dollar amount of the
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
license fee be in here or should it be
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
set by the
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
executor of oplc i believe executive
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for catching that
 
01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:15.350 align:start position:0%
thank you for catching that
and

01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
i will
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
i i agree we should be
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
we should be having that be
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
rewarded if we make any changes at all
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
any other members have any other
 
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.910 align:start position:0%
any other members have any other
questions

01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire this does not
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
expand authority or change scope of
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
practice or anything like this is
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
basically an enhanced
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh house clean housekeeping well that
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
does clarify
 
01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
the ways that one can show one's
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
competence in
 
01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:54.229 align:start position:0%
competence in
acupuncture

01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
acupuncture
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't change the scope of
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
any other members have any other
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you for your
 
01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:13.430 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you for your
testimony

01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
are there any other members from the
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
by any chance do you have a pink card
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
you you may
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
give your testimony and then when you're
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
finished if you could please fill out
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
if you could push push thank you very
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
much thank you for taking my testimony
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
i'm elizabeth rob i'm a licensed
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist and i'm here in support of
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
hb 1192 and i want to thank chairwoman
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
mcguire and representative schmidt for
 
01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
being sponsors
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
this bill seems to reflect a national
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
trend of removing obstacles for
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
professional licensure which
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:43:09.669 --> 01:43:09.679 align:start position:0%
puts term limits on licensing board
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
members which we should have just like
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
any other licensing board
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
and also one of my main concerns is
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
removing the requirement that
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists must maintain active
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
status with the national certification
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
commission of acupuncture and oriental
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
medicine taking the test is one thing or
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
an equivalent but we shouldn't have to
 
01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
be required to continuously pay for the
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
active status
 
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
last summer i spoke to the federal trade
 
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
commission about the anti-competitive
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
practices of the ncc aom and many other
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists have done the same
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
i brought some of the financials for ncc
 
01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:47.750 align:start position:0%
i brought some of the financials for ncc
aom

01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
aom
 
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
in 2019 their chief operating officer
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
finally retired cory ward cook her
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
outgoing salary was a quarter of a
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
they maintain an office on k street
 
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
they're a certification commission but
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
they also have a lobbyist they lobby for
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
policies that benefit their own
 
01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
certification organization
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
not licensed acupuncturists as a
 
01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:09.590 align:start position:0%
not licensed acupuncturists as a
profession

01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
profession
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
their tests are very expensive
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
it costs four hundred dollars to apply
 
01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:15.679 align:start position:0%
to take the test it's nine hundred
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
dollars to take all the tests and then
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's an additional five 500 to just pay
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
for like your first four years of
 
01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
active certification which you maintain
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
with continuing education credits that
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
they approve
 
01:44:29.199 --> 01:44:31.430 align:start position:0%
they approve
um

01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:32.550 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
so i was initially licensed in the state
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
of north carolina so i needed the test
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
but i didn't need to pay for the active
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
status in north carolina and i paid for
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
it anyway because the ncc aom promotes
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
their certification as a passport to
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
get licensure in other states and that's
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
not true i couldn't just take my
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
acupuncture school transcripts and then
 
01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:55.270 align:start position:0%
acupuncture school transcripts and then
my

01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
national certification with ncc aom and
 
01:44:59.590 --> 01:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
get a new hampshire license i wasn't
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
granted reciprocity here i had to start
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
from scratch and fill out an entire
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
application and i met
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
all the criteria
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
a license to practice acupuncture in the
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire so
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
what this bill intends to do is to make
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
i'll just say i support apprenticeships
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
for acupuncture
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships are making a comeback in
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
a wide variety of professions especially
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
in the health field behavioral health
 
01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:32.390 align:start position:0%
in the health field behavioral health
field

01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
field
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
students come out of acupuncture school
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
with a hundred and fifty thousand to two
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty thousand dollars in
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
debt yeah yes they do with very very few
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
job prospects
 
01:45:42.159 --> 01:45:42.950 align:start position:0%
job prospects
um

01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
and we need to think about future
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
generations of acupuncturists that's why
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
we really need to reinstate the
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
acupuncture apprenticeship route
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm just going to add two more
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
points um
 
01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
in our statute currently we have the
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
accreditation commission of acupuncture
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
and oriental medicine mentioned by name
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
they are the accreditation commission
 
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.350 align:start position:0%
they are the accreditation commission
that

01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
accredits our acupuncture schools and
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
last fall they changed their name to the
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
accreditation commission of acupuncture
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
and herbal medicine so lawmakers around
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
the country are now just going back and
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
just making that name change in their
 
01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:18.310 align:start position:0%
just making that name change in their
laws

01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
laws
 
01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.109 align:start position:0%
laws
and

01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
my last point is about supervision for
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
acupuncture detoxification specialists
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
you think i should take my mask off
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:30.310 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
okay

01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
so does everyone know what an
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
acupuncture detoxification specialist is
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
okay um some members of this committee
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
are very familiar with it so i'm a
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
licensed acupuncturist i went to school
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
for four years i can needle points all
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
over the body but in new hampshire and
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
roughly half of other states in this
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
country we have another certification an
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
acupuncture detoxification specialist
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
takes a shorter course of training
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
they're trained in five acupuncture
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
points in the outer ear by the national
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
acupuncture detoxification association
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
or equivalent training and
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
that treatment is a support for
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder behavioral health
 
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
mental health stress anxiety trauma
 
01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:14.629 align:start position:0%
mental health stress anxiety trauma
and

01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
so what i would say in terms of
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
supervision is i support widening who
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
can supervise to doctors and osteopaths
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm one of two licensed acupuncturists
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire who has taken the nada
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
training that makes us eligible to
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
provide general supervision for
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
the adss
 
01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:31.830 align:start position:0%
the adss
and

01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
there are very few acupuncturists in new
 
01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire who've taken the nada training
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's what they need to have in order
 
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
to provide general supervision
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
so yes i support widening who who can
 
01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:43.910 align:start position:0%
so yes i support widening who who can
supervise

01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
supervise
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
i i would add that supervision is most
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
important in the first year any year
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
after that the adss know what they're
 
01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:51.350 align:start position:0%
after that the adss know what they're
doing

01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
um it just seems like a redundant let me
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
back up in 2017 that's when the ads law
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
was passed and acupuncturists pushed for
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
more supervision requirements than what
 
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
we have now and they did it because they
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
thought it would give them jobs which it
 
01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:06.470 align:start position:0%
thought it would give them jobs which it
doesn't

01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
we supervise as volunteers because no
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
one's making money practicing ear
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
acupuncture it doesn't earn them more
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
money at their jobs in programs or in
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
their private practices as behavioral
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
health specialists
 
01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:19.109 align:start position:0%
health specialists
and

01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
they wanted more supervision over ads
 
01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
because they thought it would be a form
 
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
of control
 
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
and i supervise as a volunteer because
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get services to people
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
we've had an opioid epidemic for a long
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
time in the state of new hampshire i was
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
providing trying to provide another
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
resource for people and we have a
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
behavioral health epidemic i mean half
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
the people who are going to the
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals in new hampshire right now are
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
seeking behavioral health treatment
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:48:46.709 --> 01:48:46.719 align:start position:0%
you know i support you know lightening
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
up on the supervision for the ads's
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
they're competently trained and after
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
the first year they know what they're
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
doing so does anyone have any questions
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%

should ncc aom gives the certification
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
exam for acupuncturists
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
acom yes a-c-a-o-m correct they changed
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
their name but it is a-c-a-o-m that sort
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
of it says here uh who has earned a
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
doctoral degree in the practice of
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
acupuncture from an a-c-a-o-m
 
01:49:37.589 --> 01:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
or border-proof program so that's
 
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
correct correct and their new name as of
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
the fall is the acupuncture this is the
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
accreditation commission of acupuncture
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
and herbal medicine so would that
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
acronym change
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
that acronym would change and what would
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
follow up if i could
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
what would the new acronym be it would
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
be the a c a hm
 
01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:56.070 align:start position:0%
be the a c a hm
c

01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
c
 
01:49:58.709 --> 01:49:58.719 align:start position:0%
a h m
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
does any other members have any
 
01:50:08.149 --> 01:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative bailey just just along
 
01:50:14.589 --> 01:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
those lines would the ncc aom become the
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
ncca hm no they're separate
 
01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:19.270 align:start position:0%
ncca hm no they're separate
organizations

01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to send up a pink card
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
correct um i'm going to do that now okay
 
01:50:33.589 --> 01:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
thank you are you on the board i'm not
 
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
see no further questions you thank you
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
so i have letters um who should i give
 
01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:51.679 align:start position:0%
these to
 
01:50:51.679 --> 01:50:52.709 align:start position:0%
these to
you

01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
are there any other members from the
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
i've been waiting so long to be here for
 
01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:24.790 align:start position:0%
i've been waiting so long to be here for
this

01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
so this is thrilling
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
um i want to point out the word oriental
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
is considered a slur so probably the ncc
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
aom will change its name shortly it's
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
being taken out of all laws it appears
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
in our rules i have suggested to the
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
board they removed that but they have
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
not removed it yet
 
01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:43.830 align:start position:0%
not removed it yet
that's

01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:51:46.629 --> 01:51:46.639 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so my name is laura cooley i
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
live in orford new hampshire i'm a
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
licensed acupuncturist i'm a registered
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
not a trainer that's the national
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
acupuncture detoxification association
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
i'm the person who trains the acute
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
detox specialist that me and elizabeth
 
01:51:58.719 --> 01:52:00.830 align:start position:0%
detox specialist that me and elizabeth
supervise

01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
supervise
 
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
um and i'm an advocate for legislature
 
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
that improves
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
restrictions that are not helpful to the
 
01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:09.669 align:start position:0%
restrictions that are not helpful to the
public

01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
um into practice which have only
 
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
increased over the 30 years i've been an
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist so the first thing that
 
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses is term limits the
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
board members have no term limits and
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
some members served for 20 years so
 
01:52:25.199 --> 01:52:26.390 align:start position:0%
some members served for 20 years so
that's

01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
this hb 1192 it imposes term limits
 
01:52:32.229 --> 01:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
and coming that comes into line with all
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
the other oplc boards when i ask the
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
lawyer for the state there's no other
 
01:52:38.070 --> 01:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
board that doesn't have term limits
 
01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:39.510 align:start position:0%
board that doesn't have term limits
um

01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
our current law says you have to have a
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
current active certification by nccum
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
there are they are both our board
 
01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
testing agency and a trade organization
 
01:52:52.629 --> 01:52:52.639 align:start position:0%
that lobbies to create higher standards
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
at this point nccm is the sole route of
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
licensure and what i just heard i'm a
 
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
little confused because we were asking
 
01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
to strike that as the sole route to
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
licensure to add apprenticeship but the
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
discussion that i just heard sounds like
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
you're requiring an apprenticeship to
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
also be certified by one of those
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
three options
 
01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:18.070 align:start position:0%
three options
and

01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's the nccm does not accept them
 
01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:22.310 align:start position:0%
that's the nccm does not accept them
anymore

01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:24.229 align:start position:0%
anymore
so

01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to get an
 
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
nccm certification and at this moment
 
01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
there is no other certification there is
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
a california test they would not be able
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
to take that certification either so if
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
we don't remove that requirement we are
 
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
going to be we're not going to make any
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
progress here on this
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
um the nccm it tests just one style of
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
asian medicine there are many other
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
styles like korean there's a korean
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
college in pennsylvania they are not
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
able to practice in new hampshire unless
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
they learn the traditional chinese style
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
that this tests for there are many
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
different styles every country it goes
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
to they develop a different style people
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
from other countries cannot practice in
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire unless they take that
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
national test and you know that's a
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
three-year school to learn that style
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
um current nccm certification it's
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
required to to renew my license by rule
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
so in addition to licensing fees we got
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
to pay them dues as well so we are
 
01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
double taxed essentially for our
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
licenses in new hampshire i don't
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
believe that is
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
that is um how it should be
 
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
mds they take their national boards they
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't pay them for the rest of their
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
life to have a license in a state
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
so hb 11 1992 it strikes that
 
01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:41.430 align:start position:0%
so hb 11 1992 it strikes that
requirement

01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
no one will be damaged by this it just
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
takes money out of our pocketbooks
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
and it makes new hampshire a much more
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
attractive place for acupuncturists to
 
01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
move because we do know of acupunctures
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
that will not move to a new hampshire
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
right now because of how difficult our
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
law is
 
01:54:56.550 --> 01:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to apprenticeship i
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
became an acupuncturist through
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship i sat for the national
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
exam i passed the exam it's the
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
traditional way you you
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
learn acupuncture in many asian
 
01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:08.390 align:start position:0%
learn acupuncture in many asian
countries

01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
countries
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
but the nccm it removed apprenticeship
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
as a route
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
to licensure
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
you can't sit for the exam anymore and
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
this blocks you from licensure in new
 
01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire and many other states
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
so it's another reason i object to
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
paying those fees because that's how i
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
got here and they have eliminated that
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's various levels of acupuncture
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
training around the world in every every
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
culture there are ear acupuncture and
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
and more um
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
discrete services right discrete kind of
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
ways to treat with people with
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
acupuncture that does not require a
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
three-year education
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
when i contacted the nccm about why they
 
01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
eliminated apprenticeships i asked them
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
for their board meeting minutes and they
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
said no we won't give them to you and
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
they gave me a link to their
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
board policy guide which says if you
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
have disgruntled memberships do not
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
provide transparency so
 
01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
you can't get their meeting minutes they
 
01:56:10.870 --> 01:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
won't give them to you when i asked them
 
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
why they did it they said the states
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
eliminated it themselves
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
and so that means that if i want to
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
change this policy i'm going to have to
 
01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
go to all the states convince them to
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
reinstate apprenticeships and then
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
convince the nccm to do that
 
01:56:25.599 --> 01:56:26.629 align:start position:0%
convince the nccm to do that
so

01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
i find that a little burdensome
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
and i really hope that you consider
 
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
reversing this course
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
and you have put an apprenticeship
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm really grateful for that
 
01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:51.669 align:start position:0%
so i'm really grateful for that
um

01:56:51.669 --> 01:56:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
so another issue is if i could back up a
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
little our law actually gives the
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
acupuncture board the authority to set
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
standards for education
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
licensing boards are typically charged
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
with protecting the public
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
i don't believe this is usual practice
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
the medical board does not tell a
 
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
surgeon what college he needs to
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
graduate from and he does not tell him
 
01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:16.639 align:start position:0%
what training they need to take in order
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
to do brain surgery
 
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.390 align:start position:0%
to do brain surgery
right

01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
they take their the educational
 
01:57:24.070 --> 01:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
standards are set by the accreditation
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
institutions they take board exams and
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
they passed
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
right that's why they practice medicine
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire adopted the nccm
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
requirements for ceus
 
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to keep you up in the
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
field protect the public so for my
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
required ceus last year i took a course
 
01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
from their website a class called
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
introduction to astrology for the tcm
 
01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:47.030 align:start position:0%
introduction to astrology for the tcm
clinician

01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
clinician
 
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
i failed to see how this protects the
 
01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:51.189 align:start position:0%
i failed to see how this protects the
public

01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh in that class i learned that there
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
are wounds that can never ever be healed
 
01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
and that patients that have difficulties
 
01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
have chosen those difficulties for
 
01:57:59.599 --> 01:58:01.189 align:start position:0%
have chosen those difficulties for
themselves

01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
i find these notions damaging
 
01:58:04.239 --> 01:58:07.109 align:start position:0%
i find these notions damaging
um

01:58:07.109 --> 01:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
yet this is the standard the licensing
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
board has chosen for us
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
and again i took it right from their
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
and furthermore they have the right to
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
impose further regulations so when the
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
board created standards they took
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
language from massachusetts that very
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
language caused me to take a year and a
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
half to get licensed after practicing
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
for 10 years in another state without
 
01:58:30.239 --> 01:58:33.350 align:start position:0%
for 10 years in another state without
complaint

01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
even though i passed it the first time
 
01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
13 years before they made me take
 
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
anatomy and physiology one again which i
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
did from a teacher they pulled out of
 
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
very long retirement and we used a 13
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
year old
 
01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
textbook to do that which is when i took
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
it the first time
 
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
i could have been practicing along the
 
01:58:52.229 --> 01:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
first buprenorphine doctor in new
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire in new england for this is for
 
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
treatment for opiate addiction
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
he gave me a room in his clinic but for
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
a year and a half i could not practice
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
no income for a year and a half it cost
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
me 1700 to get licensed here through
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
that process
 
01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
the board sent me a letter of apology
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't pay the rent i'd rather
 
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
have better policy
 
01:59:18.149 --> 01:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
so um please reconsider the authority to
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
create standards in a law for a board
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
that by default endorses astrology
 
01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:23.990 align:start position:0%
that by default endorses astrology
classes

01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
classes
 
01:59:27.270 --> 01:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
as a way to protect the public
 
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
they haven't been allowed under the
 
01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
banner these don't meet our new
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire standards
 
01:59:39.669 --> 01:59:39.679 align:start position:0%
so reciprocity has been unavailable to
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
licensed acupuncturists from 28
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
different states under that banner and
 
01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:46.639 align:start position:0%
are we really to believe that 17 000
 
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists in just five of those
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
states are so unsafe they can't practice
 
01:59:52.709 --> 01:59:52.719 align:start position:0%
in that in new hampshire but they can in
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
those states because we're talking about
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:58.480 --> 01:59:59.910 align:start position:0%
 
massachusetts

01:59:59.910 --> 01:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
02:00:02.229 --> 02:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
so um i'd ask you to support senator
 
02:00:04.950 --> 02:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
guida's current bill sb 330 about
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
reciprocity as that gives authority to
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
the executive director to establish to
 
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
have a voice in establishing those
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
standards which at this point she
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't i have a lot of reasons to have
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
confidence in lindsay courtney her
 
02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
momentum in trying to eliminate delays
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
in licensure and board
 
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
difficulties has been really great as
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
far as i can tell she's doing a great
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
job she had an audit conducted on behalf
 
02:00:32.229 --> 02:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
of oplc that revealed the laidac board
 
02:00:33.910 --> 02:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
to have all the same issues our
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
acupuncture board has with our law with
 
02:00:38.830 --> 02:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
the rules and with board function
 
02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:42.639 align:start position:0%
um i asked for a board review but i'm
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
told we can't get one because it's just
 
02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
too minor and unimportant
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
um this support the report that she got
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
from the audit suggests apprenticeship
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
as a way to bring back
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
work to deal with our workforce shortage
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
and get rid of excessive delays in
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
licensing so thank you again
 
02:01:01.830 --> 02:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
and less didactic training less
 
02:01:04.030 --> 02:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
experience more online training with
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
competency-based assessments new mexico
 
02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
has a excellent competition
 
02:01:10.629 --> 02:01:10.639 align:start position:0%
competency-based assessment of
 
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
practitioners we could replicate that
 
02:01:14.310 --> 02:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
and then when it comes to the
 
02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:15.830 align:start position:0%
and then when it comes to the
supervision

02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
02:01:17.830 --> 02:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
of adss
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
mds and do's are perfectly suited to
 
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
supervise this is totally safe
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
they supervise all 900 michigan trainees
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
they do so in other states so
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
if you use safe needling techniques
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
about the worst thing that happens is a
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
faint and i'm telling you in 30 years
 
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
i've trained over 700 people i made 11
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
trips to louisiana after katrina and the
 
02:01:42.310 --> 02:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
golf spill i have never seen a person
 
02:01:44.550 --> 02:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
faint i've witnessed 10 i've given
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of treatments
 
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
so this is safe so as elizabeth said
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
right now we are the only ones
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
supervising 40 ads's we're supposed to
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
make contact twice a year do you know
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
what it's like catching up 80 times with
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
people in this state who are busy in a
 
02:02:01.199 --> 02:02:02.310 align:start position:0%
people in this state who are busy in a
crisis

02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
we've done it all for free
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
um i don't know of any adss that are
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
charged for this treatment
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh they if the job if their job will let
 
02:02:13.030 --> 02:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
them they do it but they do it as part
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
of their work
 
02:02:16.070 --> 02:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
so we're just asking you we're not
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
asking you for money we just want to
 
02:02:20.070 --> 02:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate limitations and expand
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
services for all of our citizens
 
02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
and i will end with a quote from dr
 
02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
kenneth ryland who went to china with
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
president nixon
 
02:02:30.629 --> 02:02:30.639 align:start position:0%
he says i am convinced that acupuncture
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
is going to be one of the greatest
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
contributions that any group of people
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
has made to the future of all medicine
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
if it is handled correctly by the people
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
of the western world
 
02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
i know it works i saw it work
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
i'm just here to say we have not handled
 
02:02:47.589 --> 02:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
it well
 
02:02:50.070 --> 02:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
we have eliminated our public from being
 
02:02:52.709 --> 02:02:52.719 align:start position:0%
able to access these services
 
02:02:52.719 --> 02:02:53.750 align:start position:0%
able to access these services
um

02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
our profession has created more and more
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
required education
 
02:02:59.589 --> 02:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
when there's many tiers of training that
 
02:02:59.599 --> 02:03:00.870 align:start position:0%
when there's many tiers of training that
exist

02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
exist
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
they're there and there's distinct micro
 
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
systems like the ear
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
those are easily used by most people
 
02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:11.510 align:start position:0%
those are easily used by most people
and

02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
acupuncture is far less regulated in
 
02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
europe and in asia
 
02:03:15.679 --> 02:03:16.390 align:start position:0%
europe and in asia
so

02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
please pass 1192.
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your patience
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative likas
 
02:03:26.709 --> 02:03:26.719 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe i'm a little confused
 
02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
it sounded like you had some complaints
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
about this bill and then you asked us to
 
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
pass it am i did i misunderstand well i
 
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
support this bill and the original
 
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
language i believed struck the
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for nccom as the only route
 
02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
of licensure but the language that i
 
02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
heard earlier today does not remove that
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
i mean are you follow up are you
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
speaking to the language i don't know if
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
you have the bill in front of you i
 
02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
think there's a copy here
 
02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
i do not but it was
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
the licensure i mean the
 
02:04:02.550 --> 02:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
certification through nccom
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
the cali test right and another
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
potential you know we don't want to
 
02:04:11.189 --> 02:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
close the door on potential
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
other potential certifications that can
 
02:04:14.310 --> 02:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
come along
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
right it says after the kelly through
 
02:04:18.069 --> 02:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
examination or credentials documentation
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
reviews see in 2
 
02:04:20.159 --> 02:04:21.669 align:start position:0%
reviews see in 2
1

02:04:21.669 --> 02:04:21.679 align:start position:0%
1
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:34.629 --> 02:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
but then the language i heard discussed
 
02:04:37.109 --> 02:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
today sounds like it does require a
 
02:04:37.119 --> 02:04:38.390 align:start position:0%
today sounds like it does require a
certification

02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
certification
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
well i think the language if i follow up
 
02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
um if you look at line um 26 on starting
 
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
in page two
 
02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
and carrying into the next page
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
is the actual language i don't know
 
02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:52.390 align:start position:0%
is the actual language i don't know
whether

02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
whether
 
02:04:54.790 --> 02:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier accurately
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
reflects that but that's what the
 
02:05:04.149 --> 02:05:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:04.159 --> 02:05:05.189 align:start position:0%
 
that's

02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
line 26 is striking the language around
 
02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:14.229 align:start position:0%
line 26 is striking the language around
ceus

02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
line 26 that i'm looking at strikes and
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
ccm certification continues to require
 
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
at least 30 professional development
 
02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:31.109 align:start position:0%
at least 30 professional development
activities

02:05:31.109 --> 02:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
oh it's page before that sorry
 
02:05:37.589 --> 02:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah starting at line 29 i guess
 
02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:42.709 align:start position:0%
yeah starting at line 29 i guess
right

02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
that says
 
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
they'll give one you're going to be 21
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
you have to have an nccm certification
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
or equivalent certification or pass to
 
02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:54.390 align:start position:0%
or equivalent certification or pass to
california

02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
california
 
02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:57.189 align:start position:0%
so that
that

02:05:57.189 --> 02:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:57.199 --> 02:05:58.470 align:start position:0%
that
requires

02:05:58.470 --> 02:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
requires
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is are you okay with
 
02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:09.679 align:start position:0%
that language or or
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
or not i
 
02:06:19.589 --> 02:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
the apprenticeship was in that list
 
02:06:21.599 --> 02:06:22.709 align:start position:0%
the apprenticeship was in that list
somewhere

02:06:22.709 --> 02:06:22.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
i mean this is saying you have to have a
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes i believe so right that i definitely
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
object to that okay thank you
 
02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
um you know if people have graduated
 
02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
from an accredited college
 
02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
i don't object to them taking a
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
certification there's only one available
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
right now and the cali from california
 
02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
so there's only two available right now
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe apprenticeships can
 
02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
sit for the cali either
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
so if you're requiring that and an
 
02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship it's not going to be able
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
to happen for apprenticeships
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
does any other members have any
 
02:07:23.599 --> 02:07:25.350 align:start position:0%
does any other members have any
questions

02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
i i believe
 
02:07:31.189 --> 02:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
we had heard earlier that there was
 
02:07:31.199 --> 02:07:31.990 align:start position:0%
we had heard earlier that there was
three

02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
three paths here
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
and there's oars in between them
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
so she's objecting to the first one but
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
there are or this other path or this
 
02:07:44.069 --> 02:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
other path if i understood all that
 
02:07:44.079 --> 02:07:45.350 align:start position:0%
other path if i understood all that
correctly

02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:50.629 align:start position:0%
correctly
no

02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:53.350 --> 02:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative like us if you have
 
02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
so as i understand it
 
02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
a is 21 years or older and then
 
02:08:04.069 --> 02:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
i mean each one of the like a b
 
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
c d
 
02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
all have to be
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
met and azhb
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
is the certification you still have to
 
02:08:12.159 --> 02:08:13.189 align:start position:0%
is the certification you still have to
have

02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
ncclm certification or equivalent
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
certification approved by the board or
 
02:08:20.550 --> 02:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
successfully passed the california
 
02:08:22.709 --> 02:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
license exam
 
02:08:22.719 --> 02:08:24.870 align:start position:0%
license exam
um

02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:27.030 --> 02:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
and so that is a requirement b is a
 
02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:28.390 align:start position:0%
and so that is a requirement b is a
requirement

02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
another requirement is you pay the fee d
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
is i think what you're thinking of
 
02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
you have a earned a baccalaureate
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
registered nurse or physician's
 
02:08:38.149 --> 02:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
assistant degree from accredited
 
02:08:40.149 --> 02:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
institution and has a valid current
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
license to practice
 
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
acupuncture from another state or but
 
02:08:46.229 --> 02:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
then on line eight
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
all of that or but no that or is under d
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go back to the previous page
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
i see you know it's kind of like
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
parentheses and doing math or something
 
02:08:58.629 --> 02:08:58.639 align:start position:0%
or has so either you have the
 
02:08:58.639 --> 02:09:00.390 align:start position:0%
or has so either you have the
baccalaureate

02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
baccalaureate
 
02:09:01.589 --> 02:09:01.599 align:start position:0%
um or
 
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
certain other degree of those types or
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
you've successfully completed a
 
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
post-secondary acupuncture college
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
program which is aca om or board
 
02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:11.350 align:start position:0%
program which is aca om or board
approved

02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
approved
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
or has completed a valid internship
 
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
program and it goes on about that so
 
02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
to meet part d there are
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
three options
 
02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
but you still need to have the according
 
02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
to this the
 
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
certification from ncc aom or cali
 
02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:28.629 align:start position:0%
certification from ncc aom or cali
or

02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable with that
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other members
 
02:09:53.910 --> 02:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
from the public that wish to testify
 
02:10:14.550 --> 02:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again madam chair members
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
of the committee lindsay courtney
 
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
executive director oplc
 
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
oplc doesn't take a position on the
 
02:10:24.629 --> 02:10:24.639 align:start position:0%
substance of
 
02:10:26.229 --> 02:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
what's contained in this bill although i
 
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
will say that oplc
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
generally supports portability
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
and so provided that we can ensure that
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
minimum standards are satisfied through
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
other means we would support any method
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
to promote portability
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to
 
02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
draw the committee's attention to the
 
02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
similar fee issue that was discussed
 
02:10:49.589 --> 02:10:49.599 align:start position:0%
previously on another bill it was page
 
02:10:49.599 --> 02:10:50.709 align:start position:0%
previously on another bill it was page
two

02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
line three
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
that would require the applicant to pay
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
the 110 dollar license fee
 
02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:00.310 align:start position:0%
the 110 dollar license fee
this

02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
we're trying to eliminate statutory fees
 
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
for obvious reasons because we need to
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
change fees in order to
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
correspond with the cost allocation so
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
um i would suggest an amendment to
 
02:11:15.189 --> 02:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
completely eliminate that
 
02:11:18.069 --> 02:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
um statutory fee other than that i'd be
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions uh
 
02:11:22.149 --> 02:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
regarding that or anything else that i
 
02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative lekkas
 
02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this is a a question
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
you'd want to answer but um
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
do you see a problem with eliminating on
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
line 29 on the first page
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
that whole
 
02:11:43.350 --> 02:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
section b
 
02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:44.229 align:start position:0%
section b
so

02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
i don't think that
 
02:11:49.270 --> 02:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
that language is going to address uh the
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
concerns that you heard previously
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
the language in 2b requires that there
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
be a certification
 
02:11:59.109 --> 02:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
and the testimony i heard previously was
 
02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
that that constituted a barrier
 
02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
to licensure in this state
 
02:12:06.149 --> 02:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
the requirement that there be an
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
equivalent certification approved by the
 
02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:08.790 align:start position:0%
equivalent certification approved by the
board

02:12:08.790 --> 02:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
the board doesn't issue certification so
 
02:12:13.109 --> 02:12:13.119 align:start position:0%
unless there is an outside entity
 
02:12:14.790 --> 02:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
that provided certifications they
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't essentially the person would
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
have to have nccaom certification
 
02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
and i would also know on page 2 line
 
02:12:26.550 --> 02:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
i think 16
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
again oplc doesn't take a position but
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
generally speaking my observations are
 
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
that when you give a certain amount of
 
02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:35.189 align:start position:0%
that when you give a certain amount of
discretionary

02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
discretionary
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
authority that is listed here in line 17
 
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
that demonstrates a balanced approach of
 
02:12:41.910 --> 02:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
clinical training and fundamental
 
02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:43.510 align:start position:0%
clinical training and fundamental
sciences

02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
sciences
 
02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
that could be a cause for concern to the
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
extent that
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know what that means and it
 
02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
would require the board to promulgate
 
02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:52.470 align:start position:0%
would require the board to promulgate
rules

02:12:52.470 --> 02:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:53.350 align:start position:0%
rules
and

02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:54.629 align:start position:0%
and
sometimes

02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
there there can be
 
02:12:59.109 --> 02:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
another opportunity to you know set high
 
02:13:00.629 --> 02:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
barriers i'm not saying that this board
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
would do that here but that's another
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity i think that you know the
 
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
committee may want to consider
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
um actually creating
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
oplc very much likes concrete
 
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
requirements set forth in statute that
 
02:13:14.709 --> 02:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
limits the ability of regulatory boards
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
to just come up with requirements
 
02:13:20.310 --> 02:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
outside of the statutory construct
 
02:13:22.390 --> 02:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
yeah my question actually was if you saw
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
a problem with
 
02:13:24.719 --> 02:13:26.709 align:start position:0%
a problem with
eliminating

02:13:26.709 --> 02:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
eliminating
 
02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
item b starting on page one line 29. so
 
02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
i can't i can't speak to that i um only
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
well i can speak to that i can say that
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
i fundamentally uh don't agree with
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
requiring a certification that can no
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
longer be obtained so to the extent that
 
02:13:45.119 --> 02:13:45.990 align:start position:0%
longer be obtained so to the extent that
that's

02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:13:47.669 --> 02:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
the requirement
 
02:13:49.589 --> 02:13:49.599 align:start position:0%
i would eliminate the certification
 
02:13:51.430 --> 02:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
requirement because that would certainly
 
02:13:54.069 --> 02:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
impose barriers
 
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:01.990 --> 02:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
um so what you just were remarking on
 
02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
does that mean that you don't feel that
 
02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
the board and olpc are in a position to
 
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
determine what would be
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
an acceptable intern program
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
that you want
 
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
you don't know of any
 
02:14:23.910 --> 02:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
standards of certification i don't i
 
02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
don't i don't even know what it would
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
look like so
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
yeah no i i can only speak for oplc i
 
02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
can't speak for the board i'm sure the
 
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
board um would have opinions as to what
 
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
constitutes a balanced approach of
 
02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
clinical training and fundamental
 
02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:37.430 align:start position:0%
clinical training and fundamental
sciences

02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
sciences
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
except whenever you have something that
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
requires a bit of discretion in there
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
it's an opportunity for disagreement
 
02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
right so if the
 
02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
if the concern here is eliminating
 
02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:49.750 align:start position:0%
if the concern here is eliminating
barriers

02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
barriers
 
02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:51.189 align:start position:0%
barriers
um

02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
you know that would be an opportunity
 
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
for them to regulate
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
and impose certain requirements that are
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
not in statute we generally oplc
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
generally opposes
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
giving that amount of discretion to
 
02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
licensing boards because
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
because it's not concrete it doesn't
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
allow us it doesn't provide for
 
02:15:09.119 --> 02:15:11.189 align:start position:0%
allow us it doesn't provide for
objective

02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
objective
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
means for assessing minimum competency
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure that the board could come
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
up with what they determine as a
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
balanced approach of clinical training
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
and fundamental sciences
 
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
i guess the question is whether or not
 
02:15:23.589 --> 02:15:23.599 align:start position:0%
the committee you know would want to
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
retain that authority for themselves
 
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative fellows recognized for
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up so
 
02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
it seems to me the only way to
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
figure out which interim programs
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
would qualify would be for some
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
some entity if it's not the state of new
 
02:15:45.189 --> 02:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire it would have to be some other
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:15:48.149 --> 02:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
association or whatever
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
that would certify
 
02:15:54.149 --> 02:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
those programs by having visited them
 
02:15:55.510 --> 02:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
and looked at their looked at their
 
02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum or whatever
 
02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
you can do in a number of ways
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
representative you can
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
for many of our practice acts
 
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
the requirements for the education are
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
set explicitly in statute
 
02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:12.870 align:start position:0%
set explicitly in statute
others

02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
others
 
02:16:15.669 --> 02:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
correspond with an accrediting body like
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
you heard earlier in the board of
 
02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:17.750 align:start position:0%
you heard earlier in the board of
medicine

02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
others do provide the discretion to the
 
02:16:22.069 --> 02:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
board to approve education programs and
 
02:16:24.069 --> 02:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
determine so this is the third approach
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying it's a wrong approach i'm
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
just saying if there's a concern
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
regarding portability and barriers you
 
02:16:31.189 --> 02:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
know the committee may want to consider
 
02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
retaining that authority with the
 
02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:34.790 align:start position:0%
retaining that authority with the
legislature

02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
but yeah you can mirror an accrediting
 
02:16:39.030 --> 02:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
body or you can put the requirement the
 
02:16:44.469 --> 02:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:46.070 --> 02:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative lekas
 
02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
on the same section
 
02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
would it i mean it already says that it
 
02:16:58.309 --> 02:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
and which conforms to ncc aom standards
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
what if it just said
 
02:17:02.549 --> 02:17:02.559 align:start position:0%
has completed a valid internship program
 
02:17:04.709 --> 02:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
which conforms to nccaom standards and
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
left the rest out
 
02:17:07.599 --> 02:17:08.790 align:start position:0%
left the rest out
someone's

02:17:08.790 --> 02:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
someone's
 
02:17:09.910 --> 02:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:17:12.629 --> 02:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
i would read what what you just said as
 
02:17:17.669 --> 02:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
not requiring um ncaa om certification
 
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
but just that that they have to come you
 
02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
know they have to basically do
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
meet the same standards and it could be
 
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
a different program so
 
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.110 align:start position:0%
a different program so
um

02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:29.110 --> 02:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
the thing is though i mean how long does
 
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
that program have to be
 
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
so i guess you would say or has
 
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
completed a valid internship program
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
three years minimum and which conforms
 
02:17:38.709 --> 02:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
to nc caom standards
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
to me that would make much more sense um
 
02:17:46.389 --> 02:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
because it would take uh you know
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
the discretion out of it so to speak to
 
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
some extent there's still always
 
02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
discretion but it would eliminate that
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
balanced approach of clinical training
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
because i'm because what's going to
 
02:17:55.589 --> 02:17:55.599 align:start position:0%
happen is there's going to be a long
 
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
discussion right about what's a balanced
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
approach and we're going to have to do
 
02:18:01.030 --> 02:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and it's going to kick this
 
02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:02.469 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and it's going to kick this
out

02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
farther follow-up
 
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
recognized follow-up representation the
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
reason i i didn't include the three
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
years was that
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know if the ncco standards
 
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
has a minimum amount of time but i mean
 
02:18:15.669 --> 02:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
if the program meets the standards i
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
would think adding the three years would
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
be superfluous but
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's a valid point okay thank you
 
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
02:18:27.750 --> 02:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
one of the points that was made was that
 
02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:28.790 align:start position:0%
one of the points that was made was that
this

02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:18:32.709 --> 02:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
this particular nc whatever organization
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
they tended to favor a chinese school of
 
02:18:35.519 --> 02:18:36.309 align:start position:0%
they tended to favor a chinese school of
this

02:18:36.309 --> 02:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
and but there was an alternate korean
 
02:18:41.349 --> 02:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
school and maybe even others that
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%
may be disadvantaged by using this is
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:50.070 --> 02:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh licensing or regulatory or
 
02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
whatever yeah do you have any
 
02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:53.669 align:start position:0%
whatever yeah do you have any
suggestions

02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
i don't um just because i
 
02:18:59.349 --> 02:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
my profession is not um acupuncture uh
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
oplc generally supports though um having
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
alternate methods of licensure and it
 
02:19:08.790 --> 02:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't just be one approach so
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
anything i think that comes out of this
 
02:19:13.509 --> 02:19:13.519 align:start position:0%
committee we would we would support
 
02:19:15.429 --> 02:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
having multiple different approaches and
 
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
not just the ncc aom standards
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
representative scitec as i listened to
 
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
all of this discussion i'm wondering why
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
and how this is mushroomed how come
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
somebody from the board is in here
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
i i can't speak to um
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
representative lekis
 
02:19:43.990 --> 02:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh just uh chair mcguire are you
 
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
thinking of sending this to a
 
02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:49.750 align:start position:0%
thinking of sending this to a
subcommittee

02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
i was afraid i would get that when i
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
answered it so maybe
 
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
so maybe we can continue this uh
 
02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:57.429 align:start position:0%
so maybe we can continue this uh
subcommittee

02:19:57.429 --> 02:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative fellows just one tiny
 
02:20:02.070 --> 02:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
question about how many people are
 
02:20:03.910 --> 02:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
licensed in new hampshire to for
 
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
acupuncture i believe it's in the 150
 
02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:09.110 align:start position:0%
acupuncture i believe it's in the 150
range

02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
range
 
02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
and there's approximately 30
 
02:20:14.710 --> 02:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
ads acupuncture i
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
but that's just based on memory
 
02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:17.349 align:start position:0%
but that's just based on memory

from putting in the card initially
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
because as you can see i'm on the bill
 
02:20:56.790 --> 02:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
but uh i'm very relieved to hear that
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
approving of the idea of having a
 
02:21:03.910 --> 02:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and representative lekkis
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
has already asked a number of extremely
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
useful and valuable questions
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
and we shouldn't be tweaking the
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
language here on the fly
 
02:21:14.550 --> 02:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
we should get it right
 
02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
the first time
 
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
but the reality is that this
 
02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
sub-specialty of acupuncture is a
 
02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
valuable resource and when we had the
 
02:21:26.389 --> 02:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
initial bill
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
what five years ago ms cooley
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
it was a number of years ago
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
the acupuncture board initially
 
02:21:39.309 --> 02:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
had some issues with regard to so-called
 
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
accu-detox in other words the specialty
 
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
that miss cooley and miss rob uh we're
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
talking about where the ear
 
02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
the outer edge of the ear is
 
02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:50.550 align:start position:0%
the outer edge of the ear is
is

02:21:50.550 --> 02:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:21:53.830 --> 02:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
is put as treated with needles i've had
 
02:21:53.840 --> 02:21:54.630 align:start position:0%
is put as treated with needles i've had
the

02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
procedure myself
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
not painful
 
02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:00.870 align:start position:0%
not painful
and

02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
i didn't have any issues it was just an
 
02:22:05.429 --> 02:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
offer to the legislature anybody who
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%

we're all struggling with in terms of
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
getting the language exactly right but

if we can have a subcommittee on this
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%

02:23:14.230 --> 02:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
issues uh and make sure that we can go
 
02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
forward as you i i i don't want to and
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%

02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
miss courtney if there's anybody from
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%

know to be necessary
 
02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
and to get rid of some of these ncaa a1
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
references in the statute
 
02:24:37.990 --> 02:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
so that we can
 
02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
for one thing the the the costs that are

being imposed by the existing statutes
 
02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
for practitioners to have to

an ongoing basis
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
is just
 
02:24:55.750 --> 02:24:55.760 align:start position:0%

i recognize the need for an organized
 
03:05:03.830 --> 03:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
aesthetic practice in the state of new
 
03:05:06.150 --> 03:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire around six years ago
 
03:05:08.150 --> 03:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
in my travels to other states i noticed
 
03:05:09.750 --> 03:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire lacked the cutting
 
03:05:11.510 --> 03:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
edge technology that was available to
 
03:05:13.269 --> 03:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
residents of other states when it came
 
03:05:16.230 --> 03:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
to aesthetic medical procedures
 
03:05:18.309 --> 03:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
about six years ago therefore i started
 
03:05:20.309 --> 03:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
an aesthetic medical practice
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
which to the common layperson is now
 
03:05:24.870 --> 03:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
known as a medical spa
 
03:05:26.950 --> 03:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
we started out by having two physicians
 
03:05:28.550 --> 03:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
and two nurses
 
03:05:28.560 --> 03:05:29.750 align:start position:0%
and two nurses
today

03:05:29.750 --> 03:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:05:31.910 --> 03:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
our medical spa consists of two
 
03:05:34.790 --> 03:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
physicians two four nurse practitioners
 
03:05:37.030 --> 03:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
five registered nurses two estheticians
 
03:05:39.590 --> 03:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
and three front desk personnel
 
03:05:42.309 --> 03:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
in short in the last few years we have
 
03:05:44.309 --> 03:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
grown and so has the need for aesthetic
 
03:05:47.110 --> 03:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
procedures in the state of new hampshire
 
03:05:49.190 --> 03:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
we have been instrumental in bringing
 
03:05:50.950 --> 03:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
cutting edge technology such as cool
 
03:05:53.269 --> 03:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
sculpting for body sculpting various
 
03:05:55.590 --> 03:05:55.600 align:start position:0%

03:05:55.600 --> 03:05:56.950 align:start position:0%
neurotoxin injections and various dermal
fillers

03:05:56.950 --> 03:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
fillers
 
03:05:59.750 --> 03:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
and also the best and latest laser
 
03:06:01.190 --> 03:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
technology to the residents of new
 
03:06:01.200 --> 03:06:02.630 align:start position:0%
technology to the residents of new
hampshire

03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:06:04.150 --> 03:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
prior to that
 
03:06:05.990 --> 03:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of our residents had to cross
 
03:06:07.590 --> 03:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
state borders to try to get these
 
03:06:09.269 --> 03:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
services which were not readily
 
03:06:11.190 --> 03:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
available to them
 
03:06:12.950 --> 03:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
some of the people testifying with me
 
03:06:14.790 --> 03:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
today are basically the pioneers of the
 
03:06:16.389 --> 03:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
aesthetic industry in the state of new
 
03:06:16.399 --> 03:06:17.910 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
03:06:19.910 --> 03:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
our common goal is to make sure that we
 
03:06:21.590 --> 03:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
bring the latest technology that's
 
03:06:23.110 --> 03:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
available to everybody else in the
 
03:06:23.120 --> 03:06:24.950 align:start position:0%
available to everybody else in the
country

03:06:24.950 --> 03:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
country
 
03:06:27.349 --> 03:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
in a safe manner to new hampshire
 
03:06:28.870 --> 03:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that there are a lot of people
 
03:06:31.110 --> 03:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
in this room who are not aware of what a
 
03:06:33.670 --> 03:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
medical spa really is
 
03:06:35.510 --> 03:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
it is essentially an aesthetic medical
 
03:06:37.990 --> 03:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
practice that is run very similar to any
 
03:06:40.309 --> 03:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
other medical practice
 
03:06:43.349 --> 03:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
patients fill out clinical medical
 
03:06:44.710 --> 03:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
history forms
 
03:06:46.309 --> 03:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
these are reviewed by physicians and
 
03:06:47.830 --> 03:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners
 
03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
patients are then assessed by providers
 
03:06:52.790 --> 03:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
and cleared for these treatments
 
03:06:54.790 --> 03:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
these treatments are carried out by

03:07:04.469 --> 03:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
all of our staff undergo extensive

training and supervision prior to
 
03:07:08.710 --> 03:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
performing any of these procedures

electronic health records and
 
03:07:19.750 --> 03:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
essentially treat the patient just as we
 
03:07:22.389 --> 03:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
would in any other medical setting
 
03:07:24.230 --> 03:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
please note that the insurance companies
 
03:07:26.070 --> 03:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
are very stringent about who they insure
 
03:07:28.230 --> 03:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
for medical malpractice
 
03:07:29.750 --> 03:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
if it was felt that the practice was
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
conducting business in an unsafe and
 
03:07:33.349 --> 03:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
unregulated manner they would not
 
03:07:35.269 --> 03:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
provide malpractice insurance to these
 
03:07:35.279 --> 03:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
provide malpractice insurance to these
practices

03:07:36.710 --> 03:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
practices
 
03:07:38.550 --> 03:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
our staff are thoroughly trained before
 
03:07:40.150 --> 03:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
providing any services whether they are
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
neurotoxins karma
 
03:07:43.910 --> 03:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
fillers or lasers
 
03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
some of this training is provided by the
 
03:07:48.070 --> 03:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
vendors of the companies that provide
 
03:07:50.870 --> 03:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
the products and equipment to us
 
03:07:53.429 --> 03:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
in my medical practice i use an emg
 
03:07:55.510 --> 03:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
nerve conduction machine
 
03:07:57.910 --> 03:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
and i do not get any special training
 
03:07:59.830 --> 03:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
from the state for that the training
 
03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
that i've had earlier in my residency
 
03:08:03.269 --> 03:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
and in my practice combined with the
 
03:08:05.429 --> 03:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
vendors training is usually what
 
03:08:05.439 --> 03:08:07.030 align:start position:0%
vendors training is usually what
suffices

03:08:07.030 --> 03:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
suffices
 
03:08:07.040 --> 03:08:08.230 align:start position:0%
suffices
also

03:08:08.230 --> 03:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:08:10.150 --> 03:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
i do botox injections in my medical
 
03:08:12.230 --> 03:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
practice for treating migraine headaches
 
03:08:14.389 --> 03:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
cervical dystonia spasticity and other
 
03:08:15.750 --> 03:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
medical issues
 
03:08:18.469 --> 03:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
i am not mandated to have any specific
 
03:08:20.550 --> 03:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
state training for those
 
03:08:20.560 --> 03:08:21.670 align:start position:0%
state training for those
procedures

03:08:21.670 --> 03:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
03:08:23.910 --> 03:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
i believe the same rules should apply to
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
a medical spa setting
 
03:08:28.230 --> 03:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
i do not know of any instance where the
 
03:08:30.230 --> 03:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
medical director of a medical spa was
 
03:08:33.110 --> 03:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
not readily available when needed
 
03:08:35.030 --> 03:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
i do not see the need for any direct
 
03:08:36.790 --> 03:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
on-site supervision
 
03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
from the medical director
 
03:08:40.950 --> 03:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
i treat patients in various settings and
 
03:08:43.269 --> 03:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
when i'm on call i get multiple calls
 
03:08:45.269 --> 03:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
wherein a nurse assesses the patient and
 
03:08:47.510 --> 03:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
provides me with the details and the
 
03:08:49.670 --> 03:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
status of the patient based on that
 
03:08:51.349 --> 03:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
information i have to make an informed
 
03:08:53.110 --> 03:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
decision about
 
03:08:53.120 --> 03:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
decision about
the

03:08:53.990 --> 03:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:54.950 align:start position:0%
the
care

03:08:54.950 --> 03:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:08:56.630 --> 03:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
the nurse then carries out the order
 
03:08:59.349 --> 03:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
that is given to them by the physician
 
03:09:00.950 --> 03:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
i do not see why it should be any
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
different in an aesthetic medical
 
03:09:05.110 --> 03:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
practice setting
 
03:09:07.429 --> 03:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
i do not have to supervise a nurse on
 
03:09:09.510 --> 03:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
site in a hospital setting when they are
 
03:09:09.520 --> 03:09:10.950 align:start position:0%
site in a hospital setting when they are
administrating

03:09:10.950 --> 03:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
administrating
 
03:09:13.190 --> 03:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
iv antibiotics or iv blood products
 
03:09:15.269 --> 03:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
based on my orders
 
03:09:17.429 --> 03:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
today also the use of telehealth to
 
03:09:19.190 --> 03:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
assess patients and treat patients is
 
03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
acceptable and mainstream in the
 
03:09:22.229 --> 03:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
practice of medicine
 
03:09:24.070 --> 03:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
this too should be an accepted form of
 
03:09:26.790 --> 03:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
communication and assessment of patients
 
03:09:30.070 --> 03:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
in any setting including medical spas
 
03:09:32.309 --> 03:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
i am not sure how many of you are aware
 
03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
that the rules for medical aesthetic
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
practices vary from state to state
 
03:09:38.710 --> 03:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
in the state of massachusetts a licensed
 
03:09:41.190 --> 03:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
laser technician such as an aesthetician
 
03:09:43.110 --> 03:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
can run a laser machine
 
03:09:44.630 --> 03:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
but in the state of in the state of new
 
03:09:46.630 --> 03:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire a laser machine can only be
 
03:09:48.229 --> 03:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
run by a registered nurse a nurse
 
03:09:50.070 --> 03:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
practitioner or a physician
 
03:09:52.710 --> 03:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
it would be really easy for all of us to
 
03:09:54.710 --> 03:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
open an aesthetic medical practice in
 
03:09:56.309 --> 03:09:56.319 align:start position:0%
the state of massachusetts as it would
 
03:09:59.110 --> 03:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
be more cost effective however our
 
03:10:01.269 --> 03:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
common goal has been to make basic
 
03:10:02.870 --> 03:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
aesthetic technology available to
 
03:10:04.389 --> 03:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
residents of new hampshire in the safest
 
03:10:05.990 --> 03:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
manner possible
 
03:10:08.550 --> 03:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
any new unnecessary and stringent laws
 
03:10:10.710 --> 03:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
would therefore make our residents drive
 
03:10:12.469 --> 03:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
across state borders to massachusetts
 
03:10:14.790 --> 03:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
vermont and maine to get basic aesthetic
 
03:10:16.389 --> 03:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
procedures and
 
03:10:18.309 --> 03:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
this would result in loss of revenue and
 
03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
loss of jobs for the state of new
 
03:10:19.760 --> 03:10:20.950 align:start position:0%
loss of jobs for the state of new
hampshire

03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:10:22.630 --> 03:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
as you all know in this difficult day
 
03:10:24.790 --> 03:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
and age healthcare professionals as well
 
03:10:26.550 --> 03:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
as various services and products are in
 
03:10:27.990 --> 03:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
short supply
 
03:10:29.830 --> 03:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
it would be an unnecessary burden to
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
further impose stricter regulations that
 
03:10:33.110 --> 03:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
would harm the current aesthetic
 
03:10:35.110 --> 03:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
industry in the state
 
03:10:36.309 --> 03:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that there are
 
03:10:37.990 --> 03:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
various other practices that are
 
03:10:39.429 --> 03:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
offering cosmetic procedures and
 
03:10:41.190 --> 03:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
non-cosmetic procedures under the same
 
03:10:42.710 --> 03:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
medical practice
 
03:10:44.950 --> 03:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
it is unclear if this legislation would
 
03:10:46.950 --> 03:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
even target those established medical
 
03:10:48.469 --> 03:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
practices from providing those
 
03:10:51.110 --> 03:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
procedures on the side
 
03:10:52.790 --> 03:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
i would also like to point out that this
 
03:10:55.269 --> 03:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
legislation targets cosmetic medical
 
03:10:57.030 --> 03:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
procedures which are really not well
 
03:10:57.040 --> 03:10:58.309 align:start position:0%
procedures which are really not well
defined

03:10:58.309 --> 03:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
defined
 
03:11:00.469 --> 03:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
in a medical spa setting we take care of
 
03:11:02.950 --> 03:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
various other medical issues also such
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
as acne scars weight management
 
03:11:05.520 --> 03:11:07.030 align:start position:0%
as acne scars weight management
hyperhidrosis

03:11:07.030 --> 03:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
hyperhidrosis
 
03:11:09.110 --> 03:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
and various other medical issues
 
03:11:11.349 --> 03:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
we are essentially improving the overall
 
03:11:13.349 --> 03:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
physical and mental well-being of our
 
03:11:15.910 --> 03:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
patients with these procedures
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
we have also started a non-profit
 
03:11:19.750 --> 03:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
organization called the aesthetic
 
03:11:22.309 --> 03:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
medical providers of new hampshire this
 
03:11:24.550 --> 03:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
consists of physicians registered nurses
 
03:11:27.190 --> 03:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners physician assistants
 
03:11:29.030 --> 03:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
and other providers
 
03:11:30.710 --> 03:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
our goal is to make sure that the
 
03:11:32.229 --> 03:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
aesthetic procedures in the state of new
 
03:11:33.750 --> 03:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire are carried out in a safe
 
03:11:36.229 --> 03:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
manner with adequate training this
 
03:11:38.469 --> 03:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization will provide the
 
03:11:40.150 --> 03:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
necessary resources that aesthetic
 
03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
practices need
 
03:11:43.269 --> 03:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
to operate safely in the state of new
 
03:11:43.279 --> 03:11:44.550 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
03:11:46.229 --> 03:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that
 
03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
medical aesthetic practices and medical
 
03:11:50.790 --> 03:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
spas are differentiated from hair salons
 
03:11:52.870 --> 03:11:52.880 align:start position:0%

we are essentially a medical grade
 
03:11:58.870 --> 03:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
practice following all hipaa rules
 
03:12:00.469 --> 03:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
conducting medical evaluation of
 
03:12:02.790 --> 03:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
patients before treatment having signed
 
03:12:05.190 --> 03:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
consents for all treatments documenting
 
03:12:08.389 --> 03:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
in electronic medical records and
 
03:12:09.670 --> 03:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
everything else that is done in a
 
03:12:12.229 --> 03:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
medical practice setting
 
03:12:14.469 --> 03:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
please note that all our staff are also
 
03:12:16.469 --> 03:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
governed by our respective boards in the
 
03:12:18.070 --> 03:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire such as the board
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
of medicine the board of nursing etc
 
03:12:22.790 --> 03:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
irrespective of whatever setting we're
 
03:12:22.800 --> 03:12:24.469 align:start position:0%
irrespective of whatever setting we're
practicing

03:12:24.469 --> 03:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
practicing
 
03:12:27.110 --> 03:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
having any other entity oversee or
 
03:12:29.590 --> 03:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
practice would only mean over regulation
 
03:12:31.269 --> 03:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
which i believe in this case is not
 
03:12:31.279 --> 03:12:32.710 align:start position:0%
which i believe in this case is not
necessary

03:12:32.710 --> 03:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:12:35.590 --> 03:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:37.670 --> 03:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:12:39.830 --> 03:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
will you take questions sure
 
03:12:42.229 --> 03:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
03:12:43.590 --> 03:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you for
 
03:12:47.030 --> 03:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:12:49.590 --> 03:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
03:12:52.150 --> 03:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
is that a person's medical insurance
 
03:12:54.550 --> 03:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
will not cover any of the procedures
 
03:12:56.389 --> 03:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
that are done at any of these medical
 
03:12:58.550 --> 03:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
spas is that correct
 
03:13:00.389 --> 03:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
03:13:02.229 --> 03:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
medical insurances will not cover these
 
03:13:04.630 --> 03:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
procedures however
 
03:13:04.640 --> 03:13:05.510 align:start position:0%
procedures however
if

03:13:05.510 --> 03:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:13:05.520 --> 03:13:06.389 align:start position:0%
if
we

03:13:06.389 --> 03:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:13:09.190 --> 03:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
get a patient that is transitioning
 
03:13:11.030 --> 03:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
a certain portion of their laser hair
 
03:13:13.269 --> 03:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
removal is considered
 
03:13:14.870 --> 03:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
medically necessary and this will be
 
03:13:16.469 --> 03:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
covered by insurances which will be
 
03:13:18.550 --> 03:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
reimbursed back to the patient
 
03:13:21.830 --> 03:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
also if we are carrying out botox for
 
03:13:23.429 --> 03:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
procedures such as migraine headaches
 
03:13:25.110 --> 03:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
again the patient can get reimbursed
 
03:13:28.389 --> 03:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
back from the insurance
 
03:13:30.550 --> 03:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:13:33.269 --> 03:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:37.429 --> 03:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:37.439 --> 03:13:38.630 align:start position:0%

03:13:38.630 --> 03:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
jessica
 
03:13:57.349 --> 03:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:59.510 --> 03:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair members of
 
03:14:01.429 --> 03:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is jessica
 
03:14:03.750 --> 03:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
callapolidas i am the director for the
 
03:14:05.830 --> 03:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
division of enforcement at the office of
 
03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
03:14:11.670 --> 03:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
i am here on behalf of oplc today in
 
03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
support of house bill 1444.
 
03:14:17.990 --> 03:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
um i did submit written testimony so i'm
 
03:14:20.150 --> 03:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
not going to
 
03:14:22.229 --> 03:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
take much time i'll be brief
 
03:14:23.990 --> 03:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
i did want to highlight a couple of
 
03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:25.429 align:start position:0%
i did want to highlight a couple of
points

03:14:25.429 --> 03:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
points
 
03:14:27.670 --> 03:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
um this is seen as a necessary measure
 
03:14:30.389 --> 03:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
to ensure the safety of the public
 
03:14:32.309 --> 03:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
it would require the registration of
 
03:14:35.030 --> 03:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
medical spas which that would allow us
 
03:14:37.110 --> 03:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
to proactively
 
03:14:40.710 --> 03:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
inspect those facilities
 
03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
proactive inspection is important
 
03:14:46.070 --> 03:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
currently we cannot investigate
 
03:14:47.910 --> 03:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
unless there is a complaint filed at
 
03:14:49.510 --> 03:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
that point the public has already been
 
03:14:49.520 --> 03:14:53.750 align:start position:0%
that point the public has already been
harmed

03:14:53.750 --> 03:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:55.910 --> 03:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
the services procedures and treatments
 
03:14:57.990 --> 03:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
that are provided at medical spas are
 
03:15:00.870 --> 03:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
just that they are medical in nature
 
03:15:02.710 --> 03:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that they are for purely
 
03:15:05.030 --> 03:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
cosmetic reasons does not take away from
 
03:15:06.550 --> 03:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that these are medical
 
03:15:08.550 --> 03:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
procedures treatments and services that
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
are being provided
 
03:15:12.950 --> 03:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
and they do require the proper oversight
 
03:15:15.030 --> 03:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
training supervision and delegation by
 
03:15:18.710 --> 03:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:20.469 --> 03:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
the boards of medicine
 
03:15:22.710 --> 03:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
nursing pharmacy and the board of
 
03:15:24.550 --> 03:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
barbering cosmetology and aesthetics
 
03:15:26.710 --> 03:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
have all provided letters in support
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
these are the boards that oversee the
 
03:15:30.630 --> 03:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
various licensees that work in medical
 
03:15:30.640 --> 03:15:31.910 align:start position:0%
various licensees that work in medical
spas

03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
spas
 
03:15:34.309 --> 03:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
and they support this as a needed
 
03:15:34.319 --> 03:15:37.349 align:start position:0%
and they support this as a needed
measure

03:15:37.349 --> 03:15:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:39.510 --> 03:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
the medical spa industry is growing and
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
can be quite lucrative
 
03:15:44.309 --> 03:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
this growing industry will benefit we
 
03:15:46.469 --> 03:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
believe from this legislation as it will
 
03:15:49.510 --> 03:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
increase consumer confidence
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
in these procedures and treatments being
 
03:15:54.870 --> 03:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
received by consumers in new hampshire
 
03:15:56.389 --> 03:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
it'll increase confidence that they are
 
03:15:58.150 --> 03:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
being done safely
 
03:16:00.229 --> 03:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
and by those medically qualified to
 
03:16:03.590 --> 03:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
oversee and delegate them
 
03:16:05.750 --> 03:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
the proactive inspections would also
 
03:16:07.830 --> 03:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
increase consumer confidence
 
03:16:09.910 --> 03:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
because again instead of waiting until a
 
03:16:11.670 --> 03:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
complaint is filed when injury has
 
03:16:13.590 --> 03:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
already occurred to investigate it would
 
03:16:14.950 --> 03:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
allow us to go in
 
03:16:14.960 --> 03:16:16.469 align:start position:0%
allow us to go in
proactively

03:16:16.469 --> 03:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
proactively
 
03:16:18.550 --> 03:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
and to help assist
 
03:16:20.550 --> 03:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
those facilities with correcting
 
03:16:22.550 --> 03:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
anything that needs to be fixed to bring
 
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:28.150 --> 03:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
the only other thing i will mention is
 
03:16:29.670 --> 03:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
that in speaking with representative
 
03:16:30.870 --> 03:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
merchant today
 
03:16:33.510 --> 03:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
um an item was brought to our attention
 
03:16:35.349 --> 03:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
and we will be seeking an amendment to
 
03:16:37.830 --> 03:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
address that item that he he brought to
 
03:16:39.349 --> 03:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
our attention
 
03:16:43.510 --> 03:16:43.520 align:start position:0%

thank you representative goalie
 
03:16:49.269 --> 03:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:16:51.830 --> 03:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:16:54.389 --> 03:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
we heard in previous testimony
 
03:16:54.399 --> 03:16:55.349 align:start position:0%
we heard in previous testimony
that

03:16:55.349 --> 03:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:57.030 --> 03:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
a majority of the procedures done at
 
03:16:58.630 --> 03:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
these facilities is not covered by
 
03:16:58.640 --> 03:17:00.630 align:start position:0%
these facilities is not covered by
insurance

03:17:00.630 --> 03:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:17:00.640 --> 03:17:01.510 align:start position:0%
insurance
now

03:17:01.510 --> 03:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:17:04.229 --> 03:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
if something goes wrong and there's no
 
03:17:05.670 --> 03:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
oversight or your
 
03:17:07.750 --> 03:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
board cannot get in there to investigate
 
03:17:10.070 --> 03:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
make sure everything's run properly
 
03:17:12.790 --> 03:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
then would it not be upon that
 
03:17:15.590 --> 03:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
individual to seek
 
03:17:15.600 --> 03:17:17.670 align:start position:0%
individual to seek
uh

03:17:17.670 --> 03:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:17:19.429 --> 03:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
some remedies to something that might
 
03:17:20.550 --> 03:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
have been done wrong during the
 
03:17:22.150 --> 03:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
procedure versus an insurance company
 
03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
trying to recover those costs for that
 
03:17:25.030 --> 03:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
individual wouldn't it come out of that
 
03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
person's pocket to try and recoup if
 
03:17:26.880 --> 03:17:27.910 align:start position:0%
person's pocket to try and recoup if
something

03:17:27.910 --> 03:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:17:29.429 --> 03:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
had been done wrong and harm that
 
03:17:32.309 --> 03:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
individual on a certain procedure
 
03:17:35.269 --> 03:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
um i'm uncertain it may come down to
 
03:17:37.429 --> 03:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
their malpractice insurance
 
03:17:39.429 --> 03:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
or they may have civil
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
remedies i'm not certain follow
 
03:17:45.349 --> 03:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
but it would be the individual patient's
 
03:17:48.150 --> 03:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
obligation to foot the bill to
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
try and recoup whatever was done wrong
 
03:17:52.790 --> 03:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
against that malpractice insurance
 
03:17:52.800 --> 03:17:57.510 align:start position:0%
against that malpractice insurance
if

03:17:57.510 --> 03:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:59.269 --> 03:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
yes they would not go through
 
03:18:01.030 --> 03:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
their if their insurance did not cover
 
03:18:02.389 --> 03:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
it i don't believe that the insurance
 
03:18:04.469 --> 03:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
company would assist them in recouping
 
03:18:07.349 --> 03:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
that cost they could file a complaint
 
03:18:09.349 --> 03:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
against the specific licensee if they're
 
03:18:11.429 --> 03:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
aware of who that is
 
03:18:13.510 --> 03:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
but medical spas there's many different
 
03:18:15.910 --> 03:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
types of licensees and we've actually
 
03:18:19.030 --> 03:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
have had complaints eventually filed by
 
03:18:20.389 --> 03:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
what i would consider to be a very
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
sophisticated complainant who did not
 
03:18:24.309 --> 03:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
understand that they could file a
 
03:18:26.229 --> 03:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
complaint until much later in the
 
03:18:26.239 --> 03:18:29.670 align:start position:0%
complaint until much later in the
process

03:18:29.670 --> 03:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:32.070 --> 03:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
this i think helps clarify that they can
 
03:18:35.429 --> 03:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
in fact file a complaint with our office
 
03:18:37.190 --> 03:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
it would go before the board
 
03:18:39.750 --> 03:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
if it was a doctor let's say who had
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
caused the harm it would go before the
 
03:18:43.190 --> 03:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
board of medicine
 
03:18:44.630 --> 03:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
the authority still rests with the
 
03:18:47.030 --> 03:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
various boards of these licensees the
 
03:18:49.590 --> 03:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
registration again the main purpose is
 
03:18:51.990 --> 03:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
to allow us proactive inspections thank
 
03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:55.830 align:start position:0%
to allow us proactive inspections thank
you

03:18:55.830 --> 03:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:59.110 --> 03:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:00.630 --> 03:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:19:02.710 --> 03:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
i thank you for being here today so you
 
03:19:05.670 --> 03:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
referenced in your testimony before
 
03:19:07.510 --> 03:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative goldie's question that
 
03:19:09.190 --> 03:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
you would be seeking an amendment can
 
03:19:12.150 --> 03:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
you clarify what you're talking or what
 
03:19:12.160 --> 03:19:13.110 align:start position:0%
you clarify what you're talking or what
your

03:19:13.110 --> 03:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:19:17.190 --> 03:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
procedure is with regard to that or
 
03:19:18.790 --> 03:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
you have somebody who's going to be
 
03:19:20.950 --> 03:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
offering an amendment or
 
03:19:22.550 --> 03:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of the statement
 
03:19:24.710 --> 03:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
that you were seeking an amendment
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
um it was to just put the committee on
 
03:19:29.510 --> 03:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
notice um again i've been speaking with
 
03:19:31.590 --> 03:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
03:19:31.600 --> 03:19:32.389 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
he

03:19:32.389 --> 03:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
he
 
03:19:34.070 --> 03:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
brought something forward regarding the
 
03:19:36.150 --> 03:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals that we think should be
 
03:19:36.160 --> 03:19:38.550 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals that we think should be
included

03:19:38.550 --> 03:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
included
 
03:19:40.630 --> 03:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i'm qualified to
 
03:19:42.630 --> 03:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
explain the details in the specifics but
 
03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's where that amendment will be
 
03:19:45.670 --> 03:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
coming from i'll ask representative
 
03:19:47.910 --> 03:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
merchant if he intends to test the story
 
03:19:47.920 --> 03:19:49.590 align:start position:0%
merchant if he intends to test the story
okay

03:19:49.590 --> 03:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:19:51.110 --> 03:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative scitec you have
 
03:19:52.950 --> 03:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
a question
 
03:19:54.790 --> 03:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
yes you said you're going to be
 
03:19:57.349 --> 03:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
proactively looking inspecting these
 
03:19:57.359 --> 03:19:58.830 align:start position:0%
proactively looking inspecting these
places

03:19:58.830 --> 03:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
places
 
03:20:01.750 --> 03:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh previous testimony has been that this
 
03:20:04.630 --> 03:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
is a medical establishment who do you
 
03:20:07.830 --> 03:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
does oplc is it qualified do you inspect
 
03:20:10.550 --> 03:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
doctor's offices
 
03:20:11.910 --> 03:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
who would be
 
03:20:15.830 --> 03:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know who who does that does anyone
 
03:20:17.830 --> 03:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
so our pharmaceutical inspectors can
 
03:20:17.840 --> 03:20:18.870 align:start position:0%
so our pharmaceutical inspectors can
provide

03:20:18.870 --> 03:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
certain providers
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
in regards to the pharmaceuticals
 
03:20:23.040 --> 03:20:24.469 align:start position:0%
in regards to the pharmaceuticals
specifically

03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:20:26.309 --> 03:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
one of our pharmaceutical inspectors is
 
03:20:27.910 --> 03:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
here and she'll testify i think she'll
 
03:20:30.070 --> 03:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
be better able to explain what it is
 
03:20:31.910 --> 03:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
that she's able to do in the limitations
 
03:20:35.990 --> 03:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:38.150 --> 03:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
but this would we would have to hire an
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
inspector who was qualified to do this
 
03:20:41.750 --> 03:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
work they would go in it would be
 
03:20:43.750 --> 03:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
03:20:46.550 --> 03:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
barber shops and cosmetologists
 
03:20:46.560 --> 03:20:48.309 align:start position:0%
barber shops and cosmetologists
estheticians

03:20:48.309 --> 03:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
estheticians
 
03:20:50.550 --> 03:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
they have to file for shop licenses and
 
03:20:52.550 --> 03:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
we can't inspect those we do inspect
 
03:20:55.269 --> 03:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
them upon opening and then up to twice a
 
03:20:57.349 --> 03:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
year after those are proactive
 
03:20:59.670 --> 03:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
inspections to ensure that everybody
 
03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
working there is properly licensed and
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
that they are compliant with all of the
 
03:21:05.510 --> 03:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
rules um
 
03:21:08.309 --> 03:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
of the board because that is it protects
 
03:21:10.229 --> 03:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
the public by ensuring that all health
 
03:21:11.750 --> 03:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
and sanitary
 
03:21:15.269 --> 03:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:17.110 --> 03:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rhodes
 
03:21:18.469 --> 03:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you for
 
03:21:22.229 --> 03:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:22.239 --> 03:21:23.190 align:start position:0%
 
to

03:21:23.190 --> 03:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
kind of clarify
 
03:21:26.630 --> 03:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
what representative scitec was just
 
03:21:29.190 --> 03:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
asking so you're saying that
 
03:21:31.349 --> 03:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
proactive inspection and you're saying
 
03:21:31.359 --> 03:21:32.309 align:start position:0%
proactive inspection and you're saying
that

03:21:32.309 --> 03:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:21:35.190 --> 03:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
the board of cosmetology barbering etc
 
03:21:37.510 --> 03:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
was all in favor of this bill so
 
03:21:39.750 --> 03:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
if you could clarify for me my
 
03:21:41.429 --> 03:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
understanding is the board of
 
03:21:44.630 --> 03:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
cosmetology aesthetics barbering
 
03:21:46.790 --> 03:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
individuals go to school to be trained
 
03:21:47.990 --> 03:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:21:50.150 --> 03:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
03:21:51.910 --> 03:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
that particular board is following up
 
03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:52.950 align:start position:0%
that particular board is following up
with

03:21:52.950 --> 03:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:21:55.190 --> 03:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
inspection so if these individuals are
 
03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
not going to school for barbering
 
03:21:59.190 --> 03:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
cosmetology aesthetics etc then why
 
03:22:00.710 --> 03:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
would that be the
 
03:22:02.710 --> 03:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
why would they be the ones following up
 
03:22:02.720 --> 03:22:04.070 align:start position:0%
why would they be the ones following up
with

03:22:04.070 --> 03:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:22:07.750 --> 03:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
inspections of these facilities
 
03:22:09.110 --> 03:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
if i understand your question i
 
03:22:10.870 --> 03:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
apologize if i don't but if i understand
 
03:22:12.630 --> 03:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
your question it would not be our
 
03:22:15.030 --> 03:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
cosmetology inspectors who would be
 
03:22:16.710 --> 03:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
conducting inspections of the medical
 
03:22:16.720 --> 03:22:17.670 align:start position:0%
conducting inspections of the medical
spas

03:22:17.670 --> 03:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
spas
 
03:22:19.349 --> 03:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
it would we would hire an inspector who
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
was qualified
 
03:22:23.190 --> 03:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
to inspect them
 
03:22:26.309 --> 03:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question
 
03:22:26.319 --> 03:22:27.110 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question
what

03:22:27.110 --> 03:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
what particular i guess practice is
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to be the ones that are going to
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
be inspecting
 
03:22:34.790 --> 03:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
we would have to determine what those
 
03:22:36.550 --> 03:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
qualifications are
 
03:22:39.830 --> 03:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
um because there are so many different
 
03:22:41.670 --> 03:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
licensee types it would have to be
 
03:22:43.429 --> 03:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
somebody i think has a certain amount of
 
03:22:45.429 --> 03:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
medical knowledge
 
03:22:48.469 --> 03:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
possibly pharmaceutical knowledge in
 
03:22:51.349 --> 03:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
order to properly inspect
 
03:22:53.670 --> 03:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
but the job the job requirements and
 
03:22:54.950 --> 03:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
classification would have to be
 
03:22:54.960 --> 03:22:59.349 align:start position:0%
classification would have to be
determined

03:22:59.349 --> 03:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:03.030 --> 03:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
so to follow up with that on line 20
 
03:23:04.630 --> 03:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
where it says does not meaningfully
 
03:23:06.389 --> 03:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
promote the proper function of the body
 
03:23:08.790 --> 03:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
or prevent or treat illness or disease
 
03:23:11.190 --> 03:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
i i think where my confusion is coming
 
03:23:13.510 --> 03:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
in is i'm hearing
 
03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
border cosmetology i'm hearing
 
03:23:16.870 --> 03:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
aesthetics now i'm hearing
 
03:23:16.880 --> 03:23:17.590 align:start position:0%
aesthetics now i'm hearing
uh

03:23:17.590 --> 03:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:23:20.309 --> 03:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
possible medical practice or
 
03:23:20.319 --> 03:23:22.389 align:start position:0%
possible medical practice or
pharmaceutical

03:23:22.389 --> 03:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical
 
03:23:24.309 --> 03:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
but we also just heard that
 
03:23:26.469 --> 03:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
insurance does not pay a friend of these
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
procedures so i guess i'm a little bit
 
03:23:31.110 --> 03:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
confused on
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
are we staying in our own lane here or
 
03:23:35.349 --> 03:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
is it just a
 
03:23:37.590 --> 03:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
i guess just a mix of what you feel like
 
03:23:39.269 --> 03:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
so these are medical cosmetic procedures
 
03:23:44.630 --> 03:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
they are medical procedures treatments
 
03:23:46.309 --> 03:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
and services that are provided for
 
03:23:51.990 --> 03:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:53.429 --> 03:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
i have a question
 
03:23:55.910 --> 03:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
does the oplc and the board of medicine
 
03:23:58.389 --> 03:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
inspect doctors offices or surgical
 
03:23:59.590 --> 03:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
centers or
 
03:23:59.600 --> 03:24:00.630 align:start position:0%
centers or
or

03:24:00.630 --> 03:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:24:03.429 --> 03:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
urgent care clinics
 
03:24:06.389 --> 03:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
um our pharmac so the board of medicine
 
03:24:08.550 --> 03:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
board of pharmacy
 
03:24:10.870 --> 03:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay the board of medicine does not
 
03:24:10.880 --> 03:24:13.269 align:start position:0%
okay the board of medicine does not
inspect

03:24:13.269 --> 03:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
inspect
 
03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
the board of pharmacy their inspectors
 
03:24:18.870 --> 03:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
may inspect providers
 
03:24:20.550 --> 03:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you that was all i wanted thank
 
03:24:20.560 --> 03:24:22.790 align:start position:0%
thank you that was all i wanted thank
you

03:24:22.790 --> 03:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
03:24:27.110 --> 03:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien thank you madam
 
03:24:29.349 --> 03:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
chairman uh chairwoman
 
03:24:31.349 --> 03:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
i'm just a little bit confused you said
 
03:24:33.670 --> 03:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
your division would do you send out
 
03:24:35.429 --> 03:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
people and it sounds like the position
 
03:24:38.229 --> 03:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
does not exist but does it not exist
 
03:24:40.309 --> 03:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in state government i'm
 
03:24:42.630 --> 03:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid a potential redundancy
 
03:24:44.229 --> 03:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
of services
 
03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge it does not exist in
 
03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
state government state service somewhere
 
03:24:50.469 --> 03:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
else okay thank you
 
03:24:52.229 --> 03:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:24:54.550 --> 03:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
any additional questions representatives
 
03:24:56.710 --> 03:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you
 
03:24:58.870 --> 03:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
um i don't see anything
 
03:25:01.030 --> 03:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
in this bill maybe i'm missing it and
 
03:25:03.349 --> 03:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
you can point it out to me but my
 
03:25:05.670 --> 03:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
question has to do with is there any
 
03:25:08.630 --> 03:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
kind of board that will oversee this or
 
03:25:11.429 --> 03:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
at least an advisory board that knows
 
03:25:11.439 --> 03:25:12.790 align:start position:0%
at least an advisory board that knows
about

03:25:12.790 --> 03:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:25:16.150 --> 03:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
medspar operations
 
03:25:17.830 --> 03:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
no you are not
 
03:25:20.710 --> 03:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
you're correct that's not in this bill
 
03:25:24.309 --> 03:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
it would be a registration with oplc
 
03:25:26.070 --> 03:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
but if
 
03:25:27.510 --> 03:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
things were found that needed to be
 
03:25:29.110 --> 03:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
referred it would be referred to one of
 
03:25:31.590 --> 03:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
the boards that currently has authority
 
03:25:33.269 --> 03:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
over the licensees that work in medical
 
03:25:34.870 --> 03:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
spas we're not looking to create an
 
03:25:40.389 --> 03:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:43.110 --> 03:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
so you're saying if the inspector went
 
03:25:46.229 --> 03:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
in and found something that didn't seem
 
03:25:48.630 --> 03:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
right it would
 
03:25:49.590 --> 03:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
have to
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
they'd have to identify the person
 
03:25:52.560 --> 03:25:53.429 align:start position:0%
they'd have to identify the person
who

03:25:53.429 --> 03:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:25:55.429 --> 03:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
is responsible for that and if it's a
 
03:25:56.950 --> 03:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
physician it goes to the board of
 
03:25:59.030 --> 03:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
medicine and if it's a nurse it goes to
 
03:26:00.950 --> 03:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
the board of nursing
 
03:26:02.469 --> 03:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
correct we are not looking to take
 
03:26:05.030 --> 03:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
authority away from the boards
 
03:26:08.950 --> 03:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:26:13.110 --> 03:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:26:15.110 --> 03:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
i believe in your earlier testimony you
 
03:26:15.120 --> 03:26:15.990 align:start position:0%
i believe in your earlier testimony you
stated

03:26:15.990 --> 03:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
stated
 
03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:16.790 align:start position:0%
stated
that

03:26:16.790 --> 03:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:26:18.469 --> 03:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
an inspector in the case of these
 
03:26:20.469 --> 03:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
medical spas could only go in if the
 
03:26:23.190 --> 03:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
complaint had been lodged and then
 
03:26:25.349 --> 03:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
potentially that harm had already
 
03:26:25.359 --> 03:26:26.870 align:start position:0%
potentially that harm had already
occurred

03:26:26.870 --> 03:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
03:26:30.870 --> 03:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
the cosmetology board and the other
 
03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
boards that you supervise at oplc
 
03:26:37.590 --> 03:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
can and do regularly inspect but on an
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
unannounced basis they can go in they
 
03:26:42.229 --> 03:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
don't have to have a complaint lodge
 
03:26:44.870 --> 03:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
so why the difference in
 
03:26:46.870 --> 03:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the causation if you will or
 
03:26:49.429 --> 03:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
authorization for an inspection with
 
03:26:49.439 --> 03:26:50.389 align:start position:0%
authorization for an inspection with
this

03:26:50.389 --> 03:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:26:52.150 --> 03:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
type of facility
 
03:26:53.990 --> 03:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
03:26:55.349 --> 03:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:26:56.870 --> 03:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
you're correct there are current
 
03:27:02.150 --> 03:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:04.870 --> 03:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
mechanical and you know electrical they
 
03:27:07.349 --> 03:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
can all perform proactive inspections
 
03:27:08.870 --> 03:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
which is what we're trying to bring here
 
03:27:11.429 --> 03:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
to medical medical spas so cosmetology
 
03:27:13.510 --> 03:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
for instance there may be an esthetician
 
03:27:15.269 --> 03:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
who works at a medical spa but if they
 
03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a shop license
 
03:27:19.269 --> 03:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
then we don't we don't know that they're
 
03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
there and we don't know that we can go
 
03:27:22.870 --> 03:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
and inspect them if they do have a shop
 
03:27:24.950 --> 03:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
license within the medical spa
 
03:27:24.960 --> 03:27:25.990 align:start position:0%
license within the medical spa
then

03:27:25.990 --> 03:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:27:29.269 --> 03:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
our inspectors our cosmo inspectors are
 
03:27:31.750 --> 03:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
limited to inspecting that shop within
 
03:27:34.309 --> 03:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
the medical spa they cannot inspect the
 
03:27:35.830 --> 03:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
remainder they're not qualified to
 
03:27:35.840 --> 03:27:37.349 align:start position:0%
remainder they're not qualified to
inspect

03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
inspect
 
03:27:38.790 --> 03:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
what the doctors are doing they're not
 
03:27:40.790 --> 03:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
qualified to inspect the pharmaceuticals
 
03:27:42.070 --> 03:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
and the other things they would be very
 
03:27:45.190 --> 03:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
limited to that shop which may be a room
 
03:27:48.150 --> 03:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
within the medical spa
 
03:27:50.950 --> 03:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:27:52.790 --> 03:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:27:54.710 --> 03:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
as i understood it you said that this
 
03:27:56.469 --> 03:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
sort of uh
 
03:27:58.309 --> 03:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
inspection is not done of doctor's
 
03:27:59.590 --> 03:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
offices where they do a variety of
 
03:28:01.510 --> 03:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
medical procedures i would assume that
 
03:28:03.030 --> 03:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
if there's a complaint it's the
 
03:28:05.429 --> 03:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
particular practitioner there
 
03:28:07.670 --> 03:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
what's special about medical spas that
 
03:28:09.830 --> 03:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
would require this whereas doctor's
 
03:28:13.190 --> 03:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:14.790 --> 03:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
the difference i think with the medical
 
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
spas is that because they're cosmetic
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
procedures they're cosmetic for cosmetic
 
03:28:23.110 --> 03:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
reasons even though they are medical
 
03:28:25.510 --> 03:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
we are seeing more and more people
 
03:28:27.750 --> 03:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
who are getting into the med spa game we
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
are seeing more and more people who are
 
03:28:31.110 --> 03:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps not qualified there is a greater
 
03:28:33.269 --> 03:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
risk to the public
 
03:28:35.269 --> 03:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
with what is occurring at medical spas
 
03:28:37.190 --> 03:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
than there is at regular
 
03:28:40.870 --> 03:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
doctor's offices if you will follow-up
 
03:28:40.880 --> 03:28:41.750 align:start position:0%
doctor's offices if you will follow-up
um

03:28:41.750 --> 03:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:43.269 --> 03:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
i mean if they're doing medical
 
03:28:45.349 --> 03:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
procedures at these spas
 
03:28:48.229 --> 03:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
aren't they required to be licensed as
 
03:28:50.389 --> 03:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate to whatever practice they're
 
03:28:51.510 --> 03:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
03:28:55.030 --> 03:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
as would it be in a doctor's office
 
03:28:57.429 --> 03:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
you're correct they should be
 
03:29:00.550 --> 03:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
but they are not always
 
03:29:03.110 --> 03:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:05.750 --> 03:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
president goalie
 
03:29:07.670 --> 03:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and just to follow
 
03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
up on that line
 
03:29:12.790 --> 03:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:15.750 --> 03:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
would inspecting them be one way of
 
03:29:17.429 --> 03:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
finding out that those that are there
 
03:29:19.910 --> 03:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
practicing and doing the procedures are
 
03:29:21.910 --> 03:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
correctly qualified to produce those
 
03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
procedures and have the
 
03:29:26.389 --> 03:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
certifications necessary yes
 
03:29:26.399 --> 03:29:28.630 align:start position:0%
certifications necessary yes

follow-up
and

03:29:30.229 --> 03:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:33.030 --> 03:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
as you just stated isn't it the job of
 
03:29:33.040 --> 03:29:35.190 align:start position:0%
as you just stated isn't it the job of
oplc

03:29:35.190 --> 03:29:35.200 align:start position:0%

make sure any registration license they
 
03:29:41.030 --> 03:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
need to do is
 
03:29:44.710 --> 03:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
in the best benefit of the public
 
03:29:44.720 --> 03:29:46.309 align:start position:0%
in the best benefit of the public
yes

03:29:46.309 --> 03:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:29:48.150 --> 03:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and just one last question i
 
03:29:50.870 --> 03:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can answer this or not
 
03:29:50.880 --> 03:29:51.910 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can answer this or not
we've

03:29:51.910 --> 03:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
we've
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
heard from the doctor about how big the
 
03:29:57.590 --> 03:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
practice is that he's been in and how
 
03:29:59.590 --> 03:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
prolific this is becoming here in the
 
03:30:01.429 --> 03:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
03:30:02.950 --> 03:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
do you know how many facilities would
 
03:30:04.710 --> 03:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
fit this definition currently in new
 
03:30:06.150 --> 03:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire or how many are practicing
 
03:30:09.190 --> 03:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:11.910 --> 03:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
i do not have a specific number
 
03:30:14.229 --> 03:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
i do not have that information i can
 
03:30:16.309 --> 03:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
attempt to do some research and if if i
 
03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:23.830 --> 03:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
other questions representative scitec
 
03:30:26.150 --> 03:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
this idea of inspections is interesting
 
03:30:29.349 --> 03:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:32.229 --> 03:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
shop the aesthetics cosmetology one of
 
03:30:33.830 --> 03:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
these places do you ask to see their
 
03:30:36.309 --> 03:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
licenses is that part of the inspection
 
03:30:38.469 --> 03:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
okay they've got to show that they're
 
03:30:40.870 --> 03:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
they're not only just clean floors but
 
03:30:42.309 --> 03:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
they've got to show that they they're
 
03:30:43.830 --> 03:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
the real thing
 
03:30:45.830 --> 03:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely making sure that everyone
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
is properly licensed is part of the
 
03:30:47.520 --> 03:30:51.590 align:start position:0%
is properly licensed is part of the

if this at these particular facilities

would the person that is performing this
 
03:31:05.269 --> 03:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
this procedure
 
03:31:08.389 --> 03:31:08.399 align:start position:0%

03:32:47.990 --> 03:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:50.070 --> 03:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
at the at the medical practice we
 
03:32:53.590 --> 03:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
perform all of the injectables and
 
03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
laser treatments and on the first floor
 
03:32:57.590 --> 03:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
below us we do
 
03:33:00.070 --> 03:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
massage and regular facials and things
 
03:33:01.110 --> 03:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
like that
 
03:33:01.120 --> 03:33:02.710 align:start position:0%
like that
um

03:33:02.710 --> 03:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:04.630 --> 03:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
i have
 
03:33:06.389 --> 03:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
to say that i feel that this is
 
03:33:10.070 --> 03:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
definitely duplicative we are subject to
 
03:33:10.080 --> 03:33:11.510 align:start position:0%
definitely duplicative we are subject to
inspections

03:33:11.510 --> 03:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
um randomly and
 
03:33:15.670 --> 03:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
in looking into things all of the boards
 
03:33:21.510 --> 03:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
for the most part have some position
 
03:33:22.870 --> 03:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
statement about
 
03:33:22.880 --> 03:33:24.710 align:start position:0%
statement about
safety

03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
safety
 
03:33:27.510 --> 03:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
the board of nursing
 
03:33:29.750 --> 03:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
has a position statement already
 
03:33:33.830 --> 03:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
stating that um the clinical practice
 
03:33:36.469 --> 03:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
advisory regarding the role of nurses in
 
03:33:39.030 --> 03:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
cosmetic services
 
03:33:41.830 --> 03:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
that their delegated skills performed
 
03:33:45.510 --> 03:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
under the supervision of a physician or
 
03:33:48.150 --> 03:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
an aprn and training and competency
 
03:33:50.630 --> 03:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
requirements are already listed under
 
03:33:53.429 --> 03:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
nursing 405.01 pertaining to these
 
03:33:55.750 --> 03:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
services their statement even goes on to
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
explain that a medical provider should
 
03:33:59.830 --> 03:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
be available to the nurse
 
03:34:01.990 --> 03:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
for supervision in person or by
 
03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
telecommunication methods and must be
 
03:34:06.309 --> 03:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
available within four hours of the
 
03:34:06.319 --> 03:34:07.590 align:start position:0%
available within four hours of the
treatment

03:34:07.590 --> 03:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
03:34:09.750 --> 03:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
physicians assistant board also has a
 
03:34:11.910 --> 03:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
published statement on safety regarding
 
03:34:14.389 --> 03:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
cosmetic procedures the cosmetology
 
03:34:17.670 --> 03:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
board is very clear that aesthetics and
 
03:34:20.309 --> 03:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
massage therapists cannot do medical spa
 
03:34:22.870 --> 03:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
treatments puncture the skin injections
 
03:34:24.790 --> 03:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
or anything like that
 
03:34:24.800 --> 03:34:26.389 align:start position:0%
or anything like that
so

03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:29.349 --> 03:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
i think if there is a safety concern it
 
03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
should be brought to the boards and say
 
03:34:34.150 --> 03:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
here are some safety perimeters and
 
03:34:36.550 --> 03:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
let's you know can you update your your
 
03:34:39.510 --> 03:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
position statement on this and give your
 
03:34:42.630 --> 03:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
licensees some best practice guidelines
 
03:34:44.469 --> 03:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
i don't feel that we need to have a
 
03:34:46.870 --> 03:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
whole nother regulatory board another
 
03:34:48.710 --> 03:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
fee for our med spas right now we're
 
03:34:50.710 --> 03:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
already recovering from covid
 
03:34:53.030 --> 03:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
we don't need to you know have all these
 
03:34:54.790 --> 03:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
additional inspections
 
03:34:54.800 --> 03:34:56.229 align:start position:0%
additional inspections
we

03:34:56.229 --> 03:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:34:59.670 --> 03:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
answer to our boards we have to practice
 
03:35:01.429 --> 03:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
medicine ethically
 
03:35:01.439 --> 03:35:02.229 align:start position:0%
medicine ethically
and

03:35:02.229 --> 03:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:04.710 --> 03:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
if someone is doing medicine without a
 
03:35:07.429 --> 03:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
license there are ramifications for that
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
already in place
 
03:35:12.229 --> 03:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
jail being one of them so you know that
 
03:35:15.190 --> 03:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:16.870 --> 03:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:35:19.190 --> 03:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know i definitely think that
 
03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
this is over regulation duplication of
 
03:35:25.990 --> 03:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
existing regulatory boards
 
03:35:26.000 --> 03:35:27.190 align:start position:0%
existing regulatory boards
and

03:35:27.190 --> 03:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:28.870 --> 03:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
you know i just i don't think any of us
 
03:35:32.150 --> 03:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:33.429 --> 03:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:35:35.110 --> 03:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative will you answer some
 
03:35:35.120 --> 03:35:38.790 align:start position:0%
representative will you answer some
questions

03:35:38.790 --> 03:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:40.950 --> 03:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
will you answer some questions yes
 
03:35:43.349 --> 03:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
03:35:45.269 --> 03:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:35:46.870 --> 03:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
being here to testify and answer my
 
03:35:46.880 --> 03:35:47.830 align:start position:0%
being here to testify and answer my
questions

03:35:47.830 --> 03:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:35:49.910 --> 03:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
um you stated that you
 
03:35:51.750 --> 03:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
are already in
 
03:35:54.710 --> 03:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
receiving inspections could you tell me
 
03:35:56.790 --> 03:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
if that's in the medical spa portion of
 
03:35:59.349 --> 03:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
your facility and who and how often does
 
03:36:02.229 --> 03:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
that inspection um so
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
our board had asked
 
03:36:07.349 --> 03:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
us to sign up for voluntary inspections
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
and so some of my colleagues have
 
03:36:11.429 --> 03:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
already been inspected there was no
 
03:36:13.590 --> 03:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know there wasn't anything that
 
03:36:13.600 --> 03:36:15.349 align:start position:0%
you know there wasn't anything that
happened

03:36:15.349 --> 03:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
happened
 
03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
and i think boards can ask that if you
 
03:36:19.910 --> 03:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
know within the guidelines that they put
 
03:36:23.110 --> 03:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
out for best practices too
 
03:36:24.950 --> 03:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:36:27.510 --> 03:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
we have the board of cosmetology come in
 
03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
and inspect
 
03:36:31.429 --> 03:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
the first floor and then upstairs where
 
03:36:34.150 --> 03:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
i perform the medical procedures board
 
03:36:37.110 --> 03:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
of pharmacy could come in any time
 
03:36:37.120 --> 03:36:39.990 align:start position:0%
of pharmacy could come in any time
unannounced

03:36:39.990 --> 03:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:43.349 --> 03:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
thank you but do do you have a
 
03:36:45.190 --> 03:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
the board of medicine or the board of
 
03:36:47.429 --> 03:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
naturopathic medicine come in
 
03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh no i mean
 
03:36:51.429 --> 03:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
and if something was going on at a
 
03:36:53.590 --> 03:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
medical spa that wasn't right someone
 
03:36:55.830 --> 03:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
would have to stand around there all day
 
03:36:58.710 --> 03:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
and watch for an unauthorized person to
 
03:37:00.309 --> 03:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
inject you know what i mean i don't
 
03:37:01.510 --> 03:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
think that
 
03:37:03.670 --> 03:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
that something that is really
 
03:37:03.680 --> 03:37:05.429 align:start position:0%
that something that is really
even

03:37:05.429 --> 03:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
even
 
03:37:07.110 --> 03:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's i don't think that that
 
03:37:08.790 --> 03:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
standard like no one comes in when i'm
 
03:37:10.710 --> 03:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
having a regular office visit with a
 
03:37:12.630 --> 03:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
patient and inspects there's nothing to
 
03:37:14.790 --> 03:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
inspect really
 
03:37:16.469 --> 03:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
unless you know you're
 
03:37:18.389 --> 03:37:18.399 align:start position:0%
injecting pharmaceuticals and then i
 
03:37:19.830 --> 03:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
think that that's appropriate for the
 
03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
board of pharmacy to come in
 
03:37:23.349 --> 03:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and so just to
 
03:37:24.960 --> 03:37:25.990 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and so just to
clarify

03:37:25.990 --> 03:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
03:37:27.830 --> 03:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
the medical spa portion on your second
 
03:37:31.429 --> 03:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
floor the only one that may come in and
 
03:37:34.870 --> 03:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
inspect would be the board of pharmacy
 
03:37:36.229 --> 03:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
03:37:38.790 --> 03:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
unless i have the estheticians
 
03:37:41.429 --> 03:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
performing facials upstairs and then i
 
03:37:43.110 --> 03:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
would have their license clearly
 
03:37:44.550 --> 03:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
displayed because everybody's required
 
03:37:47.030 --> 03:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
to display lice licenses
 
03:37:49.269 --> 03:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
and i would have to have a shop license
 
03:37:49.279 --> 03:37:50.309 align:start position:0%
and i would have to have a shop license
there

03:37:50.309 --> 03:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:37:51.910 --> 03:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
and do that
 
03:37:51.920 --> 03:37:53.590 align:start position:0%
and do that
so

03:37:53.590 --> 03:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
be the board of cosmetology but it's not
 
03:37:58.389 --> 03:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
an inspection
 
03:38:01.670 --> 03:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
it would also be an inspection if i had
 
03:38:01.680 --> 03:38:03.030 align:start position:0%
it would also be an inspection if i had
estheticians

03:38:03.030 --> 03:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
estheticians
 
03:38:04.710 --> 03:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
on the medical floor
 
03:38:09.030 --> 03:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
so my situation is a little unique but
 
03:38:10.870 --> 03:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
the point is that you know there are
 
03:38:13.190 --> 03:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
boards to regulate these things already
 
03:38:14.550 --> 03:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
and maybe they just need a little
 
03:38:14.560 --> 03:38:16.469 align:start position:0%
and maybe they just need a little
assistance

03:38:16.469 --> 03:38:16.479 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
03:38:16.479 --> 03:38:18.469 align:start position:0%
assistance
updating

03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
updating
 
03:38:20.710 --> 03:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
if if you feel that there is a safety
 
03:38:20.720 --> 03:38:21.910 align:start position:0%
if if you feel that there is a safety
issue

03:38:21.910 --> 03:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:38:23.269 --> 03:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
then i feel like that should be brought
 
03:38:25.750 --> 03:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
to their respective boards to help guide
 
03:38:30.870 --> 03:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:30.880 --> 03:38:37.269 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:38:37.269 --> 03:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:40.790 --> 03:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
you are talking about uh
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state inspector or
 
03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
or one of the uh
 
03:38:48.550 --> 03:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
employees who inspect that
 
03:38:48.560 --> 03:38:49.830 align:start position:0%
employees who inspect that
um

03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:53.189 --> 03:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry no no i'm trying to to
 
03:38:55.429 --> 03:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
to to know if
 
03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
this you bring the state inspector there
 
03:39:02.790 --> 03:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
to inspect or somebody else or regular
 
03:39:06.389 --> 03:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:08.870 --> 03:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
so i think it someone mentioned earlier
 
03:39:10.469 --> 03:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
medical offices
 
03:39:12.710 --> 03:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't have a reason to be
 
03:39:14.150 --> 03:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
inspected other than the board of
 
03:39:14.160 --> 03:39:15.910 align:start position:0%
inspected other than the board of
pharmacy

03:39:15.910 --> 03:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
03:39:15.920 --> 03:39:18.150 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
um

03:39:18.150 --> 03:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:20.950 --> 03:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
unless yeah i can't think of any other
 
03:39:23.830 --> 03:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know issues that come up typically
 
03:39:27.750 --> 03:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
aren't you know
 
03:39:29.910 --> 03:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
injectables or pharmaceuticals
 
03:39:29.920 --> 03:39:31.349 align:start position:0%
injectables or pharmaceuticals
so

03:39:31.349 --> 03:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:34.950 --> 03:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:37.269 --> 03:39:37.279 align:start position:0%
other ques other questions
 
03:39:37.279 --> 03:39:38.870 align:start position:0%

in regards to the inspections
 
03:41:18.309 --> 03:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
the board of pharmacy
 
03:41:19.670 --> 03:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
this has been a hotly contested
 
03:41:19.680 --> 03:41:20.950 align:start position:0%
this has been a hotly contested
situation

03:41:20.950 --> 03:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:41:22.229 --> 03:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
between ourselves and the board of
 
03:41:22.239 --> 03:41:23.590 align:start position:0%
between ourselves and the board of
medicine

03:41:23.590 --> 03:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
03:41:25.510 --> 03:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
the board of pharmacy goes in to inspect
 
03:41:27.349 --> 03:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
for the safe storage and handling of
 
03:41:27.359 --> 03:41:28.790 align:start position:0%
for the safe storage and handling of
pharmaceuticals

03:41:28.790 --> 03:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
03:41:32.309 --> 03:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
repeat it does not
 
03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
inspect for aseptic technique how the
 
03:41:35.590 --> 03:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
drug is prepared
 
03:41:37.110 --> 03:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
nor does it inspect for the
 
03:41:38.790 --> 03:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
administration of the product
 
03:41:39.990 --> 03:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
this committee has been through that
 
03:41:42.309 --> 03:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
process before and has clearly come down
 
03:41:43.349 --> 03:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
and saying that that's not
 
03:41:46.950 --> 03:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:48.790 --> 03:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to also
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
say to you folks
 
03:41:52.710 --> 03:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
one of the things in the bill although i
 
03:41:54.389 --> 03:41:54.399 align:start position:0%
think the intent is there
 
03:41:57.910 --> 03:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
i did offer to work with the
 
03:41:59.910 --> 03:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill and also those who
 
03:42:02.070 --> 03:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
are working with the sponsor on the bill
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
to provide language to the clarification
 
03:42:05.429 --> 03:42:05.439 align:start position:0%
to it
 
03:42:07.670 --> 03:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we may want to
 
03:42:07.680 --> 03:42:08.790 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we may want to
consider

03:42:08.790 --> 03:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:42:11.349 --> 03:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
03:42:12.950 --> 03:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
the reason why people don't open a
 
03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
pharmacy without a license is because
 
03:42:16.790 --> 03:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
nobody will ship to the location unless
 
03:42:18.229 --> 03:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
they have a license
 
03:42:20.710 --> 03:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
so one of the things to try to do is to
 
03:42:22.070 --> 03:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
amend the bill
 
03:42:24.229 --> 03:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
to insist that the license has to be
 
03:42:26.150 --> 03:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
there and allow the people who ship
 
03:42:28.309 --> 03:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
products which are the wholesalers
 
03:42:30.229 --> 03:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
are on the hook if you will for sending
 
03:42:32.550 --> 03:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
a product to an unlicensed facility
 
03:42:35.030 --> 03:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's just gives them an opportunity to
 
03:42:37.269 --> 03:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
do this so that's kind of what i was
 
03:42:38.710 --> 03:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish through the
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
discussion with people before
 
03:42:42.950 --> 03:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
and talking about an amendment
 
03:42:44.309 --> 03:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
if there's any other things you folks
 
03:42:45.990 --> 03:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
like me to try to clarify
 
03:42:47.910 --> 03:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
based on my limited knowledge be more
 
03:42:50.469 --> 03:42:50.479 align:start position:0%

03:45:03.670 --> 03:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
many of you
 
03:45:05.189 --> 03:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
may have not have been aware of what a
 
03:45:06.870 --> 03:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
medical spa was
 
03:45:09.110 --> 03:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
before hearing this bill
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
medical spas are medical practices
 
03:45:15.189 --> 03:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
this bill begins with the premise that
 
03:45:18.070 --> 03:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
medical spas are not regulated
 
03:45:19.830 --> 03:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
indeed we are
 
03:45:22.229 --> 03:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
every medical procedure i perform in my
 
03:45:22.239 --> 03:45:23.189 align:start position:0%
every medical procedure i perform in my
office

03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
office
 
03:45:25.510 --> 03:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
whether cosmetic or otherwise
 
03:45:28.950 --> 03:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
is regulated by my medical board
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
whether i'm performing a cosmetic botox
 
03:45:34.150 --> 03:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
treatment or performing a non-cosmetic
 
03:45:34.160 --> 03:45:35.590 align:start position:0%
treatment or performing a non-cosmetic
treatment

03:45:35.590 --> 03:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
03:45:37.670 --> 03:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
my assessment of the patient
 
03:45:37.680 --> 03:45:39.189 align:start position:0%
my assessment of the patient
diagnosis

03:45:39.189 --> 03:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
03:45:40.950 --> 03:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
informed consent
 
03:45:43.030 --> 03:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
treatment and documentation of the
 
03:45:46.870 --> 03:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
encounter is the same
 
03:45:49.110 --> 03:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
the same is true for the other regulated
 
03:45:51.030 --> 03:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
professions practicing aesthetic
 
03:45:53.269 --> 03:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
medicine such as physicians nurse
 
03:45:53.279 --> 03:45:55.189 align:start position:0%
medicine such as physicians nurse
practitioners

03:45:55.189 --> 03:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
03:45:55.199 --> 03:45:57.510 align:start position:0%
practitioners
etc

03:45:57.510 --> 03:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
etc
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
i would also argue there are many
 
03:46:02.710 --> 03:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
services in a medical spa that are not
 
03:46:05.189 --> 03:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
cosmetic in nature
 
03:46:07.110 --> 03:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
for example my colleague has already
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
spoke about botox for migraine headaches
 
03:46:13.510 --> 03:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
tmj hyperhidrosis
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
other medical spas offer services that
 
03:46:18.630 --> 03:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
involve weight loss sexual wellness and
 
03:46:20.950 --> 03:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
many others
 
03:46:23.030 --> 03:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
i've spent
 
03:46:25.349 --> 03:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
over a hundred thousand dollars in
 
03:46:27.269 --> 03:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
additional training in aesthetic
 
03:46:27.279 --> 03:46:28.790 align:start position:0%
additional training in aesthetic
medicine

03:46:28.790 --> 03:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
03:46:31.189 --> 03:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
it is common place for doctors to
 
03:46:33.269 --> 03:46:33.279 align:start position:0%
complete training for in-office
 
03:46:33.279 --> 03:46:34.469 align:start position:0%
complete training for in-office
procedures

03:46:34.469 --> 03:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
03:46:37.510 --> 03:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
with or without devices after medical
 
03:46:37.520 --> 03:46:38.870 align:start position:0%
with or without devices after medical
school

03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:46:41.750 --> 03:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
for example lasers are used in various
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
fields in addition to aesthetic medicine
 
03:46:47.830 --> 03:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
specific injection training or drug
 
03:46:50.469 --> 03:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
administration may also be learned after
 
03:46:53.030 --> 03:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
medical school especially as new
 
03:46:55.830 --> 03:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
treatments become approved
 
03:46:58.389 --> 03:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
these procedures and devices do not
 
03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
warrant having a separate regulatory
 
03:47:00.720 --> 03:47:02.070 align:start position:0%
warrant having a separate regulatory
board

03:47:02.070 --> 03:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:47:04.790 --> 03:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
it appears that this industry
 
03:47:07.189 --> 03:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
has been singled out while other
 
03:47:07.199 --> 03:47:08.710 align:start position:0%
has been singled out while other
sub-specialties

03:47:08.710 --> 03:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
sub-specialties
 
03:47:11.269 --> 03:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps those with more inherent risks
 
03:47:12.469 --> 03:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
to patients
 
03:47:14.150 --> 03:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
have not
 
03:47:16.630 --> 03:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
it's also important to note that
 
03:47:19.110 --> 03:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance will not cover
 
03:47:21.429 --> 03:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
procedures in which you are not
 
03:47:25.110 --> 03:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:27.349 --> 03:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a high
 
03:47:30.389 --> 03:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
safety record of aesthetic procedures
 
03:47:33.030 --> 03:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
it has actually been impossible to find
 
03:47:35.990 --> 03:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
public record of incidents that suggest
 
03:47:36.000 --> 03:47:39.910 align:start position:0%
public record of incidents that suggest
otherwise

03:47:39.910 --> 03:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
in fact medical aesthetic practices must
 
03:47:46.710 --> 03:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
build their businesses on reputation
 
03:47:49.670 --> 03:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
safety and results
 
03:47:52.389 --> 03:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
i'm also confused as to the timing of
 
03:47:55.830 --> 03:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
this bill since so many small businesses
 
03:47:58.150 --> 03:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
have already suffered as a result of
 
03:47:58.160 --> 03:48:00.630 align:start position:0%
have already suffered as a result of
kovid

03:48:00.630 --> 03:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
kovid
 
03:48:04.630 --> 03:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
this law also goes beyond the proactive
 
03:48:04.640 --> 03:48:06.150 align:start position:0%
this law also goes beyond the proactive
inspection

03:48:06.150 --> 03:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
03:48:07.990 --> 03:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
passing this law would make new
 
03:48:10.309 --> 03:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire one of the most regulated
 
03:48:13.349 --> 03:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
states to practice aesthetic medicine
 
03:48:16.950 --> 03:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
on par with california and new york
 
03:48:18.550 --> 03:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
it would take our patients to
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
neighboring states where treatments
 
03:48:23.189 --> 03:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
would inevitably cost less
 
03:48:25.510 --> 03:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
this would pose additional risks to
 
03:48:27.910 --> 03:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
patients since their provider would not
 
03:48:31.510 --> 03:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
be close should an urgent concern arise
 
03:48:34.389 --> 03:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
it would also reduce jobs in the state
 
03:48:37.030 --> 03:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
and lastly it would disproportionately
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
affect women
 
03:48:40.790 --> 03:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
since the majority of many spa owners in
 
03:48:44.550 --> 03:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
the state are women
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
i believe this bill was created through
 
03:48:49.349 --> 03:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
a lack of information and perhaps
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
misinformation about the industry in new
 
03:48:51.760 --> 03:48:53.429 align:start position:0%
misinformation about the industry in new
hampshire

03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:48:56.229 --> 03:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
in fact we were able to locate a very
 
03:48:58.630 --> 03:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
similar version of this bill on the
 
03:49:00.710 --> 03:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
american dermatology association's
 
03:49:03.429 --> 03:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
website and we understand that this
 
03:49:06.150 --> 03:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
national organization is pushing this
 
03:49:09.269 --> 03:49:09.279 align:start position:0%
type of legislation nationwide in order
 
03:49:11.750 --> 03:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
to take back the cash business that
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
these treatments create
 
03:49:15.830 --> 03:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation will drive
 
03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
business to neighboring states at the
 
03:49:20.229 --> 03:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
cost of new hampshire patients and
 
03:49:22.870 --> 03:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers i am urging you to consider
 
03:49:29.110 --> 03:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.349 --> 03:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:33.349 --> 03:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
03:49:35.750 --> 03:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so you're clearly
 
03:49:37.670 --> 03:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
reading us a prepared statement it can
 
03:49:37.680 --> 03:49:38.469 align:start position:0%
reading us a prepared statement it can
you

03:49:38.469 --> 03:49:38.479 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:49:39.910 --> 03:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
since you're making a number of
 
03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
allegations about this legislation
 
03:49:45.110 --> 03:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
which i'm not a sponsor of so i'm
 
03:49:47.110 --> 03:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
neutral on the whole issue can you
 
03:49:50.550 --> 03:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
provide us with a copy of your testimony
 
03:49:52.710 --> 03:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
yeah if my government relations team
 
03:49:55.429 --> 03:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
advises me of such i will be happy to
 
03:49:57.349 --> 03:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
okay well you're you're being recorded
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
so yes and i know um
 
03:50:03.429 --> 03:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
did we provide them with the package
 
03:50:05.670 --> 03:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
okay yes they will provide that
 
03:50:09.189 --> 03:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
is public so yes that's fine okay
 
03:50:10.870 --> 03:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
yes that's it'll just save us from
 
03:50:13.429 --> 03:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting it sure
 
03:50:15.670 --> 03:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
03:50:18.070 --> 03:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:50:21.990 --> 03:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question i've heard numerous
 
03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:23.910 align:start position:0%
taking my question i've heard numerous
times

03:50:23.910 --> 03:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
times
 
03:50:26.630 --> 03:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
in testimony that
 
03:50:28.630 --> 03:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
over here man
 
03:50:31.910 --> 03:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
oh sorry there is a
 
03:50:33.670 --> 03:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
individuals wouldn't get medical
 
03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
malpractice if they didn't do something
 
03:50:36.960 --> 03:50:39.349 align:start position:0%
malpractice if they didn't do something
correctly

03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
03:50:41.830 --> 03:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
is there a requirement to open up a med
 
03:50:45.429 --> 03:50:45.439 align:start position:0%
spa to have malpractice insurance
 
03:50:48.469 --> 03:50:48.479 align:start position:0%
i don't think any provider would be able
 
03:50:48.479 --> 03:50:50.229 align:start position:0%
i don't think any provider would be able
to

03:50:50.229 --> 03:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
practice without medical
 
03:50:55.110 --> 03:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
malpractice in the state
 
03:50:57.030 --> 03:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up senator goalie since we don't
 
03:50:59.189 --> 03:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
have any regulations on medical spas
 
03:51:02.950 --> 03:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
there can't be such a requirement
 
03:51:05.110 --> 03:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
unless it's from the board of medicine
 
03:51:06.710 --> 03:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm trying is their
 
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
requirement because we've heard they
 
03:51:09.269 --> 03:51:09.279 align:start position:0%
would not be insured if they did
 
03:51:11.269 --> 03:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
something wrong but if it's not a
 
03:51:11.279 --> 03:51:13.510 align:start position:0%
something wrong but if it's not a
requirement

03:51:13.510 --> 03:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
03:51:15.590 --> 03:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
then there's no protection
 
03:51:18.309 --> 03:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
so if someone was to file a claim
 
03:51:20.950 --> 03:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
and you didn't have medical malpractice
 
03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
you as an individual would be
 
03:51:22.640 --> 03:51:23.910 align:start position:0%
you as an individual would be
responsible

03:51:23.910 --> 03:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
03:51:27.349 --> 03:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:29.349 --> 03:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
but i can't speak as to what the
 
03:51:31.110 --> 03:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
requirements would be for all the boards
 
03:51:32.469 --> 03:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
03:51:34.229 --> 03:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance i've just never
 
03:51:36.229 --> 03:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
heard of someone wanting to practice
 
03:51:42.150 --> 03:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:44.469 --> 03:51:44.479 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
03:51:46.630 --> 03:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair doctor thank you
 
03:51:48.469 --> 03:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:51:50.870 --> 03:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh in your testimony you mentioned there
 
03:51:53.030 --> 03:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
would be some financial burden if this
 
03:51:54.710 --> 03:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
bill would go through
 
03:51:57.030 --> 03:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh other than the malpractice can you
 
03:51:58.630 --> 03:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
explain what some of those
 
03:52:00.790 --> 03:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
what would be burdensome i think
 
03:52:04.229 --> 03:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
whenever we have additional regulation
 
03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
and compliance issues that drives our
 
03:52:08.550 --> 03:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
practice costs up
 
03:52:11.110 --> 03:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
when our practice costs
 
03:52:13.750 --> 03:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
increase then unfortunately that
 
03:52:15.670 --> 03:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
translates to increased costs for
 
03:52:15.680 --> 03:52:16.870 align:start position:0%
translates to increased costs for
patients

03:52:16.870 --> 03:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
patients
 
03:52:19.510 --> 03:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
so if we're competing
 
03:52:21.910 --> 03:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
like me i'm in a town that's close to
 
03:52:25.349 --> 03:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
the border there's nothing to say that
 
03:52:27.189 --> 03:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
patients wouldn't travel
 
03:52:29.030 --> 03:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
to a neighboring state to receive
 
03:52:32.469 --> 03:52:32.479 align:start position:0%
services at a more competitive price
 
03:52:32.479 --> 03:52:34.150 align:start position:0%
services at a more competitive price
point

03:52:34.150 --> 03:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:52:36.469 --> 03:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
i do think
 
03:52:38.150 --> 03:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's a consideration
 
03:52:41.830 --> 03:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
anytime we have additional regulations
 
03:52:44.070 --> 03:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:46.870 --> 03:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:52:47.830 --> 03:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:49.990 --> 03:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what kind of regulation
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
exists in massachusetts because we've
 
03:52:54.870 --> 03:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
heard several people say that you know
 
03:52:55.910 --> 03:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
they would
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
move to massachusetts or it would be
 
03:53:00.870 --> 03:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
cheaper to practice in massachusetts um
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
we can provide that for you if i believe
 
03:53:06.309 --> 03:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
our government relations team did a
 
03:53:08.070 --> 03:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
summary of the neighborhood the laws in
 
03:53:09.429 --> 03:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
the neighboring states if you would like
 
03:53:10.950 --> 03:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
us to thank you that would be very
 
03:53:13.349 --> 03:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
helpful okay perfect so you could just
 
03:53:16.229 --> 03:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
email it to the committee
 
03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:53:20.389 --> 03:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay thank you very
 
03:53:24.389 --> 03:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
much and we eagerly await that data
 
03:53:43.990 --> 03:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:46.710 --> 03:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is elsa croto i
 
03:53:48.710 --> 03:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
am a pharmacy compliant inspector for
 
03:53:48.720 --> 03:53:50.229 align:start position:0%

oplc
 
03:53:52.229 --> 03:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
i am here to offer my testimony in
 
03:53:55.830 --> 03:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
support of house bill 1444 regarding
 
03:53:58.229 --> 03:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
registration of med spas for new
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire statue rsa 318 a
 
03:54:03.429 --> 03:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire providers are subjected to
 
03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
a routine inspection performed by the
 
03:54:07.990 --> 03:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire water pharmacy inspector
 
03:54:09.830 --> 03:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
where legend drugs are involved for
 
03:54:12.870 --> 03:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
labeling storage safety and proper
 
03:54:14.710 --> 03:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
disposal of drugs
 
03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
through this routine inspection at
 
03:54:19.110 --> 03:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
messpars my colleagues and i discovered
 
03:54:21.910 --> 03:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
some very alarming unsafe practices that
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
would that could potentially cause harm
 
03:54:25.670 --> 03:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
to our patients
 
03:54:28.710 --> 03:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
most of you have heard of botox
 
03:54:30.870 --> 03:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
it comes in two indications one for
 
03:54:33.030 --> 03:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
medical therapeutic use and one for
 
03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
cosmetic use
 
03:54:37.750 --> 03:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
botox cosmetic is a neurotoxin
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
used to treat wrinkles crow's feet etc
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
it is an fda approved drugs
 
03:54:46.070 --> 03:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
for a single dose vial which have no
 
03:54:46.080 --> 03:54:47.990 align:start position:0%
for a single dose vial which have no
preservative

03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
preservative
 
03:54:50.389 --> 03:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
it can only be used for one patient at
 
03:54:52.950 --> 03:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
one time within one hour and discard the
 
03:54:55.750 --> 03:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
remaining however at most of these
 
03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
facilities it is being used as a
 
03:55:00.710 --> 03:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
multi-dose vial for multi-dose pace for
 
03:55:00.720 --> 03:55:01.670 align:start position:0%
multi-dose vial for multi-dose pace for
multiple

03:55:01.670 --> 03:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
03:55:03.349 --> 03:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
for multiple patients
 
03:55:04.950 --> 03:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
for multiple days
 
03:55:08.309 --> 03:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
or weeks or until it is gone
 
03:55:09.910 --> 03:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
this poses a great risk for
 
03:55:12.229 --> 03:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
contamination and can have deadly
 
03:55:14.469 --> 03:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
consequences in the eye of infectious
 
03:55:17.030 --> 03:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
disease according to the cdc
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
we also found iv hydration such as
 
03:55:22.870 --> 03:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
vitamins amino acid peptide drip being
 
03:55:25.750 --> 03:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
offered to patients at medspa as well
 
03:55:28.150 --> 03:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
there were little to no documentations
 
03:55:30.950 --> 03:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
on current training by the medical staff
 
03:55:34.469 --> 03:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
consistent consisting of mostly lpn
 
03:55:36.870 --> 03:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
which is a licensed nurse practitioner
 
03:55:36.880 --> 03:55:37.830 align:start position:0%
which is a licensed nurse practitioner
or

03:55:37.830 --> 03:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:55:41.030 --> 03:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
rn which is a licensed registered nurse
 
03:55:43.750 --> 03:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
on administration of botox
 
03:55:46.229 --> 03:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
no training on aseptic technique hand
 
03:55:49.990 --> 03:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
hygiene when handling iv admixture
 
03:55:51.990 --> 03:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
evidence every medication should be
 
03:55:54.389 --> 03:55:54.399 align:start position:0%
stored at a recommended temperature by
 
03:55:57.189 --> 03:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer however whether it is
 
03:55:59.830 --> 03:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
at room temperature in refrigeration or
 
03:56:01.990 --> 03:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
frozen and should be monitored and
 
03:56:04.229 --> 03:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
tracked regularly
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
if the temperature is out of range even
 
03:56:09.189 --> 03:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
for a small period of time this can
 
03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
interfere with the integrity of the
 
03:56:11.359 --> 03:56:12.710 align:start position:0%
interfere with the integrity of the
medication

03:56:12.710 --> 03:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
medication
 
03:56:14.710 --> 03:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
this practice was not in place at the
 
03:56:16.229 --> 03:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
majority atmos
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
of mess bar that we inspected
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
there were no crash boxes containing at
 
03:56:23.590 --> 03:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
least epipen
 
03:56:25.510 --> 03:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
or benadryl available
 
03:56:27.269 --> 03:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
at most of these facilities to be
 
03:56:27.279 --> 03:56:29.110 align:start position:0%
at most of these facilities to be

03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
administered
 
03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
should there be an anaphylaxis event
 
03:56:33.189 --> 03:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
that is when the patient have severe
 
03:56:38.309 --> 03:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:40.309 --> 03:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
i asked one of the provider that i
 
03:56:40.319 --> 03:56:41.510 align:start position:0%
i asked one of the provider that i
inspected

03:56:41.510 --> 03:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
what would she do in this unfortunate
 
03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
situation she replied quote i have to
 
03:56:49.590 --> 03:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
use my son's epipen in my purse i guess
 
03:56:49.600 --> 03:56:50.950 align:start position:0%
use my son's epipen in my purse i guess

illegal to use one specific one's
 
03:56:57.990 --> 03:56:58.000 align:start position:0%

the administration's
 
03:57:09.830 --> 03:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
botox cosmetic and iv hydration are
 
03:57:12.870 --> 03:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
mostly performed by lpn and rn and often
 
03:57:15.429 --> 03:57:15.439 align:start position:0%
without any medical director presence
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
such as mdnd aprn to assist or supervise
 
03:57:23.030 --> 03:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
while we are able to inspect the
 
03:57:25.189 --> 03:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
provider themselves but often the
 
03:57:29.030 --> 03:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
providers not own the mess bars
 
03:57:30.950 --> 03:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
accountability needs to be in place for
 
03:57:33.990 --> 03:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
both owner as well as providers and this
 
03:57:36.150 --> 03:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
can be done through seeking licensure
 
03:57:39.110 --> 03:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
from oplc this also gives us a broader
 
03:57:41.030 --> 03:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
authority to expand our inspection to
 
03:57:43.349 --> 03:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
ensure public safety
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
our patients place a great trust in our
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
healthcare system to protect them from
 
03:57:50.150 --> 03:57:50.160 align:start position:0%

practices
 
03:57:53.429 --> 03:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
and have the best interest at heart
 
03:57:56.070 --> 03:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
during every medical procedure we must
 
03:57:58.150 --> 03:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
do everything we can to protect our
 
03:58:00.389 --> 03:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
citizens and put their welfare above
 
03:58:03.110 --> 03:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
cost thank you
 
03:58:05.590 --> 03:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:58:07.510 --> 03:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
before representative schmidt raises his
 
03:58:09.189 --> 03:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
hand could you we have a copy of your
 
03:58:11.670 --> 03:58:11.680 align:start position:0%

03:58:14.229 --> 03:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
and i also have a question
 
03:58:15.269 --> 03:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
it sounds
 
03:58:17.670 --> 03:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
as though you are actually currently
 
03:58:20.950 --> 03:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
inspecting medical spas
 
03:58:23.269 --> 03:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
as part of the board of pharmacy is that
 
03:58:23.279 --> 03:58:25.030 align:start position:0%
as part of the board of pharmacy is that
correct

03:58:25.030 --> 03:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:58:27.349 --> 03:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
yes we only have the authority to
 
03:58:29.429 --> 03:58:29.439 align:start position:0%
inspect the provider not the mess by
 
03:58:29.439 --> 03:58:31.189 align:start position:0%
inspect the provider not the mess by
itself

03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
itself
 
03:58:33.910 --> 03:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
the provider being the pharmacist no the
 
03:58:36.870 --> 03:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
provider mean being meaning the the
 
03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%

representative pearsons but i'm not sure
 
03:58:52.870 --> 03:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
about that
 
03:58:54.309 --> 03:58:54.319 align:start position:0%

03:59:00.950 --> 03:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
other questions representative fellow
 
03:59:04.950 --> 03:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so based on your last response
 
03:59:09.830 --> 03:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
is is it correct if i assume that
 
03:59:14.229 --> 03:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
um all med spars are being um inspected
 
03:59:15.990 --> 03:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
now for at least
 
03:59:19.830 --> 03:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
um the pharmaceuticals because i'm
 
03:59:21.429 --> 03:59:21.439 align:start position:0%
you know i'm thinking that they probably
 
03:59:24.309 --> 03:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
all use botox right yes not all mess
 
03:59:27.670 --> 03:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
bars so far we inspected some
 
03:59:29.510 --> 03:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
that brought to our attention
 
03:59:33.189 --> 03:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
and um but our
 
03:59:36.229 --> 03:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
authority to inspect is very
 
03:59:39.349 --> 03:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
limited we only can inspect for farmers
 
03:59:40.550 --> 03:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know anything to do with drugs
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's my expertise
 
03:59:43.750 --> 03:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
03:59:45.269 --> 03:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
you know i don't have the authority or
 
03:59:48.630 --> 03:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:51.830 --> 03:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
so just follow up so you just have to
 
03:59:53.590 --> 03:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
help me because i don't understand this
 
03:59:55.910 --> 03:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
whole area all that well
 
03:59:55.920 --> 03:59:56.180 align:start position:0%
whole area all that well
so

03:59:56.180 --> 03:59:56.190 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:56.190 --> 03:59:57.590 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

03:59:57.590 --> 03:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:59:57.600 --> 03:59:58.630 align:start position:0%
[Music]
you

03:59:58.630 --> 03:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:59:58.640 --> 04:00:00.309 align:start position:0%
you
olpc

04:00:00.309 --> 04:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
olpc
 
04:00:02.550 --> 04:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
in specs or the board of medicine
 
04:00:04.870 --> 04:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
whoever somebody board of pharmacy
 
04:00:08.229 --> 04:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
inspects yes various medical facilities
 
04:00:10.229 --> 04:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the drugs are handled
 
04:00:12.870 --> 04:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
correctly as representative merchant
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
pointed out so does that mean that we
 
04:00:20.870 --> 04:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
would want to add med spas to the list
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
we could because they are a
 
04:00:25.590 --> 04:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
they they they are
 
04:00:25.600 --> 04:00:26.950 align:start position:0%
they they they are
doctors

04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
04:00:29.110 --> 04:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
facilities um
 
04:00:31.590 --> 04:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
once we define them in statute otherwise
 
04:00:34.389 --> 04:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
we don't have a number i believe that if
 
04:00:36.389 --> 04:00:36.399 align:start position:0%
they're a medical facility run by a
 
04:00:39.269 --> 04:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
doctor they ca that's one of the issues
 
04:00:40.870 --> 04:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
that the board of medicine has with the
 
04:00:42.790 --> 04:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
board of pharmacy
 
04:00:42.800 --> 04:00:43.910 align:start position:0%
board of pharmacy

thank you
 
04:00:47.110 --> 04:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
can i answer to that question
 
04:00:48.950 --> 04:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
so the board of pharmacy
 
04:00:51.510 --> 04:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
our inspector only can inspect the
 
04:00:55.349 --> 04:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
provider which is the nd the a the mdo
 
04:00:55.359 --> 04:00:58.950 align:start position:0%
provider which is the nd the a the mdo
apin

04:00:58.950 --> 04:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:58.960 --> 04:01:01.189 align:start position:0%
 
pa

04:01:01.189 --> 04:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
pa
 
04:01:04.469 --> 04:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
we do go out and inspect various doctors
 
04:01:04.479 --> 04:01:05.750 align:start position:0%
we do go out and inspect various doctors
offices

04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
offices
 
04:01:07.750 --> 04:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
only inspecting the provider we don't
 
04:01:09.429 --> 04:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
inspect the facility because they
 
04:01:11.030 --> 04:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
understand you they do not hold a
 
04:01:16.550 --> 04:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:23.830 --> 04:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:25.830 --> 04:01:25.840 align:start position:0%

hampshire as well as massachusetts
 
04:02:01.429 --> 04:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
my medical experience and expertise is
 
04:02:03.349 --> 04:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
vast as i have worked in multiple
 
04:02:05.429 --> 04:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
specialties including hospitalist
 
04:02:07.670 --> 04:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
medicine emergency medicine and critical
 
04:02:09.110 --> 04:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
care medicine
 
04:02:11.030 --> 04:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
in addition to hospital-based practice i
 
04:02:12.710 --> 04:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
was introduced to the field of aesthetic
 
04:02:15.030 --> 04:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
medicine over five years ago and have
 
04:02:17.429 --> 04:02:17.439 align:start position:0%
actively been pursuing my field in this
 
04:02:19.590 --> 04:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
and have actively been pursuing my
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
passion in this field
 
04:02:23.990 --> 04:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
i've worked for two separate practices
 
04:02:25.990 --> 04:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
and will be opening my own medical
 
04:02:27.510 --> 04:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
aesthetic practice within the next few
 
04:02:27.520 --> 04:02:28.630 align:start position:0%
aesthetic practice within the next few
months

04:02:28.630 --> 04:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
months
 
04:02:30.790 --> 04:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
medical aesthetics as mentioned by
 
04:02:32.710 --> 04:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
multiple other people today is a field
 
04:02:36.070 --> 04:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
that is often misunderstood
 
04:02:38.309 --> 04:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
i will kind of briefly we know that
 
04:02:39.830 --> 04:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
medical aesthetics does not just perform
 
04:02:42.309 --> 04:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
cosmetical procedures but multiple other
 
04:02:42.319 --> 04:02:43.429 align:start position:0%
cosmetical procedures but multiple other
special

04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
special
 
04:02:45.670 --> 04:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
specialties as as everyone mentioned
 
04:02:48.550 --> 04:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
including hormone supplementation
 
04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
different devices medical weight loss
 
04:02:52.790 --> 04:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
and it's really important to note that
 
04:02:55.830 --> 04:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
we are not hair stylists or estheticians
 
04:02:57.429 --> 04:02:57.439 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:02:59.510 --> 04:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
board certified medical practitioners
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%

04:03:09.590 --> 04:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
within the last year several medical
 
04:03:10.870 --> 04:03:10.880 align:start position:0%

04:03:13.110 --> 04:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire including myself have joined
 
04:03:13.120 --> 04:03:15.030 align:start position:0%
hampshire including myself have joined
forces

04:03:15.030 --> 04:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
forces
 
04:03:16.630 --> 04:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
to ensure that medical aesthetic has
 
04:03:18.469 --> 04:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate representation here in new
 
04:03:19.990 --> 04:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire and across all of our
 
04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
respective medical boards
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
as leaders in the field of medical
 
04:03:25.349 --> 04:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
aesthetics we have developed the
 
04:03:26.710 --> 04:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
aesthetic medical providers of new
 
04:03:28.150 --> 04:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire in an effort to promote
 
04:03:30.550 --> 04:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
practice standards which ensure safe
 
04:03:32.150 --> 04:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
patient-centered care
 
04:03:34.630 --> 04:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
review evidence-based research
 
04:03:36.710 --> 04:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
share updated laws and guidelines as
 
04:03:39.030 --> 04:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
they pertain to aesthetic providers in
 
04:03:41.030 --> 04:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and create a community
 
04:03:42.550 --> 04:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
that encourages collaborative and
 
04:03:45.670 --> 04:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
supportive efforts amongst its members
 
04:03:47.429 --> 04:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
on behalf of our organization i would
 
04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
like to share with you my concerns
 
04:03:51.269 --> 04:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
regarding the integrity of this bill
 
04:03:52.790 --> 04:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
as mentioned previously this bill
 
04:03:55.269 --> 04:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
falsely identifies medical spas as the
 
04:03:57.189 --> 04:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
only location where patients are seeking
 
04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
out cosmetic procedures
 
04:04:01.910 --> 04:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
multiple medical professionals and
 
04:04:03.990 --> 04:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
specialties perform are performing these
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
same procedures in their office
 
04:04:08.150 --> 04:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
including primary care offices
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
dermatology practices ent general
 
04:04:13.990 --> 04:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
surgery women's health ob gyn office and
 
04:04:15.750 --> 04:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
dental practices
 
04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
so why were they not included in this
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
bill as well
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
the bill will also enforce our practices
 
04:04:24.870 --> 04:04:24.880 align:start position:0%

to register mp fees which will fund the
specific

04:04:25.990 --> 04:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:04:28.309 --> 04:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
inspector to inspect us
 
04:04:30.630 --> 04:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
however this does seem redundant as we
 
04:04:31.990 --> 04:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
are subjective to review an
 
04:04:34.229 --> 04:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
investigation by our boards if in fact
 
04:04:36.150 --> 04:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
there was a something that needed to be
 
04:04:36.160 --> 04:04:37.189 align:start position:0%
there was a something that needed to be
inspected

04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
as well as the oplc
 
04:04:42.469 --> 04:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
again it's unclear why we were then
 
04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
focused when other
 
04:04:46.150 --> 04:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
practices that are performing these same
 
04:04:48.469 --> 04:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
procedures are not
 
04:04:50.870 --> 04:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
asked to do the same
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
medical aesthetics
 
04:04:54.710 --> 04:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
is not part of our initial didactic and
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
training in medicine or nursing practice
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
we see we must independently seek out
 
04:05:02.469 --> 04:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
and pay for advanced training personally
 
04:05:03.910 --> 04:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
i have traveled both nationally and
 
04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
internationally for training and have
 
04:05:07.750 --> 04:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
spent tens and tens of thousands of
 
04:05:10.229 --> 04:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
dollars in doing so i have even brought
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
ultrasound to my practice as a way to
 
04:05:14.229 --> 04:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
better assess vascular anatomy mitigate
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
risks and complications
 
04:05:18.150 --> 04:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
assist with pro
 
04:05:19.830 --> 04:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
proper diagnoses
 
04:05:19.840 --> 04:05:20.950 align:start position:0%
proper diagnoses
and

04:05:20.950 --> 04:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:22.710 --> 04:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
deal with complications if in fact they
 
04:05:22.720 --> 04:05:23.990 align:start position:0%
deal with complications if in fact they
arise

04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
arise
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
i agree that medical providers need to
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
be adequately trained to perform any and
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
all procedures including medical
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
aesthetic procedures
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
however training in medical aesthetics
 
04:05:35.429 --> 04:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
can come from multiple different forms
 
04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
and prior to the bill determining what
 
04:05:39.030 --> 04:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
is acceptable training this needs to be
 
04:05:40.710 --> 04:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
understood and reviewed by our
 
04:05:43.189 --> 04:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
respective medical boards
 
04:05:44.870 --> 04:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
additionally this bill chose not to
 
04:05:46.550 --> 04:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
include medical professionals including
 
04:05:49.830 --> 04:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
physicians assistants and dentists
 
04:05:51.189 --> 04:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
as well as it attempts to place
 
04:05:52.870 --> 04:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions on medical professionals
 
04:05:54.550 --> 04:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
preventing them from practicing to their
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
highest potential
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
next and most importantly this bill was
 
04:05:59.510 --> 04:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
created without any deeper insight or
 
04:06:00.790 --> 04:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
dialogue with medical aesthetic
 
04:06:02.950 --> 04:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
providers here in new hampshire and did
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
not include our respective boards in the
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
process and did not seek to understand
 
04:06:08.870 --> 04:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
the current issues in medical aesthetics
 
04:06:10.870 --> 04:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
prior to proposing this bill
 
04:06:13.030 --> 04:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
by no means do i sit here to refute the
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
need for guidelines and regulations in
 
04:06:16.950 --> 04:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
medical practice medical aesthetics
 
04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
included regulations and practice
 
04:06:20.469 --> 04:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
guidelines are needed to protect
 
04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
patients and to identify practice
 
04:06:23.830 --> 04:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
standards that clinicians should and
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
must abide by
 
04:06:26.950 --> 04:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
however regulation should not be
 
04:06:29.189 --> 04:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
dictated to a profession that is already
 
04:06:29.199 --> 04:06:30.469 align:start position:0%
dictated to a profession that is already
regulated

04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
04:06:32.469 --> 04:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
and certainly without collectively
 
04:06:34.870 --> 04:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
involving them in the process
 
04:06:37.110 --> 04:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
on behalf of our organization i thank
 
04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
you for your time and ask that the
 
04:06:41.110 --> 04:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
committee opposed this bill
 
04:06:43.030 --> 04:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
i would like to just quickly touch base
 
04:06:43.040 --> 04:06:43.830 align:start position:0%
i would like to just quickly touch base
on

04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
just to
 
04:06:47.110 --> 04:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
give a little bit of overview as to some
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
of our other people that had just spoke
 
04:06:52.229 --> 04:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
with regards to pharmacy and
 
04:06:53.670 --> 04:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
the way in which
 
04:06:56.790 --> 04:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
medication is used in medical aesthetics
 
04:06:58.870 --> 04:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
i would be more than happy to provide
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
the board with probably an over 20 page
 
04:07:03.429 --> 04:07:03.439 align:start position:0%
paper that i took the time to write to
 
04:07:05.910 --> 04:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
investigate the way in which
 
04:07:07.670 --> 04:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
not only medical aesthetic providers but
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
all medical providers use and administer
 
04:07:13.750 --> 04:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
neurotoxins including botox that have
 
04:07:13.760 --> 04:07:14.630 align:start position:0%
neurotoxins including botox that have
been

04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:07:17.349 --> 04:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
that has now become an exact an accepted
 
04:07:20.469 --> 04:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
form of practice in medicine physicians
 
04:07:22.229 --> 04:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners providers we use
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
medications off label all the time
 
04:07:28.710 --> 04:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines are used multi-use
 
04:07:28.720 --> 04:07:30.229 align:start position:0%
vaccines are used multi-use
and

04:07:30.229 --> 04:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:32.469 --> 04:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
i would like to argue that i feel that
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
it is basic learning in medicine that we
 
04:07:38.309 --> 04:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
learn aseptic technique
 
04:07:40.469 --> 04:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that we necessarily
 
04:07:43.030 --> 04:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
need to have a different training for
 
04:07:43.040 --> 04:07:46.070 align:start position:0%
need to have a different training for
this

04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's all
 
04:07:49.510 --> 04:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
that i have thank you very much
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
representative scitec would you mind
 
04:07:52.389 --> 04:07:52.399 align:start position:0%
repeating what
 
04:07:57.750 --> 04:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:59.590 --> 04:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
the aesthetic medical providers of new
 
04:08:01.269 --> 04:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire which is the organization we
 
04:08:01.279 --> 04:08:02.950 align:start position:0%
hampshire which is the organization we
created

04:08:02.950 --> 04:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
created
 
04:08:04.790 --> 04:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay that's straightforward enough other
 
04:08:04.800 --> 04:08:08.870 align:start position:0%
okay that's straightforward enough other
questions

04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:10.550 --> 04:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
04:08:14.950 --> 04:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:24.389 --> 04:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:08:27.030 --> 04:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
in that case i'll close the hearing
 
04:08:31.349 --> 04:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
and open the hearing on house bill 1429
 
04:08:36.389 --> 04:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%

rockingham 24 district 24.
 
04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
oplc asked me to submit house bill 1429
 
04:08:50.389 --> 04:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
regarding massage establishments
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
this committee has heard this bill heard
 
04:08:54.950 --> 04:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
this bill in 2019
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
and passed the house but it was part of
 
04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
the coveted cyclone when it reached the
 
04:08:59.279 --> 04:09:00.550 align:start position:0%
the coveted cyclone when it reached the
senate

04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
senate
 
04:09:02.309 --> 04:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
there was a concern at that time
 
04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
regarding law enforcement in previous
 
04:09:05.990 --> 04:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
hearings and we want to address this
 
04:09:06.000 --> 04:09:07.030 align:start position:0%
hearings and we want to address this
today

04:09:07.030 --> 04:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
this registration will allow oplc to do
 
04:09:11.670 --> 04:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
its work in addressing victim needs and
 
04:09:13.510 --> 04:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
educate businesses
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
so they can do their work in a safe
 
04:09:19.189 --> 04:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:20.710 --> 04:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there
 
04:09:20.720 --> 04:09:23.590 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there
questions

04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:26.950 --> 04:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i this question applies really to
 
04:09:32.149 --> 04:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
the other bill also
 
04:09:33.990 --> 04:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
no i i
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
we license individuals and they're
 
04:09:39.189 --> 04:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
subject to their scope of practice and
 
04:09:39.199 --> 04:09:40.229 align:start position:0%
subject to their scope of practice and
their

04:09:40.229 --> 04:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:09:43.110 --> 04:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
their boards their appropriate boards
 
04:09:45.110 --> 04:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
how do you inspect an establishment what
 
04:09:46.950 --> 04:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
do you do go in there the floor is dirty
 
04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
i mean exactly what does
 
04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
licensing and establishment mean as
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to the practitioners who are
 
04:09:56.550 --> 04:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
working there
 
04:09:58.790 --> 04:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
in this particular case it would be
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
establishing to make sure that
 
04:10:02.950 --> 04:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
04:10:04.229 --> 04:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the people that work
 
04:10:06.389 --> 04:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
there have the proper licenses that
 
04:10:08.790 --> 04:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
public health concerns are being
 
04:10:08.800 --> 04:10:10.550 align:start position:0%
public health concerns are being
addressed

04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
04:10:12.149 --> 04:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
and that the business is doing what it's
 
04:10:14.389 --> 04:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing
 
04:10:14.399 --> 04:10:18.630 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing
safely

04:10:18.630 --> 04:10:18.640 align:start position:0%

license currently nursing homes and

for massage establishments i did email
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
late this morning a copy of
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
our proposed testimony so what i'll do
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
is put this aside i can leave a hard
 
04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
copy here but i really want to highlight
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
what i call the critical features of
 
04:11:32.550 --> 04:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
this particular legislation
 
04:11:34.870 --> 04:11:34.880 align:start position:0%

scheme
 
04:11:38.550 --> 04:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
massage therapists require licensure but

the establishments hosting licensed
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
massage therapists do not
 
04:11:44.149 --> 04:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
the structure proposed by this
 
04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
legislation mirrors other establishments
 
04:11:48.229 --> 04:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
requiring licensure just as

the proposed legislation primarily
ensures

ensures
 
04:12:40.469 --> 04:12:40.479 align:start position:0%
that these these proactive inspections
 
04:12:42.229 --> 04:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
will help will allow inspectors to have
 
04:12:44.229 --> 04:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
flexibility to enter an establishment
 
04:12:46.790 --> 04:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of a routine inspection

that basic health safety

standards are in place
 
04:12:59.910 --> 04:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
one of the issues this bill also
 
04:13:02.469 --> 04:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
addresses and it's it is an issue in
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
this state is the unlicensed practice
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
unlicensed activity is a primary concern
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
inasmuch as an unlicensed practitioner
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
has not even met the minimum
 
04:13:14.710 --> 04:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
requirements for licensure set by any
 
04:13:16.070 --> 04:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
particular board
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
including sanitation and health
 
04:13:17.760 --> 04:13:19.429 align:start position:0%
including sanitation and health
requirements

04:13:19.429 --> 04:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:13:21.910 --> 04:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice erodes consumer
 
04:13:24.149 --> 04:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
confidence in the profession and harms
 
04:13:25.750 --> 04:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
the reputation of those professionals
 
04:13:27.429 --> 04:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
who have met the minimum standards
 
04:13:32.389 --> 04:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:34.630 --> 04:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:13:37.030 --> 04:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
by requiring establishment lights and we
 
04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
do distinguish establishment from the
 
04:13:40.469 --> 04:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
profession they are two separate
 
04:13:40.479 --> 04:13:42.229 align:start position:0%
profession they are two separate
licenses

04:13:42.229 --> 04:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
04:13:44.469 --> 04:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
but by requiring establishment licensure
 
04:13:46.469 --> 04:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
and authorizing unannounced inspections
 
04:13:49.030 --> 04:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
of massage therapy establishments
 
04:13:50.389 --> 04:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
inspectors will also be able to
 
04:13:52.630 --> 04:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
determine if practitioners are properly
 
04:13:55.030 --> 04:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
licensed and if not
 
04:13:57.189 --> 04:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
oplc will have the authority to remedy
 
04:13:59.670 --> 04:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
the situation in a proactive manner up
 
04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
to and including emergency suspension of
 
04:14:04.950 --> 04:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
the establishment license
 
04:14:06.630 --> 04:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
i can give you a couple of examples
 
04:14:09.030 --> 04:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
right now where we've had to intervene
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
on an emergency basis
 
04:14:13.510 --> 04:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
recently we did shut down
 
04:14:15.990 --> 04:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
two nail salons and while at first
 
04:14:17.510 --> 04:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
glance people may not take that
 
04:14:17.520 --> 04:14:19.189 align:start position:0%
glance people may not take that
seriously

04:14:19.189 --> 04:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
here were the concerns it was an
 
04:14:23.269 --> 04:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
independent random inspection on the
 
04:14:25.030 --> 04:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
southern portion of our border here in
 
04:14:26.229 --> 04:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:14:29.590 --> 04:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
one shop had no licensed employees they
 
04:14:30.870 --> 04:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
were open
 
04:14:33.269 --> 04:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
they were conducting business we found
 
04:14:35.590 --> 04:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
metal implements that still had dried
 
04:14:38.149 --> 04:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
skin and blood on them i'm not trying to
 
04:14:39.750 --> 04:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
be overly graphic but these are the
 
04:14:41.590 --> 04:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
things our inspectors are finding out
 
04:14:41.600 --> 04:14:42.389 align:start position:0%
things our inspectors are finding out
there

04:14:42.389 --> 04:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
and not one of these individuals was
 
04:14:46.550 --> 04:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
licensed they did have a license for the
 
04:14:46.560 --> 04:14:48.070 align:start position:0%
licensed they did have a license for the
establishment

04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
04:14:52.469 --> 04:14:52.479 align:start position:0%
so we used 541a under the emergency uh
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh procedures act
 
04:14:55.830 --> 04:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
well it's under 541 which is the
 
04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures act but we
 
04:15:01.189 --> 04:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
have the authority to emergently suspend
 
04:15:04.710 --> 04:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
the establishment's license we did that
 
04:15:04.720 --> 04:15:05.429 align:start position:0%
the establishment's license we did that
we

04:15:05.429 --> 04:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
were able to work with the owner to not
 
04:15:11.429 --> 04:15:11.439 align:start position:0%
only get those individuals licensed but
 
04:15:13.110 --> 04:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
also worked with the owner of these
 
04:15:14.790 --> 04:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
establishments to
 
04:15:16.950 --> 04:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
fall into place as far as health and
 
04:15:20.710 --> 04:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
safety concerns and sanitation
 
04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
so we did we we suspended them
 
04:15:25.750 --> 04:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
we also offer these licensees due
 
04:15:28.149 --> 04:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
process rights licensees are entitled to
 
04:15:30.870 --> 04:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
due process protections in this instance
 
04:15:32.550 --> 04:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
they they were
 
04:15:34.550 --> 04:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
mandated to have a hearing before the
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
licensure board within 10 working days
 
04:15:40.550 --> 04:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
so this way if if the problems had been
 
04:15:42.870 --> 04:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
fixed we could
 
04:15:45.830 --> 04:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
reopen the shop and in these instances
 
04:15:48.070 --> 04:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
it took about 30 to 45 days to get
 
04:15:50.149 --> 04:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
everybody licensed make sure that the
 
04:15:51.670 --> 04:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
health and safety standards were being
 
04:15:51.680 --> 04:15:52.469 align:start position:0%
health and safety standards were being
met

04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
met
 
04:15:54.950 --> 04:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
but ultimately the shops reopened our
 
04:15:57.110 --> 04:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
goal is not to close businesses it is to
 
04:15:58.830 --> 04:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
work with these
 
04:16:01.429 --> 04:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
licensees but as you can see
 
04:16:02.229 --> 04:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:16:04.070 --> 04:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
if we don't do have the ability to go in
 
04:16:06.070 --> 04:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
and inspect the establishment we're
 
04:16:07.830 --> 04:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
never going to find out whether people
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
are licensed or unlicensed and that is a
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
major issue as well as with massage
 
04:16:13.199 --> 04:16:18.550 align:start position:0%
major issue as well as with massage
establishments

04:16:18.550 --> 04:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:19.670 --> 04:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
i want to talk a little bit about the
 
04:16:22.309 --> 04:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities i have reached out and
 
04:16:24.309 --> 04:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
in fact municipalities reached out to me
 
04:16:25.910 --> 04:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
derry salem
 
04:16:27.269 --> 04:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
and others and i believe some may be
 
04:16:30.149 --> 04:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
here to testify today
 
04:16:33.110 --> 04:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
these unlicensed establishments
 
04:16:34.950 --> 04:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i say unlicensed
 
04:16:37.269 --> 04:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
through the board itself
 
04:16:40.469 --> 04:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
is a problem and i believe most of the
 
04:16:42.389 --> 04:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
cities and towns have ordinances that
 
04:16:44.309 --> 04:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
address them but they're not the same as
 
04:16:53.590 --> 04:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:56.149 --> 04:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
by creating the establishment licensure
 
04:16:58.870 --> 04:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
procedure here we do provide
 
04:17:01.429 --> 04:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
consumers with a predetermined agency
 
04:17:03.910 --> 04:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
where reports of alleged misconduct
 
04:17:05.590 --> 04:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
occurring in a shop or salon or
 
04:17:07.510 --> 04:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
establishment may be filed and
 
04:17:09.830 --> 04:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
investigated this allows for further
 
04:17:12.149 --> 04:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
consumer confidence and right now we do
 
04:17:14.149 --> 04:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
have a massage therapist board but as i
 
04:17:16.070 --> 04:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned by the time we get the
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
complaint we can't investigate a
 
04:17:20.710 --> 04:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
licensee until a complaint has been
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
filed whereas having an establishment
 
04:17:26.149 --> 04:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
license we can go in proactively and we
 
04:17:26.159 --> 04:17:27.030 align:start position:0%
license we can go in proactively and we
can

04:17:27.030 --> 04:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:17:30.389 --> 04:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
do inspections uh and and we would base
 
04:17:32.149 --> 04:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
it under the pharmaceut i'm sorry the
 
04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
board of cosmetology which would be
 
04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
minimum two two inspections per year in
 
04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
some instances we only get to do one per
 
04:17:46.710 --> 04:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:49.110 --> 04:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
i do want to address the issue about law
 
04:17:50.710 --> 04:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement and i know that there are
 
04:17:52.790 --> 04:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
some that are worried about this being a
 
04:17:54.870 --> 04:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
law this particular statute being used
 
04:17:56.790 --> 04:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
as a law enforcement tool
 
04:17:58.950 --> 04:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is many if not
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
most all boards and commissions under
 
04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
oplc already have the authority to
 
04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
report out to law enforcement
 
04:18:09.110 --> 04:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
04:18:10.710 --> 04:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
the case that i mentioned to you about
 
04:18:12.469 --> 04:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
the nail salons
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
we were able to reach out to the
 
04:18:16.870 --> 04:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
department of justice and one individual
 
04:18:18.630 --> 04:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
the actual owner of the shop is being
 
04:18:20.790 --> 04:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
prosecuted as are those who are
 
04:18:23.189 --> 04:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
operating unlicensed we already have the
 
04:18:24.630 --> 04:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
authority to reach out to law
 
04:18:27.110 --> 04:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement so this statute doesn't
 
04:18:28.870 --> 04:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
carve out anything special than what
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
we've already been doing with that
 
04:18:30.479 --> 04:18:31.670 align:start position:0%
we've already been doing with that
regard

04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
regard
 
04:18:33.830 --> 04:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
it just allows us to go in and conduct
 
04:18:36.070 --> 04:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
the proactive inspections this bill
 
04:18:38.070 --> 04:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
would also allow us to
 
04:18:39.910 --> 04:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
when we do conduct these inspections if
 
04:18:41.590 --> 04:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
we do
 
04:18:44.469 --> 04:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
spot evidence of any type of crime
 
04:18:46.149 --> 04:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
we could reach out to the local health
 
04:18:48.389 --> 04:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
department of the town we could reach
 
04:18:49.990 --> 04:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
out to the local police department and
 
04:18:51.429 --> 04:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
involve the new hampshire department of
 
04:18:51.439 --> 04:18:52.790 align:start position:0%
involve the new hampshire department of
justice

04:18:52.790 --> 04:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
justice
 
04:18:56.229 --> 04:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
as as needed so i do want to just i
 
04:18:58.950 --> 04:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to discuss that part of this bill
 
04:19:00.630 --> 04:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
this is not adding additional law
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:08.630 --> 04:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
i will tell you the inspectors that i
 
04:19:10.630 --> 04:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
work with take great pride in the
 
04:19:14.149 --> 04:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
education aspect of inspections there's
 
04:19:15.910 --> 04:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
there's kind of a three-step process the
 
04:19:17.670 --> 04:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
first is you want to educate if they're
 
04:19:20.149 --> 04:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
minor violations you want to go in you
 
04:19:22.070 --> 04:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
want to educate the owner or the
 
04:19:24.149 --> 04:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
licensee and you want to help them
 
04:19:26.309 --> 04:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
correct and remedy those situations
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
number two would be a disciplinary
 
04:19:29.750 --> 04:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
04:19:31.590 --> 04:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
health and sanitary violations for
 
04:19:31.600 --> 04:19:32.950 align:start position:0%
health and sanitary violations for
example

04:19:32.950 --> 04:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:19:35.189 --> 04:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
if they're numerous we have to address
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
those not only through education but we
 
04:19:36.960 --> 04:19:37.910 align:start position:0%
those not only through education but we
do

04:19:37.910 --> 04:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:19:37.920 --> 04:19:38.950 align:start position:0%
do
issue

04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:19:41.349 --> 04:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
violation points with board of
 
04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
cosmetology for example
 
04:19:45.189 --> 04:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
and they may be brought before our board
 
04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
for a hearing at which time we will be
 
04:19:49.110 --> 04:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
prosecuting them so there's a
 
04:19:50.790 --> 04:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
three-layer approach but the first
 
04:19:58.870 --> 04:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:00.149 --> 04:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
so again i don't i don't want to be
 
04:20:00.159 --> 04:20:01.269 align:start position:0%
so again i don't i don't want to be
repetitive

04:20:01.269 --> 04:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
repetitive
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
but we do support this
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
this particular bill for massage massage
 
04:20:05.680 --> 04:20:07.349 align:start position:0%
this particular bill for massage massage
establishments

04:20:07.349 --> 04:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
04:20:10.229 --> 04:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
again the licensees themselves are
 
04:20:12.870 --> 04:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
licensed but the establishments are not
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
and this just provides another layer of
 
04:20:17.750 --> 04:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
protection for consumer confidence
 
04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
protection of the public health safety
 
04:20:23.349 --> 04:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
and welfare but more importantly
 
04:20:25.830 --> 04:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
this also benefits those licensees who
 
04:20:28.229 --> 04:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
are who are working appropriately
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
and i'll take i'll be happy to take any
 
04:20:30.000 --> 04:20:31.349 align:start position:0%
and i'll take i'll be happy to take any
questions

04:20:31.349 --> 04:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:20:33.510 --> 04:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative scitec
 
04:20:35.750 --> 04:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh i have a couple of questions i'd like
 
04:20:37.990 --> 04:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
to ask you but the first is
 
04:20:44.070 --> 04:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:45.910 --> 04:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
that had two aspects first you said you
 
04:20:49.750 --> 04:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
went into a place uncer unlicensed and
 
04:20:49.760 --> 04:20:51.429 align:start position:0%
went into a place uncer unlicensed and
uh

04:20:51.429 --> 04:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:20:54.229 --> 04:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
you were you made the case that you
 
04:20:56.870 --> 04:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
tried to work with them they're now open
 
04:20:56.880 --> 04:20:57.670 align:start position:0%
tried to work with them they're now open
and

04:20:57.670 --> 04:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
then i heard a little later it sounds
 
04:21:01.030 --> 04:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
was it a different somebody else that's
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
been prosecuted
 
04:21:05.349 --> 04:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
no there's there's there's a couple of
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
different layers so that in that
 
04:21:09.750 --> 04:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
particular situation we worked with them
 
04:21:12.229 --> 04:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
to once again open but that does not
 
04:21:13.670 --> 04:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
prevent them from being criminally
 
04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for their actions um our goal
 
04:21:18.149 --> 04:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
was to ensure that if they were going to
 
04:21:20.469 --> 04:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
reopen that they did so following the
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
laws and rules but that did not excuse
 
04:21:26.469 --> 04:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
the criminality of their behavior
 
04:21:28.870 --> 04:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh i certainly appreciate that that
 
04:21:31.189 --> 04:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
you're this you're not the gestapo that
 
04:21:33.110 --> 04:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
you're trying to work make this work
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's you i don't know but i want good
 
04:21:38.070 --> 04:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
laws not necessarily good people my
 
04:21:39.670 --> 04:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
question is this
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh there's something very inconsistent
 
04:21:44.790 --> 04:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
here and i'm going to put this on the
 
04:21:44.800 --> 04:21:46.229 align:start position:0%
here and i'm going to put this on the
table

04:21:46.229 --> 04:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
table
 
04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a a lesser
 
04:21:54.229 --> 04:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
semi-medical sort of aspect that you go
 
04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
in and you inspect and you look at those
 
04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
but we don't go into dartmouth-hitchcock
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
we don't go into urgent cares who's
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
somehow they're too high class for that
 
04:22:04.950 --> 04:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
sort of thing
 
04:22:07.910 --> 04:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
right and where i'm going with this is
 
04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's almost disingenuous to say oh we're
 
04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
going to proactively do this nobody
 
04:22:15.670 --> 04:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
complains going in and say hey doc i
 
04:22:16.790 --> 04:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
don't think you're any good i'm going to
 
04:22:21.269 --> 04:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:23.990 --> 04:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing funny stuff and
 
04:22:26.149 --> 04:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
i can i can clarify and hopefully this
 
04:22:28.389 --> 04:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
will add some clarity
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
facilities and that's the term we use
 
04:22:32.469 --> 04:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
for hospitals or long-term care
 
04:22:34.790 --> 04:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
facilities are inspected under the
 
04:22:36.550 --> 04:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
facilities division of department of
 
04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
04:22:40.550 --> 04:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's a completely different
 
04:22:43.189 --> 04:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
branch and different operation than we
 
04:22:43.199 --> 04:22:44.630 align:start position:0%
branch and different operation than we
have

04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:22:46.630 --> 04:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
so there are inspections that do take
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
place of hospitals uh long-term care
 
04:22:51.990 --> 04:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
facilities and other medical providers
 
04:22:55.590 --> 04:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
um but those are not ones that we
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
regulate and our boards don't have
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
that would be the equivalent on their
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
scale of the establishment license
 
04:23:08.880 --> 04:23:11.750 align:start position:0%
scale of the establishment license
correct

04:23:11.750 --> 04:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions
 
04:23:16.070 --> 04:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
04:23:17.830 --> 04:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:23:17.840 --> 04:23:19.349 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

04:23:19.349 --> 04:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:20.870 --> 04:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
i'm comparing
 
04:23:22.149 --> 04:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
we we just
 
04:23:24.950 --> 04:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
we just heard another establishment
 
04:23:27.830 --> 04:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
licensing thing yes and i'm i'm a little
 
04:23:29.750 --> 04:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
puzzled that this one seems to feel the
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
necessity to include
 
04:23:33.510 --> 04:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
crimes of violence sexually related
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:42.309 --> 04:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
why the difference between the two
 
04:23:42.319 --> 04:23:43.429 align:start position:0%
why the difference between the two
well

04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:23:43.439 --> 04:23:44.229 align:start position:0%
well
it

04:23:44.229 --> 04:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:23:45.590 --> 04:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously those things wouldn't
 
04:23:49.030 --> 04:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
be good in a medical spa either
 
04:23:51.110 --> 04:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
no no sir but why do you feel like you
 
04:23:53.830 --> 04:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
have to actually put it in statute that
 
04:23:57.189 --> 04:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
this particular industry
 
04:23:58.710 --> 04:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
has this problem
 
04:24:01.030 --> 04:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
i i will tell you i mean i think that um
 
04:24:03.189 --> 04:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
is that fair
 
04:24:05.110 --> 04:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
i think i think it is fair and i can
 
04:24:07.110 --> 04:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
tell you that
 
04:24:09.429 --> 04:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
an unfortunate set of events does happen
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
in some some of these
 
04:24:13.510 --> 04:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
massage establishments which does
 
04:24:15.510 --> 04:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
involve human trafficking i am not an
 
04:24:17.670 --> 04:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
expert on human trafficking i have
 
04:24:19.590 --> 04:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
worked with the department of homeland
 
04:24:21.750 --> 04:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
security i've worked with local police
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
departments to discuss
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
human trafficking but i certainly
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
and i think that would be a fair
 
04:24:28.870 --> 04:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
question to bring them in at a
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
subcommittee level to discuss
 
04:24:33.670 --> 04:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
but it's unfortunate fact in reality
 
04:24:36.070 --> 04:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
that this does happen and i can tell you
 
04:24:38.309 --> 04:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
from an enforcement approach was as it
 
04:24:41.229 --> 04:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
pertains to human trafficking it is a
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
victim-centered approach
 
04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
it is to help the victim first
 
04:24:48.070 --> 04:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
and it's an unfortunate set of
 
04:24:50.229 --> 04:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances but this does happen in
 
04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
some of these establishments not all
 
04:24:55.590 --> 04:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:24:57.990 --> 04:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
04:25:00.309 --> 04:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh you mentioned
 
04:25:02.149 --> 04:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
in your testimony thank you sir for
 
04:25:03.670 --> 04:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question but you mentioned in
 
04:25:06.550 --> 04:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh working with the board
 
04:25:08.309 --> 04:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
of health and everything
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
so this will
 
04:25:11.910 --> 04:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
is my interpretation this bill will give
 
04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
you more authority to do these than to
 
04:25:17.189 --> 04:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
currently exist on the statute with the
 
04:25:19.269 --> 04:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
border health now
 
04:25:21.750 --> 04:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
in explain explaining it i come from
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
nashville we're very fortunate to have
 
04:25:26.710 --> 04:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
that ford but that doesn't exist
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
statewide in that caliber
 
04:25:31.830 --> 04:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
you're correct and and through the
 
04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh the local the the board of
 
04:25:36.790 --> 04:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
health in manchester for example nashua
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
other communities have been overwhelmed
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic
 
04:25:42.389 --> 04:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
and that's not to say they're not doing
 
04:25:44.149 --> 04:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
their job that they are
 
04:25:47.510 --> 04:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
but this does add a layer where it's
 
04:25:50.149 --> 04:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
more of a central repository
 
04:25:52.149 --> 04:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
where through these proactive
 
04:25:52.159 --> 04:25:53.510 align:start position:0%
where through these proactive
inspections

04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
04:25:55.830 --> 04:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
if we can if we can find
 
04:25:58.389 --> 04:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
issues earlier on we can make those
 
04:26:00.309 --> 04:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
reports out to like i said law
 
04:26:02.229 --> 04:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement or the health agencies that
 
04:26:03.910 --> 04:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
would be addressed in the rule writing
 
04:26:03.920 --> 04:26:06.149 align:start position:0%
would be addressed in the rule writing
process

04:26:06.149 --> 04:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:26:09.269 --> 04:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
and and it is really truly another it's
 
04:26:11.590 --> 04:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
another tool for for municipalities to
 
04:26:14.950 --> 04:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:17.510 --> 04:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
are there other questions
 
04:26:19.269 --> 04:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
yes representative judy yes thank you
 
04:26:20.469 --> 04:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
04:26:21.990 --> 04:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon sir
 
04:26:24.870 --> 04:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh i'm just curious during the
 
04:26:24.880 --> 04:26:26.309 align:start position:0%
uh i'm just curious during the
inspection

04:26:26.309 --> 04:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
04:26:30.790 --> 04:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
what do you call minor violation
 
04:26:32.469 --> 04:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
well that's a great question i think
 
04:26:33.750 --> 04:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's probably
 
04:26:35.590 --> 04:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
in the eyes of the beholder but
 
04:26:35.600 --> 04:26:37.189 align:start position:0%
in the eyes of the beholder but
oftentimes

04:26:37.189 --> 04:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
oftentimes
 
04:26:40.229 --> 04:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
improper display of licensure let's say
 
04:26:42.790 --> 04:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
in some shops you're required to
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
hang your license it may be instead
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
maybe in the back room instead of on on
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
the booth
 
04:26:50.149 --> 04:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
it could be something as much as maybe
 
04:26:52.309 --> 04:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
like in a cosmo inspection where they
 
04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
hadn't sweeped up the hair from the
 
04:26:55.590 --> 04:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
client before
 
04:26:57.670 --> 04:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
i would say that those constitute minor
 
04:27:00.070 --> 04:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
infractions the more major infractions
 
04:27:01.510 --> 04:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:27:03.429 --> 04:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
not using what's called the autoclave
 
04:27:05.189 --> 04:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
04:27:08.070 --> 04:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's the unit to disinfect and to
 
04:27:08.080 --> 04:27:09.990 align:start position:0%
it's the unit to disinfect and to
sanitize

04:27:09.990 --> 04:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
sanitize
 
04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
metal implements which are used to go
 
04:27:13.830 --> 04:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
under the fingernails
 
04:27:16.710 --> 04:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
if we find that those items have either
 
04:27:16.720 --> 04:27:17.590 align:start position:0%
if we find that those items have either
not

04:27:17.590 --> 04:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:27:19.750 --> 04:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
been properly sterilized
 
04:27:22.149 --> 04:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
or there are still
 
04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
bio potential biohazards on them that's
 
04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
a major um
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
the foot spas
 
04:27:29.990 --> 04:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
our inspectors go in and they actually
 
04:27:32.710 --> 04:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
lift the cover off what you see on on
 
04:27:34.149 --> 04:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
where you place your feet is nice and
 
04:27:36.229 --> 04:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
tidy what you don't see is what's
 
04:27:38.870 --> 04:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
covering the motor um and so our
 
04:27:42.070 --> 04:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
inspectors do these are very detailed
 
04:27:45.429 --> 04:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:45.439 --> 04:27:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
sure

04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:53.189 --> 04:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:55.030 --> 04:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr porter and thank you ma'am
 
04:27:56.870 --> 04:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
04:27:59.910 --> 04:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
so uh we have been uh participating in a
 
04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
little dance here of sorts uh so how
 
04:28:05.670 --> 04:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
many uh towns are currently
 
04:28:08.710 --> 04:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
afflicted with establishments which are
 
04:28:08.720 --> 04:28:09.830 align:start position:0%
afflicted with establishments which are
massage

04:28:09.830 --> 04:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
massage
 
04:28:11.830 --> 04:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
establishments where there's no
 
04:28:16.469 --> 04:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:18.149 --> 04:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
well that's a great question i mean
 
04:28:21.189 --> 04:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
nobody advertises criminality but
 
04:28:23.910 --> 04:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
i can tell you it's affecting
 
04:28:26.710 --> 04:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
from my experiences the southern
 
04:28:29.590 --> 04:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
southeastern tier of new hampshire but
 
04:28:31.910 --> 04:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
but i believe it's also encroached upon
 
04:28:33.269 --> 04:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
the central
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
portion of new hampshire and i think
 
04:28:35.750 --> 04:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
those members that are here from
 
04:28:37.510 --> 04:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities can better answer that
 
04:28:37.520 --> 04:28:39.110 align:start position:0%
municipalities can better answer that
question

04:28:39.110 --> 04:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:28:41.830 --> 04:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:44.630 --> 04:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:44.640 --> 04:28:45.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:28:45.670 --> 04:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
okay

04:29:20.870 --> 04:29:20.880 align:start position:0%

mr porter has pretty much summarized
 
04:29:30.720 --> 04:29:32.870 align:start position:0%
mr porter has pretty much summarized
everything

04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:29:35.349 --> 04:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
that i think needs to be said in the
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
sense of
 
04:29:39.990 --> 04:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
what the legislation is about
 
04:29:42.309 --> 04:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
so what i would like to do is read the
 
04:29:44.070 --> 04:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
letters that i have from different
 
04:29:44.080 --> 04:29:45.349 align:start position:0%
letters that i have from different
departments

04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
departments
 
04:29:47.510 --> 04:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you we have received those letters
 
04:29:49.750 --> 04:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
and we i believe everyone on the
 
04:29:51.990 --> 04:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee can read so
 
04:29:54.149 --> 04:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
just give us the highlights
 
04:29:56.070 --> 04:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
um well
 
04:29:58.469 --> 04:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
if that's the case then what i will do
 
04:30:00.229 --> 04:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
is this will be a little bit off the
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
i heard some of the questions being
 
04:30:06.389 --> 04:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
asked of
 
04:30:08.550 --> 04:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
what maybe some of the more specific
 
04:30:10.710 --> 04:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
issues are
 
04:30:12.870 --> 04:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
i think what we're seeing is there's two
 
04:30:15.429 --> 04:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
types of massage establishments
 
04:30:18.870 --> 04:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
some that are relative to
 
04:30:21.830 --> 04:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
like sports and rehab and medical issues
 
04:30:23.429 --> 04:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
that people are having
 
04:30:25.510 --> 04:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
after an injury those are more
 
04:30:27.910 --> 04:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic in nature the thing that
 
04:30:30.950 --> 04:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a spike in
 
04:30:33.750 --> 04:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
is on the side of
 
04:30:33.760 --> 04:30:35.110 align:start position:0%
is on the side of
what

04:30:35.110 --> 04:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:30:38.870 --> 04:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of people would term spa massage
 
04:30:41.349 --> 04:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
or just outright massage and and what we
 
04:30:43.990 --> 04:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
are seeing is a lot of turnover
 
04:30:46.469 --> 04:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
um in many cases less than a year where
 
04:30:48.149 --> 04:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
new people will come in and say that
 
04:30:49.910 --> 04:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
they're the owner
 
04:30:51.910 --> 04:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
and the place will change hands in some
 
04:30:55.269 --> 04:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
cases the landlords don't even know it
 
04:30:58.229 --> 04:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
and with that comes a flurry of activity
 
04:30:58.239 --> 04:30:59.590 align:start position:0%
and with that comes a flurry of activity
around

04:30:59.590 --> 04:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:31:02.550 --> 04:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
our change of use forms in producing
 
04:31:05.429 --> 04:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
secretary of state paperwork and id
 
04:31:08.550 --> 04:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
and information relative to
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
the fire department's requirements on
 
04:31:15.510 --> 04:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
emergency contact and that sort of thing
 
04:31:17.349 --> 04:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot of time to get those
 
04:31:18.870 --> 04:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
things straightened out
 
04:31:21.510 --> 04:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
in some cases those establishments are
 
04:31:23.670 --> 04:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
up and running in advertising before
 
04:31:25.030 --> 04:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
they've even been
 
04:31:28.710 --> 04:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
given their certificate of occupancy
 
04:31:30.550 --> 04:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
in some cases where we've gone in to
 
04:31:33.110 --> 04:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
deliver paperwork there is not a license
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
to be found
 
04:31:36.630 --> 04:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
and if there is a license sometimes
 
04:31:38.550 --> 04:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
there's no picture attached to it or the
 
04:31:40.630 --> 04:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
picture looks different than the person
 
04:31:43.100 --> 04:31:43.110 align:start position:0%
who is on the license
 
04:31:43.110 --> 04:31:45.110 align:start position:0%
who is on the license
[Music]

04:31:45.110 --> 04:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
this has been an issue there have been
 
04:31:50.630 --> 04:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
instances in instances where
 
04:31:52.710 --> 04:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
ice has come in to look at certain
 
04:31:52.720 --> 04:31:54.070 align:start position:0%
ice has come in to look at certain
establishments

04:31:54.070 --> 04:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
04:31:56.389 --> 04:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
and found that these there are people
 
04:31:57.910 --> 04:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
living there
 
04:32:00.870 --> 04:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
who shouldn't be and in some cases um in
 
04:32:03.750 --> 04:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
a very unhealthy situation
 
04:32:03.760 --> 04:32:04.790 align:start position:0%
a very unhealthy situation
we

04:32:04.790 --> 04:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:32:06.950 --> 04:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
are we're just seeing a lot of it and we
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't have any way of controlling it
 
04:32:11.429 --> 04:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
without specific
 
04:32:11.439 --> 04:32:14.229 align:start position:0%
without specific
complaints

04:32:14.229 --> 04:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
and so we're really looking for house
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
bill 1429 to provide
 
04:32:23.030 --> 04:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
some help in in the enforcement of
 
04:32:26.710 --> 04:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
the rules of the professional licensure
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
especially as those people transition
 
04:32:30.469 --> 04:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
into those shops
 
04:32:32.309 --> 04:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that the people that
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
are opening these shops are the actual
 
04:32:36.630 --> 04:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
licensed people that are working
 
04:32:38.950 --> 04:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
within the shops
 
04:32:41.910 --> 04:32:41.920 align:start position:0%

04:32:41.920 --> 04:32:43.590 align:start position:0%
we do see advertisements i think i sent
somebody

04:32:43.590 --> 04:32:43.600 align:start position:0%

to advertisements that i pulled up today
 
04:32:47.349 --> 04:32:47.359 align:start position:0%

headlines like new girls
 
04:32:58.790 --> 04:32:58.800 align:start position:0%

04:33:30.150 --> 04:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:32.551 --> 04:33:32.561 align:start position:0%

uh
 
04:33:37.990 --> 04:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
are we talking about establishments
 
04:33:39.990 --> 04:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
where uh
 
04:33:43.269 --> 04:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
trafficking is going on of employees and
 
04:33:43.279 --> 04:33:44.470 align:start position:0%
trafficking is going on of employees and
illegal

04:33:44.470 --> 04:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
activities are occurring in
 
04:33:47.760 --> 04:33:48.551 align:start position:0%
activities are occurring in
under

04:33:48.551 --> 04:33:48.561 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:33:50.709 --> 04:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
behind locked doors
 
04:33:53.189 --> 04:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
that is what we believe in at least five
 
04:33:55.990 --> 04:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
of the locations
 
04:33:56.000 --> 04:33:56.949 align:start position:0%
of the locations
yes

04:33:56.949 --> 04:33:56.959 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:33:59.590 --> 04:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:01.590 --> 04:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:34:03.910 --> 04:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
so if i understand you correctly you're
 
04:34:06.551 --> 04:34:06.561 align:start position:0%
asking for the state to help you come in
 
04:34:09.750 --> 04:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
and enforce your local ordinances
 
04:34:09.760 --> 04:34:10.709 align:start position:0%
and enforce your local ordinances
so

04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:10.719 --> 04:34:11.429 align:start position:0%
so
the

04:34:11.429 --> 04:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:34:12.629 --> 04:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
we we've had
 
04:34:15.189 --> 04:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
meetings with the state and with ice and
 
04:34:17.590 --> 04:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
with our detectives and health
 
04:34:19.429 --> 04:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
and code enforcement
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
and our problem is is if somebody
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
submits paperwork to the planning board
 
04:34:27.029 --> 04:34:27.039 align:start position:0%
under our change of use we can't deny
 
04:34:29.109 --> 04:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
them to open up a business so that's
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
step one
 
04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
step two is
 
04:34:34.629 --> 04:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
once we
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
04:34:38.390 --> 04:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
know what's going on without a formal
 
04:34:38.400 --> 04:34:39.990 align:start position:0%
know what's going on without a formal
complaint

04:34:39.990 --> 04:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
04:34:41.590 --> 04:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
there's no way for
 
04:34:44.470 --> 04:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
for anybody to go in there and inspect
 
04:34:46.869 --> 04:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
or to do a surprise visit there just is
 
04:34:49.990 --> 04:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
no mechanism for that to happen
 
04:34:50.000 --> 04:34:51.029 align:start position:0%
no mechanism for that to happen
um

04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:54.390 --> 04:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
and and so that's been that stymies us
 
04:34:57.189 --> 04:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
the only way so far that i'm aware of
 
04:34:59.510 --> 04:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
that we have been able to go in was when
 
04:35:01.349 --> 04:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
there were complaints
 
04:35:04.230 --> 04:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
and i believe they were irs related
 
04:35:05.910 --> 04:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
where ice came in
 
04:35:07.510 --> 04:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
and had our code enforcement and
 
04:35:10.150 --> 04:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
detectives go in on that scene and
 
04:35:12.869 --> 04:35:12.879 align:start position:0%
what was found there was people living
 
04:35:14.150 --> 04:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
in squalor
 
04:35:15.670 --> 04:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
we would not have known that because we
 
04:35:17.990 --> 04:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
can't go in and inspect and there is no
 
04:35:20.709 --> 04:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
mechanism for
 
04:35:22.390 --> 04:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
surprise inspection i guess you would
 
04:35:25.830 --> 04:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
say or state inspection
 
04:35:27.670 --> 04:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
so it's hard to correct those problems
 
04:35:31.029 --> 04:35:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:32.390 --> 04:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:35:33.910 --> 04:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
04:35:33.920 --> 04:35:36.551 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
committee

04:35:36.551 --> 04:35:36.561 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:35:39.670 --> 04:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you can can
 
04:35:41.670 --> 04:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
you just tell me a little more about the
 
04:35:41.680 --> 04:35:43.510 align:start position:0%
you just tell me a little more about the
planning

04:35:43.510 --> 04:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
planning
 
04:35:46.709 --> 04:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
board approval would would they have to
 
04:35:50.070 --> 04:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
obtain the establishment license before
 
04:35:52.551 --> 04:35:52.561 align:start position:0%
they open up or would it be
 
04:35:54.230 --> 04:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
they get planning board approval and
 
04:35:56.470 --> 04:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's conditional upon upon them getting
 
04:35:59.349 --> 04:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
a license how does that work
 
04:36:01.029 --> 04:36:01.039 align:start position:0%
so the way it's set up for every
 
04:36:03.429 --> 04:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
business right now is people fill out
 
04:36:05.029 --> 04:36:05.039 align:start position:0%
the change of use paperwork and we
 
04:36:05.039 --> 04:36:06.390 align:start position:0%
the change of use paperwork and we
require

04:36:06.390 --> 04:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
require
 
04:36:08.470 --> 04:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
a certificate of good standing from the
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office or
 
04:36:13.109 --> 04:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
paperwork that shows that they have
 
04:36:15.269 --> 04:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
indeed registered with the secretary of
 
04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
state's office
 
04:36:19.109 --> 04:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
and then for licensed professions we ask
 
04:36:20.070 --> 04:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
that they
 
04:36:22.150 --> 04:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
um for the owner or the manager whoever
 
04:36:24.310 --> 04:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
is going to be the person in charge
 
04:36:28.390 --> 04:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:31.269 --> 04:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of where it stops once
 
04:36:33.029 --> 04:36:33.039 align:start position:0%
once it's open
 
04:36:34.310 --> 04:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
that person
 
04:36:36.310 --> 04:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
may or may not be the one that's in
 
04:36:36.320 --> 04:36:40.551 align:start position:0%
may or may not be the one that's in
there

04:36:40.551 --> 04:36:40.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:43.590 --> 04:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
did i answer your question
 
04:36:44.830 --> 04:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up representing
 
04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
fellows yeah so
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
the license they show you is is the like
 
04:36:52.869 --> 04:36:52.879 align:start position:0%
the owner's license or the manager's
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
license and
 
04:36:56.070 --> 04:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
because i'm just wondering how they get
 
04:36:58.070 --> 04:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
a license for an establishment until
 
04:36:58.080 --> 04:36:58.830 align:start position:0%
a license for an establishment until
they're

04:36:58.830 --> 04:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:37:01.429 --> 04:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
there it's you know chicken and egg kind
 
04:37:02.551 --> 04:37:02.561 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
04:37:05.109 --> 04:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
well i would assume it's probably like a
 
04:37:07.750 --> 04:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
hairdresser you can be licensed and
 
04:37:07.760 --> 04:37:08.789 align:start position:0%
hairdresser you can be licensed and
switch

04:37:08.789 --> 04:37:08.799 align:start position:0%
switch
 
04:37:08.799 --> 04:37:10.310 align:start position:0%
switch
places

04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
places
 
04:37:12.390 --> 04:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
you can go from one salon to another and
 
04:37:15.189 --> 04:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
bring your license goes with you
 
04:37:17.189 --> 04:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
it would be probably be the individual
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
license of the manager or person in
 
04:37:21.750 --> 04:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
charge i would say
 
04:37:23.750 --> 04:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
but i'll go a little bit further so this
 
04:37:24.869 --> 04:37:24.879 align:start position:0%
might help
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
recently we had a licensed owner
 
04:37:31.590 --> 04:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
that opened over here
 
04:37:32.789 --> 04:37:32.799 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden that same
 
04:37:34.709 --> 04:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
person did paperwork and they opened
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
over here and both were they were
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
claiming that they were the person who
 
04:37:40.949 --> 04:37:40.959 align:start position:0%
would be the licensed person on site at
 
04:37:40.959 --> 04:37:41.830 align:start position:0%
would be the licensed person on site at
both

04:37:41.830 --> 04:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
both
 
04:37:41.840 --> 04:37:43.269 align:start position:0%
both
locations

04:37:43.269 --> 04:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
locations
 
04:37:44.869 --> 04:37:44.879 align:start position:0%
that became a whole
 
04:37:47.750 --> 04:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
paperwork trail and ended with somebody
 
04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
or them
 
04:37:48.879 --> 04:37:49.990 align:start position:0%
or them
selling

04:37:49.990 --> 04:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
selling
 
04:37:53.189 --> 04:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
their business to someone else
 
04:37:53.199 --> 04:37:54.949 align:start position:0%
their business to someone else
because

04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:37:57.990 --> 04:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
they were kind of forced to do that
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:01.510 --> 04:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
04:38:03.189 --> 04:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
version of scitec
 
04:38:05.349 --> 04:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
i'd like to follow up on the chair's
 
04:38:07.990 --> 04:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
line of questioning and i want you to
 
04:38:09.510 --> 04:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
know i'm going to take this very
 
04:38:12.629 --> 04:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
seriously since you're a constituent
 
04:38:15.029 --> 04:38:15.039 align:start position:0%
and that is this you said people living
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
in squalor
 
04:38:19.269 --> 04:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps prostitution human trafficking
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
living in squalor that there are people
 
04:38:23.670 --> 04:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
living in the retail space that violates
 
04:38:23.680 --> 04:38:24.949 align:start position:0%
living in the retail space that violates
zoning

04:38:24.949 --> 04:38:24.959 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
04:38:24.959 --> 04:38:26.470 align:start position:0%
zoning
prostitution

04:38:26.470 --> 04:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
prostitution
 
04:38:27.910 --> 04:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
human trafficking you don't need
 
04:38:29.910 --> 04:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
licensing this is like getting al capone
 
04:38:32.230 --> 04:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
for income tax evasion these are
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
criminal acts you don't need licensing
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
why don't the police go after this
 
04:38:41.269 --> 04:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
after the fact those issues were
 
04:38:43.349 --> 04:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
addressed but until
 
04:38:46.230 --> 04:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
we were made aware and probably
 
04:38:48.150 --> 04:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
bob mackie our code enforcement person
 
04:38:50.070 --> 04:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
is here as well probably better able to
 
04:38:52.310 --> 04:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
speak about that
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
but we can't do anything unless we're
 
04:38:57.910 --> 04:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
once we are aware then yes steps are
 
04:39:04.390 --> 04:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
taken and and that business did
 
04:39:06.390 --> 04:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
sell to another person
 
04:39:08.390 --> 04:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
that pretty much the very next week was
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:14.310 --> 04:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative schuett mongolia
 
04:39:16.230 --> 04:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879 align:start position:0%
perhaps this is more properly addressed
 
04:39:21.189 --> 04:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
to your enforcement person
 
04:39:21.199 --> 04:39:22.230 align:start position:0%
to your enforcement person
but

04:39:22.230 --> 04:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
would you not need probable cause before
 
04:39:26.230 --> 04:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
you could
 
04:39:28.150 --> 04:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
investigate whether there are people
 
04:39:34.869 --> 04:39:34.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:36.949 --> 04:39:36.959 align:start position:0%
please introduce yourself sir
 
04:39:40.070 --> 04:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i'm bob mackey with the
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
dairy code enforcement office
 
04:39:45.990 --> 04:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
so uh the question well probably
 
04:39:48.150 --> 04:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
just to back up a little bit on what
 
04:39:50.788 --> 04:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
beverly had said regarding and again our
 
04:39:53.430 --> 04:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
process is unique to derry so different
 
04:39:55.030 --> 04:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
towns have different
 
04:39:55.040 --> 04:39:56.390 align:start position:0%
towns have different
methods

04:39:56.390 --> 04:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
methods
 
04:39:58.868 --> 04:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
with the town of derry when you come in
 
04:40:00.948 --> 04:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
you are required as a new business any
 
04:40:02.628 --> 04:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
new business fills out what's called
 
04:40:04.628 --> 04:40:04.638 align:start position:0%
this change of use form
 
04:40:07.030 --> 04:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
and then part of that is and that's with
 
04:40:08.470 --> 04:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
the planning department and then what
 
04:40:10.868 --> 04:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
they need to do is then provide
 
04:40:13.110 --> 04:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
secretary of state information showing
 
04:40:15.430 --> 04:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
that they're registered as a business in
 
04:40:16.708 --> 04:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:40:19.590 --> 04:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
and then uh and so forth and then in the
 
04:40:21.910 --> 04:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
case of uh
 
04:40:23.830 --> 04:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the massage establishment typically
 
04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're looking for that initial license
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
and so forth something to keep in mind
 
04:40:29.670 --> 04:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
is the town of derry does not unlike
 
04:40:31.750 --> 04:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
some towns like i believe salem we don't
 
04:40:33.190 --> 04:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
have a separate
 
04:40:35.270 --> 04:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
ordinance regulating massage
 
04:40:35.280 --> 04:40:36.628 align:start position:0%
ordinance regulating massage
establishment

04:40:36.628 --> 04:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
04:40:39.190 --> 04:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
so as beverly had said once the initial
 
04:40:41.990 --> 04:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
paperwork's generated that's complete
 
04:40:44.550 --> 04:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
typically we do at that point code
 
04:40:46.470 --> 04:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the fire prevention
 
04:40:49.350 --> 04:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
office we go in we inspect we make sure
 
04:40:51.750 --> 04:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
that you know things look okay from a
 
04:40:54.868 --> 04:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
life safety standpoint
 
04:40:56.708 --> 04:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
if everything looks okay at that point
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
we do it then we do issue a certificate
 
04:41:00.868 --> 04:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
of occupancy
 
04:41:02.948 --> 04:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
but again at that point
 
04:41:05.110 --> 04:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
our authority pretty much ends because
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
we don't regulate them locally
 
04:41:10.470 --> 04:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
and again without some sort of complaint
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
or cause we don't have the authority to
 
04:41:16.470 --> 04:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
just go in on a routine and inspect
 
04:41:18.390 --> 04:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
so that's why i think this legislation
 
04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
would be critical so that if we could
 
04:41:23.110 --> 04:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
get the shops licensed that way giving
 
04:41:25.110 --> 04:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:41:27.590 --> 04:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh the ability to go in and routinely
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
inspect these or randomly inspect
 
04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
that would help out the town certainly
 
04:41:34.390 --> 04:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
to give us a better handle on exactly
 
04:41:36.788 --> 04:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
what's going on i mean because i've
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
witnessed on a couple of
 
04:41:40.948 --> 04:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
raids that i was involved with where you
 
04:41:43.030 --> 04:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
go in and you've got the second floor of
 
04:41:44.868 --> 04:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
these commercial buildings being
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
utilized for living space with literally
 
04:41:49.990 --> 04:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
buckets at the end of the beds for
 
04:41:52.390 --> 04:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
sanitation and so forth so
 
04:41:56.230 --> 04:41:56.240 align:start position:0%

04:44:34.868 --> 04:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
sole proprietors don't need an
 
04:44:37.350 --> 04:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
establishment license but
 
04:44:39.510 --> 04:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
in this section it says if a sole
 
04:44:41.190 --> 04:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
proprietor or
 
04:44:43.510 --> 04:44:43.520 align:start position:0%

appointment
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
the proprietor
 
04:44:52.470 --> 04:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:53.670 --> 04:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
like what
 
04:44:55.830 --> 04:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
i i can't i can't but i don't know if
 
04:44:58.150 --> 04:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative growth can i
 
04:44:59.830 --> 04:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to put this
 
04:44:59.840 --> 04:45:02.550 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to put this
into

04:45:02.550 --> 04:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
i just need to re-read it to make sure
 
04:45:07.590 --> 04:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
and and and on top of that that would be
 
04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
like a walk-in where you put up your
 
04:45:11.750 --> 04:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
sign you know
 
04:45:11.760 --> 04:45:13.670 align:start position:0%
sign you know
massage

04:45:13.670 --> 04:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
massage
 
04:45:16.390 --> 04:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
right now serving or whatever
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's how i would interpret i just i
 
04:45:19.590 --> 04:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
would have to take more time to digest
 
04:45:21.670 --> 04:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
that and get back to you because i need
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
to read it in totality with the rest of
 
04:45:25.510 --> 04:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
the statute and yeah i don't like to
 
04:45:27.590 --> 04:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
isolate too too much
 
04:45:30.310 --> 04:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
okay it just it just seems to you know
 
04:45:32.868 --> 04:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
at the beginning we have a definition of
 
04:45:34.310 --> 04:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
sole proprietor
 
04:45:36.390 --> 04:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
and it's in
 
04:45:37.510 --> 04:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
and they don't
 
04:45:39.990 --> 04:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
just it seems just seems odd to me i
 
04:45:42.550 --> 04:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
just wonder if you could some somebody
 
04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
needs to explain like why is that even
 
04:45:46.708 --> 04:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
there so that's all
 
04:45:49.270 --> 04:45:49.280 align:start position:0%

04:45:52.470 --> 04:45:52.480 align:start position:0%

public hearing

and i believe this will be going to
 
04:46:36.310 --> 04:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:37.910 --> 04:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
