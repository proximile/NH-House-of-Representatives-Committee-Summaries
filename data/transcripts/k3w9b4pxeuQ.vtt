and
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
dealing regularly with consumers that
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
are experiencing some of the issues that
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is designed to protect
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
the bill before us intends to better
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
protect consumers
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
from internet providers by explicitly
 
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.710 align:start position:0%
from internet providers by explicitly
providing

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
protections and requiring the attorney
 
00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:19.029 align:start position:0%
protections and requiring the attorney
to

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
investigate and prosecute cases of
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
internet providers
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
that experience prolonged outages and
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
internet providers that are
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
advertising speeds and then delivering
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
speeds that are below the um speed
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
that's advertised
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
i i want to give the committee a little
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
bit of background on how the consumer
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
protection bureau is currently
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
responding to some of these concerns
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
because they are concerns that um
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
i would say infrequently but
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
every once in a while come before the
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
consumer protection bureau
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
so we have a consumer complaint process
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
here in the consumer protection bureau
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
we have a hotline that is staffed by
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
volunteers that take complaints from the
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
public those complaints come in as an
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
official consumer complaint form that
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
then is reviewed by a paralegal and then
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
comes to my desk i personally review
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
every single complaint that comes into
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
this bureau
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
i review the complaint for potential
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
violations of rsa 358a
 
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.590 align:start position:0%
violations of rsa 358a
and

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
if i find that if true the consumer's
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
allegation would amount to new
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire's consumer protection act
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
i send it to the business for uh
 
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.910 align:start position:0%
i send it to the business for uh
response

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
response
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
so i said that you know we do on
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
occasion uh receive complaints from
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
consumers that are complaining
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
that their internet is not as fast as
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
being advertised by the company
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
we frequently send those to the business
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
and the business is always very
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
responsive to those complaints and
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
almost 100 of the time
 
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.389 align:start position:0%
almost 100 of the time
the

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
issue is not on the business side but is
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
being caused by something
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
um that interferes with the the speed of
 
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
the signal as it is sent from the
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
internet provider
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
either before or after it reaches the
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
consumer who's experiencing the slower
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
speed and as has been pointed out to to
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
our office on numerous occasions there
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
are an almost unlimited number of
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
factors that could cause an internet
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
speed at the point that it reaches the
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
consumer to be lower than the speed was
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
when it was initially
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
provided by the internet company those
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
factors include
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
the type of equipment that the consumer
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
is using
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
the the physical location of the
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
residence where the consumer is the
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
environmental factors that surround the
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
consumer um the strength of the signal
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
that is being received in a more remote
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
road location sometimes it's just not as
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
strong as it is in a more populated um
 
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.590 align:start position:0%
strong as it is in a more populated um
community

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
and various other factors including
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
things like the weather
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes can impact
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
internet speed as well as the number of
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
devices that are being used in a
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
consumer's home um if if a consumer has
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
you know a single modem for their
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
internet and they're only
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
on one device to stream movies um that
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
results in a very different internet
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
speed than if you know four tvs are
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
going at once as well as five cell
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
phones and you know teenagers who are
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
you know streaming online video games or
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
online music all day long those sorts of
 
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.110 align:start position:0%
online music all day long those sorts of
things

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
can slow down the internet speed at the
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
point that it is received by the
 
00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:28.630 align:start position:0%
point that it is received by the
consumer

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
in our efforts to make sure that the
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
slower speed is not the fault
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
of the business and is actually you know
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
something that's being caused by the
 
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.990 align:start position:0%
something that's being caused by the
consumer

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
the companies have been very responsive
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
and very willing to you know work with
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
the consumers in order to make sure that
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
they are receiving the speed at optimal
 
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.790 align:start position:0%
they are receiving the speed at optimal
levels

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
levels
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
but the way that this bill expands
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
this office's
 
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
requirement to both investigate and
 
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.389 align:start position:0%
requirement to both investigate and
prosecute

00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
prosecute
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
any case where an internet provider
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
speed is below the advertised speed
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
really creates two
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
significant issues for this office as
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
they see it um the the first one of
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
those is an issue of of resources
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
um the consumer protection bureau
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
has very limited resources and we make
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
the best of the resources we have
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
meaning that we
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know take the limited resources that
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
we have and we stretch them as far as we
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
possibly can to try to investigate
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
everything that we can on behalf of new
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire consumers
 
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.629 align:start position:0%
hampshire consumers
those

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:35.910 align:start position:0%
those
resources

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh i'm very comfortable saying are
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
currently either near or at maximum
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
capacity and simply are not designed to
 
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.590 align:start position:0%
capacity and simply are not designed to
be

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
expanded upon to begin a completely new
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
type and complex investigation which
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
would be required here
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
um so i just want to give the the
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
committee a realistic depiction of if
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
this bill were enacted and the
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
expectation is for the consumer
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
protection bureau every time there's a
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
complaint of a slower internet speed to
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
do a thorough investigation in order to
 
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
determine whether that slower speed is
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
the result of something on the
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
consumer's end or something on the
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
business's end
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
we do not currently have the resources
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
to do that type of thorough
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
investigation in every case so it would
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
require additional both attorney
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
paralegal and investigative resources in
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection bureau in order
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
to take that on
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
i want to be very candid though you know
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
if if the legislature were to give us
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
those resources to make this a priority
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
and say that you know we want the
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
consumer protection bureau to be
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
focusing on you know doing a thorough
 
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
investigation every time there is either
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
an internet outage or there is an
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
internet speed that appears to be less
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
than what is advertised
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
that is a very complex and um difficult
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
investigation to do for a number of
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
reasons and the reason is that none of
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
us here
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
are experts in the area of
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
internet speeds and internet technology
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
and how it all works um to the best of
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
my knowledge and through my interactions
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
with the various cable companies and
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
internet providers and just my knowledge
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
of internet um
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
something comes from the signal comes
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
from the internet provider and is sent
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
out and it's long based on current
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
consumer protection laws as long as at
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
the point it is leaving
 
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know the internet providers you know
 
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.870 align:start position:0%
you know the internet providers you know
signal

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
signal
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
initiating mechanism
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
at that point as long as it's at the
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
advertised speed um they would not be
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
violating current consumer protection
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
laws or this consumer protection law
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
we would need to prove at what point the
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
signal lost its strength
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
and doing that would be an incredibly
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
complex and potentially invasive process
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
that would require us to
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
prove that it was not something that was
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
the fault of the consumer this could
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
require us to
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
have to go into consumers homes to to
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
take their modems to test their modems
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
to see if the modem is causing the
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
interruption we would have to you know
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
do surveys of individuals homes to
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
determine how many devices they're using
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
are their devices at maximum caliber in
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
order to comport with
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
the services that the internet service
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
provider is providing
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
this is not an easy thing to do in fact
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know nobody in this building
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
currently has the knowledge base to do
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
that it would likely require us to
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
consult with experts
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
in the area of internet service
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
providers in order for us to just get an
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
understanding of how to begin to prove
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
that um this is something that is the
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
service provider's fault and not
 
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
something that is caused either by a
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
middleman or by conditions that are
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
caused by the consumers themselves
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
this is not an easy thing to do
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
we have received really good results in
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
our working with internet service
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
providers when consumers feel that their
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
internet is being provided at a speed
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
that is less than advertised um and i'd
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
like to point out that under consumer
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
protection laws
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
currently any unfair or deceptive act or
 
00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:10.150 align:start position:0%
currently any unfair or deceptive act or
practice

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
is a violation of new hampshire's
 
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
consumer protection laws so if you have
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
what this bill is designed to protect
 
00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:18.389 align:start position:0%
what this bill is designed to protect
against

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
is an internet service provider that
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
advertises you know it's 5g or really
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
fast internet speeds and that is
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
actually providing intentionally a speed
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
that is less than that um currently that
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
is a violation of 358a that would be an
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
unfair deceptive act or practice under
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
current new hampshire law and if that
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
were happening if we received you know a
 
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
tremendous number of complaints and also
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
that a certain internet provider
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
was actually providing internet at a
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
speed less than what they're advertised
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
we have the tools
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
already to you know
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
to bring that internet
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
provider into accountability for those
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
actions under the consumer protection
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
act it would be an unfair and deceptive
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
action practice
 
00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:02.870 align:start position:0%
action practice
but

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
by specifically taking
 
00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:06.069 align:start position:0%
by specifically taking
and

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
making it into a specific carve out
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
under 358a it's creating an expectation
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
that the consumer protection act is
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
going to do a thorough and complete
 
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.669 align:start position:0%
going to do a thorough and complete
investigation

00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
of each complaint that comes in on this
 
00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:18.949 align:start position:0%
of each complaint that comes in on this
matter

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
and i for the reasons previously stated
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
i i think that given the current makeup
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
of the consumer protection bureau and
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
the resources that it would take for us
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
to do that at the level that is
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
consistent with the work that we strive
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
to do here at the department of justice
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
it would be creating unf unreasonable
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
not an unrealistic expectation that we
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
would simply be able to investigate and
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
prosecute these cases like we do with
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
other unfair and deceptive acts or
 
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.110 align:start position:0%
other unfair and deceptive acts or
practices

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
practices
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
so i thank you all very much for your
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
time and your consideration of my
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning i'm happy to
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that anyone might
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
have we do have a question
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative weston has a question yes
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for your
 
00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
testimony this was very interesting i'm
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could men talk a little
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
bit about the outage problem because i
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
think we've all experienced periods when
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
we've not had access to the
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
to the internet at all and is there
 
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
anything that can be done when that's
 
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.190 align:start position:0%
anything that can be done when that's
prolonged

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
prolonged
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
so excellent question
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
the answer is unfortunately you know as
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
a lawyer we always end up giving this
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
answer and it's never satisfactory but
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
the answer always is when you're talking
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
about the law it depends
 
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.750 align:start position:0%
about the law it depends
um

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
in certain circumstances under current
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
consumer protection laws there would be
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
something that could be done about that
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
i'll give you two hypotheticals where
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
something could be done and worse if you
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't um if you had a internet
 
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
service provider that
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
has something on there
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
that malfunctions
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
or they experience a blown fuse or
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
something on their end
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
that causes an outrage
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
that's within their control
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
either they can fix it or they can
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
reimburse consumers for the time they're
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
not getting the internet
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
but they continue to charge people
 
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.789 align:start position:0%
but they continue to charge people
anyways

00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
we would absolutely take those
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
complaints as an unfair deceptive act of
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
practice and we would investigate it
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
however similar to the um to the
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
internet speed issue um as you know
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of external factors that
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
can cause power outages and internet
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
outages that are outside the control
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
of the companies themselves you know if
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
if there is a
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
if there were you know a serious storm
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
or an ice storm that you know knocked
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
out all the power in you know a certain
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
area of the state for you know a week
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
and you know it was 100
 
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
outside the control of the company
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
that would be much tougher certainly i
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
think that they there's an argument to
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
be made that it would be an unfair
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
deceptive act or practice for them to
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
continue to charge even though they
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
weren't providing any service because at
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
that point it's their decision to
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
continue to charge the customer that
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
would be potentially the unfair
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
deceptive act
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
versus you know something that happened
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
originally on their end that would
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
create you know some sort of culpability
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
but it all depends on the circumstances
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know the the overall point that i'm
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
trying to make is that either way
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
whether you're talking about internet
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
speeds or you're talking about an outage
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
in service for a prolonged period of
 
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.909 align:start position:0%
in service for a prolonged period of
time

00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
if the company is charging consumers in
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
a way that amounts to an unfair or
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
deceptive act of practice
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
that is already something that is
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
covered by our current consumer
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
protection act that we would have the
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
ability to investigate
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
presentation off with saying the ag's
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
office uses volunteers to
 
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.310 align:start position:0%
office uses volunteers to
um

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
collect consumer complaints
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%

tell us how they're trained and how
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
these where do you get these volunteers
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
to work in the aeg's office
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%

sure i'd be happy to thank you
so

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
we have volunteers that man are hotline
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
um by necessity because you know like i
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
said we we have a we want to provide to
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
the the citizens of the state of new
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire an opportunity where you know
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
five days a week they have the ability
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
to call into this office if they you
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
know believe that they have a legitimate
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
consumer complaint that we should know
 
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.710 align:start position:0%
consumer complaint that we should know
about

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
due to our limited staff resources we do
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
not have full-time or part-time attorney
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
general's staff that is able to serve
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
the role of being on the phone
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
um for five hours for seven and a half
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
hours a day in order to provide that
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
kind of service to the community so we
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
developed a system where we seek
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
volunteers from the community
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
that have to apply uh be vetted by this
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
office have to pass a background check
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
go through an interview process many of
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
them are retired folks that have an
 
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
interest in giving back to the community
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
um have an interest in helping people
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
and have an interest in supporting the
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
work of the office so they um they apply
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
they come in usually once one time a
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
week they man the phones for either a
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
day or a half day
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
we train them
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
we provide constant support to them
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the day
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
both the paralegals in the consumer
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
protection bureau as well as the
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys in the consumer protection
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
bureau so the volunteers are never on
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
their own any questions that they have
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
we support them and try to help them get
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
the best information to the consumer but
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
the volunteers role is really to assess
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
out whether somebody is calling about
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
is potentially a consumer protection act
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
violation that we should encourage them
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
to file a formal complaint for us to
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
investigate or whether they're calling
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
about something that is more appropriate
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
potentially for them to seek either a
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
private lawyer or to pursue it in small
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
claims court or something that would be
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
handled by another state agent for
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
example we frequently get
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
people that want to report uh parties
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
that are regulated by the banking
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
commission so the volunteers will assist
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
the person in making a complaint to the
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
banking commission
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
but our volunteers are you know
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately covet has really impacted
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know our volunteer situation we have
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
the fewest we've had in years um but we
 
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.789 align:start position:0%
the fewest we've had in years um but we
are

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
pushing through and you know doing our
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
best with the resources we have to
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
continue to provide excellent consumer
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
protection to the citizens of the state
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
our volunteers do a tremendous service
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
to this bureau we sincerely hope that at
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
the point that
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
life goes back to normal like we all
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
hope it will that all of them returned
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
and that we're able to have a full
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
lineup of volunteers again
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative you good morning and
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh you just
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
alluded to the covet situation i'm
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have found that the
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
volume and frequency of complaints
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
coming into your office has increased
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
now that we have youngsters working from
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
home business is actually being run out
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
of uh out of homes i'm working in a
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
study in my own home
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
our complaints have been consistently
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
going up through covid um and you know
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
it's tough to say what's causing it you
 
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.430 align:start position:0%
it's tough to say what's causing it you
know

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
the the great thing about having a
 
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.390 align:start position:0%
the the great thing about having a
hotline

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
hotline
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
is that it's a access point into the
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office for anybody
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
regardless of you know whether it's a
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
consumer protection issue or you know
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
they feel that somebody's not complying
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
with covert guidelines or you know
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
really anything that they want to call
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
in about we provide that access point
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
into the department of justice so we end
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
up fielding calls about pretty much
 
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.710 align:start position:0%
up fielding calls about pretty much
everything

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
that impacts all the state agencies and
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
all the areas of this office
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
we do receive a high number of covert
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
related complaints that we
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
for obvious reasons we're not receiving
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
they're not always directly on point as
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
violations of the consumer protection
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
act but we we do see
 
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.549 align:start position:0%
act but we we do see
um

00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic we have seen
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
complaints about various coven related
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
um scams and potential consumer
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
protection act violations that we were
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
not seeing before the pandemic so it has
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
caused our complaints our complaints to
 
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
steadily recruit
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
increase and i would say our calls and
 
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.430 align:start position:0%
increase and i would say our calls and
inquiries

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
inquiries
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
have substantially increased during the
 
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.430 align:start position:0%
have substantially increased during the
math

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
math
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
after that
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh the hyphen is just to my title uh my
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
you sir uh
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what uh would you be able
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
to tell us what uh percentage
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
of the complaints that you receive are
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
actually found
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
to have a
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
a basis
 
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:44.210 align:start position:0%
other than um
 
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.590 align:start position:0%
other than um
[Music]

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that you've discussed
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
which are not
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
actually the fault of the isp
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
are you asking specifically about
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
complaints against internet service
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
i definitely can't give you a percentage
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
i can say that
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the time
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
it is especially if you're talking about
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
internet speeds
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
it is something on the consumer end i
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
would say almost 100 of the time it is
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
we don't receive these complaints very
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
often so the
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
the great thing about having the
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
complaint process and the volunteer
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
process is that it's a great source of
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
information gathering so if you had a
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
company that was providing widespread
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
internet at below advertised rates
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
we would expect to see a significant
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
number of complaints coming into this
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
office because it would be a widespread
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
impact on the community
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
what we typically see is one or two
 
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:45.530 align:start position:0%
complaints come in
 
00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:47.350 align:start position:0%
complaints come in

[Music]
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
one or two a month one or two every two
 
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.390 align:start position:0%
one or two a month one or two every two
months

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
something something along those lines
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know obviously it deviates depending
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
on the month but that's what we tend to
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
see um somebody that you know
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
internet has been advertised as you know
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
high speed and you know sometimes it's
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
advertised as a certain speed and the
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
consumer feels that based on the
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
performance of their you know their
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
phones or their devices at home but the
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
internet is not living up to the speed
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
as advertised and we're every single
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
time able to get a response from the
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
business who is usually willing to work
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
with the consumer in order to
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
help them get their equipment up to
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
speed or to recommend optimal placement
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
of a device
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
inside of a residence or sometimes it's
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
simply a matter of just using too many
 
00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
devices at once
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire follow
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i may with one question
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
another question
 
00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.870 align:start position:0%
another question
uh

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
in the instances where you do have
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints about
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh alleged uh poor internet speed
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh would you be able to tell us um
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
what percentage uh just just roughly
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
approximate the percentage of the the
 
00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.830 align:start position:0%
approximate the percentage of the the
complainants

00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
complainants
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh did not first contact the internet
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
service provider for a resolution but
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
came directly to you
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh that's a good question i do not
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
believe that i have the ability to give
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
a meaningful answer to that we assume
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
that you ask
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
so we have a
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
we require all of our complaints to be
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
submitted on a
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
written consumer complaint form that we
 
00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:25.590 align:start position:0%
written consumer complaint form that we
have

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
drawn up where we you know very
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
strategically ask certain information
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
from the consumers one of the questions
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
is have you contacted the business to
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
resolve this um so
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
i i can't you know i've been in this
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
position for almost two years now i've
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
reduced thousands of complaints i i
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
can't give you a percentage i got what i
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
can say is some of them contact the
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
business first some of them reach out
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
directly to us
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
so can you characterize it
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
further question small percentage thank
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
00:28:53.919 --> 00:28:55.350 align:start position:0%
you sir
small

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
i i honestly can't i can't speak to it
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
without having had an opportunity to
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
review all of the complaints i'm just
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
not sure there's a lot of information on
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
every form i'm not always focused on
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
that i'm usually more focused on the
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
allegation that's being made because
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether a consumer reaches
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
out to the business first or reaches out
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
directly to us we always try to help and
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
try to facilitate a resolution so that
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
that particular piece of information is
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
not one of the most important things
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
that i review when looking at the
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
complaint form so i would have to look
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah so
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
i'll just try a couple for myself just
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
just to humor me uh so one time it was
 
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:37.390 align:start position:0%
an ice storm
 
00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:38.630 align:start position:0%
an ice storm
[Music]

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
and i can see the wire
 
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
hanging down
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
and it's right next to the pole and i'm
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
the only one on this pole otherwise they
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
run them on the wire all the way down to
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
my my house and the wire is hanging down
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh and so clearly they own the wire
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
they're responsible it would should i
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
have asked them for a refund for that
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
time that it took them two days to get
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
again you know
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
it's it's a difficult question if
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
if you had asked them for a refund i'd
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
be very interested in what their
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
response was
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
um and you know whether you know
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
it also comes down to the issue of you
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
know your poll was down you got to
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
imagine there were probably countless
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
other consumers
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
in this case it was just me but i'm sure
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
somebody else might have had problems
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
but but i could see that this problem
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
was was clearly
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
just me because the line came all i mean
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm a half a mile from uh the road
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
from the street well let me answer it
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
this way
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
if if there was a storm and
 
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.470 align:start position:0%
if if there was a storm and
your

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
your pole was impacted um your pulp is
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
maintained by an internet service
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
provider was impacted in a way that
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
compromised your ability to get internet
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
service you notify the company about it
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
they're aware of it and they choose to
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
continue charging you instead of making
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
it a priority fix
 
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
credit for the last two days i mean
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's a complaint that i would
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
certainly entertain um as an unfair
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
deceptive act of practice but you know
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
it comes down to
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
do they have the ability to fix it
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
quickly and if they're choosing not to
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
uh and continuing to charge you that's a
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
problem i i i'd say it's probably not
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
deceptive but it's certainly an unfair
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
action it was an ongoing type problem
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
right right in this case they fixed in a
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
couple of days and i'll say okay i want
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
two out of 30. i don't know what is it
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
you know that 15
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh discount or something for for the
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
lost days um but in another case
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
um they actually did send an email to
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
everybody and say that they did have a
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
problem with their internet where
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
they're sourcing okay because this is
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
i'm on one of these
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
rural rural programs
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
and they had their sourcing problem and
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
they switched over to a different
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
provider which they said they admitted
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
was slower
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
but that it was due to the fact that
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
they had a technical problem
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
um being able to hook up for that and
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
they never they give her credit but i
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
would have to say i never applied for it
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
because i feel sorry for them because
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
they're sort of you know running on true
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
strings and and they're not a big
 
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.950 align:start position:0%
strings and and they're not a big
corporation

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
but i would use this opportunity to let
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
everybody know a little bit about
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
wireless internet in their homes someone
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
who used to be in the computer retail
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
business so i uh you know if you my
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
email is prodigy which is the oldest
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
email address out there um
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
when you get your internet from provider
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
um whether whoever it is and they bring
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
you a router and some of these routers
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
have built-in wi-fi
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's the problem that built-in wi-fi
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
run wears out all wi-fi's get tired
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
and so you really do have to uh i mean i
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
think it's unfortunate the companies
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
don't let people know that but you do
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
really need to upgrade your wi-fi at
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
least every five years nothing else the
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
technology is faster and better
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
like we have this mesh now so you don't
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
even need wires but um but your wi-fi
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
actually does wear out so that's what
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
morning thank you
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
my name is lisa mccabe and i'm here on
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of ctia the trade association for
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
the wireless communications
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
industry in opposition to house bill 477
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
the wireless industry is competitive and
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
providers compete for consumers daily
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
wireless providers work with consumers
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
impacted by outages including providing
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
credits and other policies
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
to help customers remain loyal
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation would interfere with
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
that relationship by mandating a
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all approach to outages
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
many times outages are caused by the
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
loss of commercial power or backhaul
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
transport including fiber cuts that are
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
beyond the control of wireless providers
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
regarding the outages referred to in the
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
bill it's important to note that in a
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
wireless environment there may be many
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
reasons why our consumer may not be able
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
to receive service including an issue
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
with a handset or device which has
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the provision of the
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
service or that a consumer may be out of
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
a carrier's service area
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
providers monitor their networks for
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
outages and restore service as soon as
 
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.589 align:start position:0%
outages and restore service as soon as
possible

00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's also not possible for them to know
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
exactly which consumers are on the
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
network at the time of an outage the
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
very essence of wireless service is
 
00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:15.270 align:start position:0%
very essence of wireless service is
mobility

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
mobility
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
many additional provisions in the
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
legislation do not appear to be intended
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
for wireless isps as wireless providers
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
don't offer service directly to a
 
00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:25.190 align:start position:0%
don't offer service directly to a
residence

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
residence
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
and do not advertise download speeds as
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
contemplated in the bill and therefore
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to operationalize these
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
provisions in the wireless environment
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
wireless providers in new hampshire
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
including att t-mobile u.s cellular and
 
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.470 align:start position:0%
including att t-mobile u.s cellular and
verizon

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
verizon
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
are signatories to ctia's consumer code
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
for wireless service in which they've
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
committed to adhere to
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
industry principles including providing
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
ready access to customer service and
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
promptly responding to customer
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
inquiries and complaints including
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
complaints from
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
government agencies like the attorney
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
finally passage of hp 477 would run
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
contrary to federal law the
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
communications act provides that no
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
state or local government shall have any
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate the rates charged
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
by any commercial mobile service
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
mandating a price at which a carrier may
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
charge a customer in this case a price
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
of zero in certain instances is part of
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
the rate structure for wireless service
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
contracts and these would
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
bring new hampshire into conflict with
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
the competitive wireless marketplace
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
offers consumers choice and provides the
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate credits to consumers when
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
there are network outages for these
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
reasons we respectfully urge the
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
committee not to move forward with this
 
00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.430 align:start position:0%
committee not to move forward with this
bill

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from the committee
 
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.030 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from the committee
members

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much all right
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
attorney rosenberg you're back
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now we can hear you
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
great i'll tell you i'm having trouble
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
problems with teens with internet with
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
what you name it teresa rosenberger from
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
bernstein shurer i'm here today
 
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire telephone
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
association and opposition and i'm also
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
speaking for ellen scarpone of
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
consolidated in opposition who
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately her husband ended up in
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
the hospital this morning so i'm going
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
to speak for her as well
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
we all oppose the new hampshire
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
telephone association is made up of all
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
the landline telephone companies in the
 
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.390 align:start position:0%
the landline telephone companies in the
state

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
needless to say the the
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
main reason for the opposition is this
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
is an unregulated competitive industry
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
and let me say is one who ran fairpoint
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
communications there's absolutely no
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
question you want those outages fixed
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
and back up and running as quickly as
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
you can because of the competition you
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to lose even one
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
customer over an outage so it's
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
definitely to your advantage to get
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
those outages fixed as quickly as
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
possible it's also to europe
 
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.190 align:start position:0%
possible it's also to europe
to

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
give credits when when you can and
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
various companies give different credits
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
some people some companies give a
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
complete credit some people give credits
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
after 24 hours but the bottom line is
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
it's to all right then it's not to have
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
outages and we when we do fix them
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
quickly as to the second part of the
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
bill having to do with the monitoring
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the download speeds i
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
concur with absolutely everything
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh the attorney general's office said
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
attorney gerard he's absolutely right
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh it all
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
you can have the speed to the door but
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
you have no control over what happens
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
behind the door so therefore your speed
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
to the door may be one thing and your
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
speed on the other side of the door
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
depending on how many devices what brand
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
they are is something else so i did tell
 
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
everything he said and be happy to
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
answer questions and
 
00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:04.950 align:start position:0%
answer questions and
we

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
all want to keep our our customers happy
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's all i can say thank you
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
great thank you we do have a couple
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.790 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
uh

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.190 align:start position:0%
uh

nice to see you attorney rosenberger

to meet you too it'd be great to see you
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
downtown one day that's right it would
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
be um
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
just to disclose every to everybody um
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
theresa and i are both members of the
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
women's club of concord
 
00:40:35.359 --> 00:40:36.310 align:start position:0%
women's club of concord
um

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
we have heard this bill uh a number of
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
times as you heard
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things that has come
 
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.230 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things that has come
um

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna repeat part of what you said
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
the carriers that you deal with and we
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
heard from other carriers that they are
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
very happy to give
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
credits when people have been down
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
would you confirm that that the customer
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
has to ask for that credit they because
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
there are so many
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
um everybody's got internet
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
for the most part and there's really is
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
there no way
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
for the carriers to be able to tell
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
individual houses that might be down for
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
you know two hours three hours a day
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
but if the customer asks
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
refund um is it your understanding that
 
00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:28.870 align:start position:0%
refund um is it your understanding that
they

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
will give a credit um
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
pretty readily
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
yes it's my understanding if the
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
customer asks yes they will pretty
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
readily give the credit and also
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
represent bartlett it depends on the
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
company some of the smaller companies
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
are well aware when they've got an
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
outage and that it may be affecting
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
their entire service area or portion of
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
it so for them in many cases the
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
customer doesn't have to ask um so it it
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
depends it totally this thing is so
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
fluid and flexible it totally depends on
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
the outage uh but yes if a customer asks
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the companies
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
will give a credit
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
thanks very much you're welcome thank
 
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.750 align:start position:0%
thanks very much you're welcome thank
you

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative abramson
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh why not simply
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
create uh a cause of action for the
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
consumer or for businesses that are
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
facing an outage
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
and then uh if they're able to gather
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
the evidence on their end then then they
 
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
could take it to small claims court
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
if they had to
 
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
gosh and i think that's more of a
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
question for the attorney general's
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
office i'm not so sure i understand the
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
question because in most cases with the
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
outage the are you talking about the
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
credit because in most cases if you ask
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh actually
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
technically what he did say
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
was that it could uh you know if you're
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
falsely advertising speeds um it is a
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
violation of the consumer protection act
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
and uh representative abramson i know
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
you're new to the committee uh yes you
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
have the right of trip uh suing them and
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
you can get triple damages under the
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
right fair enough
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
i do know
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
abramson i had the issue myself this
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
summer when my daughter was here and we
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
had one speed advertised and we
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
certainly weren't getting the speeds and
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
so when they came to the house there was
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely no question the speed was
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
coming to the house but once it got
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
inside we were running i hate to tell
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
you four computers three cell phones we
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
wish my daughter was streaming the whole
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
time so the minute she left and went
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
back to cambridge needless to say our
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
speeds went back up
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
right but it's time for you to get a new
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
wi-fi inside your house
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
you are right you need to upgrade your
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
wi-fi every five years people don't
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
realize that they wear out they do
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna go tell my husband that right
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
now and i should have known that
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative hunt and i and i have
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
multiple they have eros eros at

one house and orbee
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
and another one and the mesh is great
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
you can have units all through the house
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to worry about wires
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful
 
00:44:17.599 --> 00:44:20.309 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful
okay

00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%

somewhat lengthy written testimony and i

know you have a hearing coming up at 9
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
45 so i'll be very brief and just try to
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
fill in the holes a little bit
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
my name is chris hodgston i am
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
comcast vice president of government
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
affairs here in new hampshire and i also
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
serve as the company's liaison to the
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
state's emergency management system so
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
i'm intimately engaged in
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
any uh outage related issue whether it's
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
storm damage
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh damage caused by
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
impacts to our network or the occasional
 
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
equipment failure
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
i just want to confirm for the committee
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
that in our case and in the case of all
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
cable providers in new hampshire that
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
our policy continues to be as it was
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
when this bill was heard in past years
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
to provide credits when customers
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
contact us and express a concern about
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
an outage or service quality or whatever
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
it may be
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
we we believe
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
that that policy is the right policy it
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
serves customers well
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
and the the type of regulatory regime
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
described in this bill
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
is is not necessary
 
00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.470 align:start position:0%
is is not necessary
um

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
the bill as other
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
folks have noted the bill
 
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
addresses this concept of speeds and and
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
advertised fees in a way that's
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
different from past pieces of
 
00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:22.950 align:start position:0%
different from past pieces of
legislation

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
so i thought i might just
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
build a bid on attorney gerard's
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
comments by
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
highlighting really one of the most
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
common factors that we see
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
when customers express the concern about
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
the down low speeds that they have and
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
these devices i in preparation for this
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
hearing i
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
did a speed test over my wi-fi
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
connection at home over this ipad 4
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.990 align:start position:0%
which is
only

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps five or six years old there are
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of these out there
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the marketplace and consumers use
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
them every day
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
and due to the hardware limitations of
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
the device the maximum speed i could
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
achieve was around 8 megabits down by
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
around 8 megabits up and
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
at the same
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
well moments later i did the same speed
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
test over the same wi-fi
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh device that i'm using to speak with
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
you today which is virtually brand new
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
apple ipad and i got the 380 megabits
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
down by about 19 megabits up which is in
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
line with the level of service that that
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
i received from my isp which is my
 
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.349 align:start position:0%
i received from my isp which is my
employer

00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
employer
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that just highlights really
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
the challenges that attorney gerard
 
00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned um i'll just
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
close by offering to answer questions
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
about outages answer questions about
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
speeds i i would ask the members of the
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
committee to take a peek at my
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
much more lengthy testimony i
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
in particular i highlight
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
independent data collected by the fcc on
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
a range of isps
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
and what they found when they
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
examine download and upload speeds over
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
the course of now nearly a decade and
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
that data really does consistently show
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
that isps are providing at the gateway
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
which in our case is the modems in our
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
customers homes the speeds that that
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
we're advertising
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
and uh it is not the most
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
engaging reading but if you're
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
interested in the technical challenges
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
that isps experience and what in a real
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
world environment the fcc has found it's
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's very um interesting and useful so
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
with that i'll i'll just conclude we
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
would ask the committee not recommend
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
this for passage
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
we do oppose it and be happy to answer
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
i see no questions for the committee
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
members so i think i think everybody
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
has got their arms around this one all
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
right thank you sir
 
00:48:55.359 --> 00:48:56.230 align:start position:0%
right thank you sir
okay

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh seeing no more questions and no more
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
attendees with their hands up and
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
everyone want to speak we will close the
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
on house bill 477 and we had 16 in
 
00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.390 align:start position:0%
on house bill 477 and we had 16 in
support

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
11 opposed and one neutral
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
so with that i will close the public
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
hearing and we're right on time to our
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
sort on time open up our next one
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 553 prohibiting renewal of
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
certain consumer contracts without
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
express written notice to the consumers
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
so i'll ask everyone who wants to speak
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
and the sponsor

do i see ben
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
this is terrible
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
we're having a bad day here
 
00:49:49.839 --> 00:49:52.710 align:start position:0%
we're having a bad day here
um

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
oh you gotta be kidding me
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm glad to introduce it okay yes
 
00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.349 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm glad to introduce it okay yes
great

00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:49:59.359 --> 00:50:00.390 align:start position:0%
great
okay

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.430 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.390 align:start position:0%
um
sure

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.069 align:start position:0%
sure
um

00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
the i'm i'm obviously stepping in last
 
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.829 align:start position:0%
the i'm i'm obviously stepping in last
second

00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 553
 
00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.549 align:start position:0%
house bill 553
um

00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
it would this bill would make it a
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
violation of the consumer protection act
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
for a contract for services to include
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
an automatic renewal provision that does
 
00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:20.559 align:start position:0%
not require written acceptance of the
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
additional term of service by the
 
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.150 align:start position:0%
additional term of service by the
consumer

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.589 align:start position:0%
consumer
um

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
interesting bill i
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
um happened to get a confirmation um
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
this weekend i
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
um signed up for a
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
national geographic for kids
 
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.430 align:start position:0%
national geographic for kids
subscription

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
subscription
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh for my grandson
 
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.390 align:start position:0%
uh for my grandson
and

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
in the confirmation
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
it says and you have been signed up
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
automatically unless you tell us
 
00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:48.630 align:start position:0%
automatically unless you tell us
otherwise

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
subscription subscription indefinitely
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking that this may apply to
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
something like that and i'm not sure how
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
it would be enforced
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
um but there we go i'm sure we'll hear
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.839 --> 00:51:08.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative abel has a question or
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett are you aware
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
that this committee in 2015
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
passed a bill that the house passed
 
00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:29.910 align:start position:0%
passed a bill that the house passed
that

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
applied this to health clubs in new
 
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.150 align:start position:0%
applied this to health clubs in new
hampshire

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
so there is a pressure
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
so it only applies
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
the bill that's in the law that's in
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
place now only applies to health clubs
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
that bill it only applied to health
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
clubs that's correct oh well it's
 
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
someone who was around in the health
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
club issue under 23 say 2015 that seemed
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
a little later because originally the
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
the issue over health clubs was
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
um they were selling lifetime
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
memberships a thousand dollar lifetime
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
membership and they were going out of
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
business in a year
 
00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.270 align:start position:0%
business in a year
and

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
um so we actually we had a bill in the
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh that and this is way back
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
this is i mean this is this is way way
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
way back oh you're not that old mr chair
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
um i'm trying to remember the name of
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
the attorney general but he's long uh of
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
the uh who was a consumer uh walter uh
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
maroony uh he's
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
anyway the issue uh that we had changed
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
that um there was
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
that they can only take a month to month
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
and they hit your credit card every
 
00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.150 align:start position:0%
and they hit your credit card every
month

00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
and that they could not uh do that so
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
the question i guess it sounds like
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
there was a the bill came back in
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh was that okay do do when it when that
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
period of time sometime or something
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
that they would have to notify you
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
to uh renew so i assume that's what
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
you're talking about rich is that they
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
that if they're going to if you know
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
some period of time that they have to
 
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.750 align:start position:0%
some period of time that they have to
renew

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
renew
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
so i don't quite remember that
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
legislation but that could be true but
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
i would say that
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
when i one of my my credit cards that i
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
used to pay all my recurring
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
bills with uh when the card expired
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
they all started sending me notices and
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
say hey your card you have on file is
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
going to expire do you do you have the
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
new expiration date so they they are
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
some of them are very proactive in doing
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
that but um
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
in general it is a problem that a lot of
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
these you know entities say they say you
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
can join for free
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
right but you got to give them a credit
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
card number and if you don't call up and
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
cancel it they will start hitting your
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
card and they'll just keep hitting your
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
card forever you know forever and ever
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
until until the expiration date and then
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
they'll rescue you
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
that works for easy pass too
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
an easy pass there you go
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay i wonder if that would apply to
 
00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.150 align:start position:0%
okay i wonder if that would apply to
this

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
yeah i i
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is written it it's any
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
any any anybody who uh
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
has what what we call a recurring
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
revenue contract uh which is a very
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
lucrative way to do business is
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
recurring revenue
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
and um and and but yeah they're they're
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
sticking right into 358a they're right
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
right into the consumer protection
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
statute so
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
i have one person and kyle
 
00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.549 align:start position:0%

thank you i will be very brief my name
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
is kyle baker and i'm here today on
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
behalf of the internet coalition in
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 553
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
um you should all be in receipt of a
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
letter of opposition from the internet
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
coalition and other industry groups so
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
i'll just quickly
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
touch a couple of the main points
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
of our opposition um concerns um this
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
bill would create an unnecessarily
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
burdensome process for consumers and
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
businesses offering auto renewal
 
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.309 align:start position:0%
businesses offering auto renewal
services

00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
consumers in new hampshire would
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
essentially be unable to participate in
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
auto renewal programs and would be
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
required to keep opting back into
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
services possibly dealing with
 
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:24.710 align:start position:0%
services possibly dealing with
disruptions

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
disruptions
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
in their service if they forgot to opt
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
back into a service they regularly use
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
companies are already obtaining member
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
companies are already obtaining
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
affirmative customer consent for
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
automatic renewals and other material
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
it's done in a clear and conspicuous way
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
at the time the customer signs up for
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
the service and this you know we see
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
that this gives the customers the option
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
to conveniently continue the service
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
without the need to take further action
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
unless um they would like to make
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
changes to their service or end the
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
service um
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
and finally we just wanted to clarify it
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
was already brought up about this being
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
generally in addition to 358 a um that
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
this bill would place new hampshire
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
businesses at a competitive disadvantage
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
with bordering states which you do not
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
subject companies to similar mandates um
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
it will place a burden on small
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
businesses who need to develop and
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
implement a
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
some sort of contract tracking
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
and opt-in system um just for their new
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire customers
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
so with that we'll let our written
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
testimony speak for itself i'm happy to
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
attempt to answer any questions and
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
okay any questions for
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
mr baker
 
00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.349 align:start position:0%
mr baker
none

00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
none
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
oh here we go represent van gaal
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
thank you i was just delayed entry into
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
that i apologize um my aunt died fairly
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
recently several months ago
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
and when her her daughter was going
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
through the estate she found that
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
several recurring charges to her credit
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
card continued after her death
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
how would this bill address that or
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
would it address that or what other
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
concerns do we have making this bill
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
cover eventualities like that because as
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
far as i know we will all die
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
sure uh thank you representative for the
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
question i'm certainly not a technical
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
expert on the various um ways that
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
platforms do their
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
cancellation and notification processes
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
but i'd be happy to follow up with you
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
after the hearing with the information
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
on how our members choose to inform and
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
work with their customers to end their
 
00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:32.390 align:start position:0%
work with their customers to end their
services

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you could you just give me a
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
general response to that um
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
is this something that the executor of
 
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
the rest estate typically informs
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
business of i guess i'm really not sure
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
what my question is but uh
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
theoretically you could be billed for a
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
great length of time after death uh
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that um
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
that you're dead
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
sure thank you again i don't want to
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
give you the any incorrect information
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
um on how the process works so i will i
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
will get that to you
 
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.710 align:start position:0%
will get that to you
today

00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative terry
 
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.349 align:start position:0%
representative terry
uh

00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
now i have two items mr chairman first
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
two uh if i may uh address miss van
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
houn's question i served as the executor
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
for both my mother and my father's
 
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.789 align:start position:0%
for both my mother and my father's
estates

00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
estates
 
00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:23.670 align:start position:0%
estates
and

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
when i notified the of the providers
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
that my parents had died
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
they immediately removed the charges
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
on the basis of
 
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
her death and um as of the date of her
 
00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:38.390 align:start position:0%
her death and um as of the date of her
death

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
death
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
or his death
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
so that that was not an issue a second
 
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
mr czech could i ask
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
that when we have lobbyists who are
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
giving testimony that they not only
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
indicate to us
 
00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:54.549 align:start position:0%
indicate to us
uh

00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
who they represent but also what state
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
they're located in
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
um i think this would be i know we
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
receive correspondence from the from the
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
lobbyists but i think this would be a
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
particular interest to to members of the
 
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.150 align:start position:0%
particular interest to to members of the
public

00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
who do not know for example where the
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
internet coalition is located
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
so mr baker can you tell us a little
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
about who the internet coalition is and
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
sure awesome new hampshire so i am a
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh lobbyist with rip granite strategies
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
so just one block down from the state
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
house the internet coalition is a trade
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
association that represents internet and
 
00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:40.870 align:start position:0%
association that represents internet and
e-commerce

00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
e-commerce
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
um organizations and i believe they are
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
and kyle you actually used to have a job
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
in the state house i did yes for a
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
number of years i worked across the wall
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh okay so any other questions for mr
 
01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.589 align:start position:0%
uh okay so any other questions for mr
baker

01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh i assume connie your hands up just
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
because it's still up
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
yup all right thank you thank you very
 
01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.549 align:start position:0%
yup all right thank you thank you very
much

01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you i have nobody else signed up
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
to speak on this bill
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
so i guess i'll ask any attendees who
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
anybody who's attendee would like to
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
weigh in or not if not
 
01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.589 align:start position:0%
weigh in or not if not
i

01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
don't see any hands oh i do
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
represent abramson you have a question
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
no i just wanted to make a remark that i
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
i have to introduce a bill at uh 10 15
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
so i'll have to step out for a few
 
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
minutes well you're in luck because
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
we're done here and we won't be coming
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
back until 10 30.
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
oh that's true
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
so timing is everything yes
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
thanks very much you know i thought
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative terry had a really good
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
point we
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
i i think there are many times when
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
particularly in this remote settings
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
where it's tough to know where the
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
lobbyists are coming from um i'm just
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if we can make a suggestion
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
regarding the sign up sheets that we ask
 
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:08.950 align:start position:0%
regarding the sign up sheets that we ask
people

01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
where where you know what state they
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
live in
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
um because yesterday we had a
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know multiple multiple
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
people signed up and we're going to have
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
it this afternoon i think too on uh
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
right to repair
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i i'm curious to find out
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
you know where where these calls are
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
well it's funny you mentioned that
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
because uh i when i first saw the
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
original sign up format way from the way
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
way way back when the original
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
was rolled out to it and and immediately
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
i noticed that they did not have the
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
mailing address you know they didn't
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
have that information in there
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
and um which as i just said you know i
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
realize you guys are lifting the
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
senate's model but
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
and the senate does piece of paper they
 
01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
do where they don't do cards like we
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
think cards like we do and i said i i
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
think it's very useful um but they know
 
01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
what we all kind of noted was oh but we
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
do ask for their phone numbers
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
so that sometimes we can get a little
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
bit from people's phone numbers but of
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
course uh as if it's present company
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
included there's some of us that do not
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
have a 603 phone number and uh so but i
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
would notice that
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
lately all these sheets that are coming
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
through for me
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
they nobody's filling in the numbers at
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
all so i get it
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
no and even i mean the phone numbers
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
we'd have to call them during committee
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
meeting right that's impractical
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
so um it is it is true that in this case
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
the these people are sending um
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
their testimony ahead of time in which
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
if we got that or we print that out we
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
would see it
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
now um which representative terry's
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
pointing out is that the public doesn't
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
know this
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
and um and so
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
as much as you might you were not so
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
happy with how sometimes i've tried a
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
little be you know casual about who the
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
people are coming in but i know a lot of
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
these people and i try to you know let's
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
let people know like just for instance
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
for kyle you know i knew that he worked
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
with the senate for many years so i
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to you know kind of bring that up
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
and try to let people know that if i
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
know this person that there's a reason
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
why i know them because they are regular
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
lobbyists that their regular people are
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
here but it is true um it's not been as
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
much of a problem for this committee but
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
for other committees they are just
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed with people from all over
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
the country who are right and even when
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
the public are speaking i i think we
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
want to know where they're from yeah no
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
i i i appreciate that very much so but i
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
don't i mean i don't think we can change
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
anything this year but if you know in
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
the in the future i think it would be
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
good for us to you know have an idea i
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
could certainly it is true that when
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
when i would read a pink card i would
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
often say who who they're representing
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
and what their position is on the bill
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
so i could be a little more vigilant in
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
especially when i because when i saw
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
internet coalition i never heard of the
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
internet coalition no right neither
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
certainly you've heard of wrath
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
pignatelli yes
 
01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.150 align:start position:0%
pignatelli yes
okay

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
yes well mr chair of if i'm hearing this
 
01:04:09.599 --> 01:04:11.109 align:start position:0%
yes well mr chair of if i'm hearing this
accurately

01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
accurately
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
there's a deficiency or a defect in the
 
01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.789 align:start position:0%
there's a deficiency or a defect in the
form

01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
form
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
from my point of view because and
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett and perhaps
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
yourself because because the form
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
that is used throughout the house is
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
that correct does not ask for
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
the uh the location of the
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh of the lobbyists uh affirm
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
so the burden falls upon
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
you mr chair to have to remember
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
to do that if we're going to
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
informally adopt the practice
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
of asking not only the identity of the
 
01:04:46.559 --> 01:04:47.589 align:start position:0%
of asking not only the identity of the
person

01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
who the person represents but where the
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
firm is located
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the burden will fall upon
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
you because
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
the forms cannot be
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
changed um until
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
uh until next year and and i want to
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
make clear i'm not and i think it's it's
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
become clear here there's there's no
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
intent on my part for us to be mining
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
for such information because we're
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
provincial or parochial in our outlook
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
but rather
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
that we really need to know
 
01:05:17.599 --> 01:05:18.630 align:start position:0%
that we really need to know
um

01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
where these people are coming from thank
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
bro well like i say it's um um when we
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
when we eventually get back to the house
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
you'll see the pink card
 
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
and the pink guard definitely asks for
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
all this information so
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that once we're all back in
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
this whole
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
thing will disappear so once i've had it
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
down perfect to a science and know
 
01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
exactly what to say and do
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
we'll have gone back to the old ways and
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
but i i would say there there's some
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
pleasures and minuses about this
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
pre-registration um you know i like the
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
idea that it gives people an opportunity
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
to upload their testimony so it makes
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
the clerk's life easier
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
um so there are you know i'm good or bad
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
but uh who knows what's going to happen
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
in the future yes go ahead
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
and regrettably sir for
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
some of us who are um who are new
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh newly elected um that to which you're
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
referring pink cards
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
um we've never seen such things so we're
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
really operating at a deficit having
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
never been able to meet in person before
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
right exactly but uh you know we've had
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
our we only have our pros and cons of
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
pink cards um
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
the uh sometimes we lose the pink card
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
because the other someone puts it in it
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the room and by the
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
time it gets past all around it gets
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
lost and you know so pink cards are
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
it's sort of you know another one of the
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
running jokes where where we always just
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
said we have you need to unmute well the
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
joke is a lot of people will come in and
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
especially the sponsors and start
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
testifying and and the the
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
german has to ask him to fill out a pink
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
card because they forgot to do one or
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
senators senators are terrible they
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
don't they don't get the pink card thing
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
so it's just like on mute
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
yes representative burroughs yeah just
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
quick question so hypothetically if 300
 
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
people from california signed up to
 
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.109 align:start position:0%
people from california signed up to
speak

01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
on a bill on our committee they could do
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
that theoretically that could happen
 
01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.430 align:start position:0%
that theoretically that could happen
well

01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
that could happen
 
01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:22.780 align:start position:0%
on hb overt education they had
 
01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:23.990 align:start position:0%
on hb overt education they had
[Music]

01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
a ton of out of state people signed up
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
so yeah now we're we're very fortunate
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
we we've got off lucky uh compared to
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
other committees in terms of this signup
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
sign up system but
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
but we've had some bills where we had
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
200 people signed up right you know we
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
did it you know and i to me it's great
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know the fact that 200 people can
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
you know get on board and and be able to
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's the speaking part i guess
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
i would would drive it would you know
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
bother me only because i probably
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have scheduled enough time for
 
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
having all those people that speak but
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
but but the fact that we have a system
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
where people um from the state and
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
and uh uh
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully they break their phone number
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
in it it says 603 so we know it really
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
are for new hampshire that that can be a
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
good thing so uh yes representative
 
01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.630 align:start position:0%
good thing so uh yes representative
abramson

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
abramson
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
oh sorry i was just gonna notice uh
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
right while you were saying it that i've
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
been to other committee hearings and
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
they have had you know 100 plus people
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
signed up to talk
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
and uh many of them are from out of
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
state sometimes we need somebody who has
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
a special expertise in an issue like the
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
convention estates issue
 
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.669 align:start position:0%
convention estates issue
um

01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:31.679 --> 01:08:33.030 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
in most cases it's uh
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
somebody trying to influence new
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire criminal law or self-defense
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
law or new hampshire elections law and
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
so yeah like i say we're we're very
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
fortunate that we haven't had two of
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
those problems but so
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
okay uh so uh we're gonna take a little
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
break here uh till 10 30 and which we
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
do our last of our phone
 
01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
phone phone morning
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
or internet morning tech morning all
 
01:09:06.560 --> 01:10:34.229 align:start position:0%
or internet morning tech morning all
right

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.239 --> 01:10:50.709 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.719 --> 01:13:31.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.840 --> 01:14:13.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.840 --> 01:18:44.390 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:44.400 --> 01:21:41.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.840 --> 01:22:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:44.080 --> 01:23:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.840 --> 01:26:42.070 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.080 --> 01:29:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:50.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%

social security number we've been forced
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
to suspend your social security number
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
we're notifying you that there's a legal
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement action filed on your name
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
for fraudulent activities
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to reach you about
 
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
your car's extended warranty
 
01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
these are all automated messages that
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
i've received on my cell phone in the
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
last six months all of which purported
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
to be from new hampshire are coming from
 
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
603 numbers
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
at best spam calls like this are a
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
nuisance and a waste of time and energy
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you can all relate to wanting
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
to answer phone calls that you think
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
might be from constituents only to find
 
01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:32.870 align:start position:0%
might be from constituents only to find
that

01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
it is not in fact coming from from
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
inside your district
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
um at worst calls like this can cause
 
01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
emotional distress or trap people in
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
costly scams or lead to identity theft
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
um so in a recent report from april of
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
last year the call blocking software
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
company truecaller estimated that
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
americans lost 19.7 billion dollars to
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
phone scams in the last 12 months
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
they stated that the average amount lost
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
per scam in the hundreds of dollars and
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
the total amount lost is increasing year
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
over year and over 60 percent of such
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
scams are initiated with a robocall
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
another important negative effect of
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
spam robo calls is that they erode trust
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
and legitimate uses of automated calls
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
such as for emergency notifications uh
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
school weather closures like i got
 
01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:22.950 align:start position:0%
school weather closures like i got
yesterday

01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
or public health alerts
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
it may not surprise you to know there
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
have already been many reports of spam
 
01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:28.950 align:start position:0%
have already been many reports of spam
calls

01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
calls
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
related to the covid vaccine
 
01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:31.990 align:start position:0%
related to the covid vaccine
availability

01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
availability
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
um so this bill aims to accomplish four
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
things um so first it updates some
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
definitions related to auto dialers and
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
phone number spoofing
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
as our current rsa
 
01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:45.270 align:start position:0%
as our current rsa
359e

01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
359e
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
has been updated a bit but most of it
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
has not been since the early 1990s
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
this would be important to help protect
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens in the event that
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
the fcc
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know federally adopts an overly
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
narrow definition which is a fear that
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
some people have expressed that could
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
cause robocalls to increase even further
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
second it requires telecom companies
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
operating in the state to provide more
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
tools for consumers to help them block
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
unwanted calls or numbers that have been
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
flagged as suspicious um so there's
 
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
certainly a variety of apps available
 
01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:20.070 align:start position:0%
certainly a variety of apps available
that

01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
say they can do this for smartphones um
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
i know as a consumer it's really
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to know if a given app is
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
effective or maybe even a scam itself
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
and i hope the committee will agree with
 
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
me that uh it's not appropriate to put
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
the onus and cost of avoiding such scams
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
on the consumer
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
when there's things that we can do
 
01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:40.390 align:start position:0%
when there's things that we can do
upstream

01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
upstream
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
third it requires reporting from the
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
commerce department on the prevalence of
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
robocalls in the state and the status of
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
mitigation measures
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
and suggestions for additional things
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
that we can do um to to protect people
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
from these things
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
um and then fourth it increases the
 
01:33:58.629 --> 01:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
penalty for any entities found
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
to be illegally conducting robocalls or
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
misrepresenting their location
 
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
and also reinforces the power of the
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
state attorney general's office to
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
prosecute and enforce this law without
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
requiring consumers to prove that they
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
have been been harmed by these calls so
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
it makes enforcement hopefully a little
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
bit easier
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
so i was inspired to uh to file this
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
legislation after seeing some from other
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
states um it's a little bit more modeled
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
after uh recent laws that passed in
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
arkansas and new york um so i'm open to
 
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
amendments um you know that that could
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
make it more effective or practical for
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
our state uh but my main hope is that we
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
can enact legislation uh to cover the
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
intent set out on the first page um to
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
ensure that the citizens of new
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire are protected from illegal
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
robocalls and ensure that the scammers
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
and the telecoms that are enabling them
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
are held accountable for
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
for these actions so i thank the
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
community for your time and i welcome
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
so we do have questions if you're
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
willing to entertain him so uh
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
good morning representative christian
 
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for bringing this
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
bill to us
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
um i know it's a tough year to be able
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
to look at notes from previous years
 
01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
i wondered if you'd had a chance
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
to look at the bills that have come up
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
previously before this committee and to
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
tell us how different this bill is
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
from the other bills
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
so i i have to admit um i've
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
not done as much homework as i had hoped
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
to um when i initially filed uh
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
this bill i was hoping that that ols
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
would um
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
contribute that part i i should also
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
mention this is uh probably like only my
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
second bill that i've prime sponsored
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
ever so please forgive me for um
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
for any mistakes there uh but yes i
 
01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.830 align:start position:0%
for any mistakes there uh but yes i
welcome

01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
information about about how this would
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
differ from other things that come up in
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
the past so further question you may
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
inquire thanks very much mr chair i'm
 
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
sorry to put you on the spot because i i
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
do understand what you're saying um i
 
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
mean one of the things that we struggled
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
with in this committee
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
is how
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
does this bill
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
um i mean you're gonna get there's gonna
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
be a lot of other testimony behind you
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
but how does this bill address
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
out-of-state companies
 
01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.470 align:start position:0%
out-of-state companies
um

01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that spoofing
 
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
goes on constantly i mean it's like if
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
if they find it in one call all they
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
have to do is disconnect that and start
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
something else the technology
 
01:36:37.110 --> 01:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
is very sophisticated to be able to do
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
this how does that
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
address it
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
um so i am aware that there's a lot you
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
know happening at the federal level to
 
01:36:49.109 --> 01:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
to try and um
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
go after
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
i'd say things that are initiated from
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
um you know from overseas um
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
i think the the part about making
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
i guess making more consumer tools
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
available um is is in part
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
a good way a good way to address this so
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
yeah so that you're you're getting
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
around um the the sort of constant um
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
technology if
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
if people crowdsource and report uh the
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
spoof calls and have the tools available
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
to actually block them um hopefully that
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you i i know i'm putting
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
um you said that this is based on model
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
legislation implemented in both arkansas
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
and new york uh do you know of any case
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
law i guess the new york law just passed
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
in 2019 so maybe it's too soon
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
if there's any case law on this where
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
the courts have looked at this and and
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
brought up any constitutional issues or
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
due process issues
 
01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:12.790 align:start position:0%
due process issues
um

01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
i don't want to
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
say something that i i can't back up i
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
want to say i i saw something about it
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
having held up in court but um
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
i don't want to commit 100 to that so
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i can't answer that question
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
and uh follow up for the question main
 
01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.790 align:start position:0%
and uh follow up for the question main
choir

01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
choir
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
um so this is this applies only to
 
01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.669 align:start position:0%
um so this is this applies only to
uh

01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
again companies in new hampshire so
 
01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.510 align:start position:0%
again companies in new hampshire so
out-of-state

01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
out-of-state
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh out-of-state robocall companies um
 
01:38:43.199 --> 01:38:44.390 align:start position:0%
uh out-of-state robocall companies um
it

01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
i i guess my concern is we might be
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
offering uh uh a false sense of
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
protection against robocalls when in
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
fact most of the robocalls come from out
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
scroll down here um i mean the section
 
01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:06.390 align:start position:0%
scroll down here um i mean the section
on

01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
sort of strengthening the prosecution
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't um
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
sorry it's not meant to to be restricted
 
01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:15.189 align:start position:0%
sorry it's not meant to to be restricted
to

01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
only calls coming from inside the state
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
i mean that's
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
that was the whole
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
idea was that it should protect people
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
in the state from calls coming outside
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
and um certainly give the attorney
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
general more power to escalate
 
01:39:29.679 --> 01:39:30.709 align:start position:0%
general more power to escalate
um

01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
cases up
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
outside the state just if that makes
 
01:39:35.119 --> 01:39:36.070 align:start position:0%
outside the state just if that makes
sense

01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.910 align:start position:0%
sense
yeah

01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay i wonder if we could just roll
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
we'll call him right back
 
01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:43.350 align:start position:0%
we'll call him right back
right

01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:44.310 align:start position:0%
right
okay

01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative burroughs has a
 
01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.030 align:start position:0%
uh representative burroughs has a
question

01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my correct
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
question um it's a two-prong question
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
i'll start with the first part i'm not
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
clear under um section 10
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh part p it says the department shall
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
adopt rules under rsa 541a what is the
 
01:40:04.629 --> 01:40:04.639 align:start position:0%
department i looked at the rsa briefly
 
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
and i not clear which department you're
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
referring to leave the commerce
 
01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:18.070 align:start position:0%
referring to leave the commerce
department

01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
actually looking at that yesterday too
 
01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:25.910 align:start position:0%
actually looking at that yesterday too
um

01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
we can have a commerce department but
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
follow up right yeah the question may
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
include yes my the second part of my
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
question aside from not knowing which
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
what the department is um
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
it talks about all these um issues that
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
need to be reported is it is there do
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
you have a does it look like there's
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
been a fiscal note on this is that
 
01:40:56.639 --> 01:40:57.750 align:start position:0%
been a fiscal note on this is that
correct

01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
that is correct um that was not done
 
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative mcclaire
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair um
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
i don't understand how we could enforce
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
this i mean i get i've got that social
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
security call many many times i i must
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
admit if i'm
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
driving in my car
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
i have fun dragging them on for 20
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
minutes giving them phony social
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
security numbers and you know at the end
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know telling them where to put it
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
but i mean how are we gonna find that
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
person i don't think we can
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.109 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:37.119 --> 01:41:38.310 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
my hope is the testimony that that
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
follows me will have more details about
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
the technology that is available um
 
01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
there is some technology available to
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
to kind of trace the other ends of um
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
these calls to to my knowledge um
 
01:41:57.750 --> 01:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
but yes it is a moving target
 
01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
i guess the hope is that
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
if we can find some folks and hold them
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
to account perhaps that will be a
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
deterrent but um
 
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
yes obviously this is a challenging
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony um
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:25.669 align:start position:0%
my question is
um

01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
knowing that it's difficult
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
to enforce this
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
or to investigate it and enforce this
 
01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:36.310 align:start position:0%
or to investigate it and enforce this
nonetheless

01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
is it not true that if we don't have a
 
01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.229 align:start position:0%
is it not true that if we don't have a
law

01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and we are able to
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
identify the source of the call
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
there would be no way that we could
 
01:42:51.199 --> 01:42:52.870 align:start position:0%
there would be no way that we could
prosecute

01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
prosecute
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
um because we wouldn't have a law so
 
01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:56.790 align:start position:0%
um because we wouldn't have a law so
therefore

01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
is that is that a reason why you
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
one reason why you've uh
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
submitted this bill
 
01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:06.639 align:start position:0%
yes i believe that that's a good summary
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
of uh one of the concerns anyway is that
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
that yes we need to have something at
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
least saying that this is not legal so
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%

the opportunity to testify on this very
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
important issue
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
for the record again my name is brandon
 
01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
garad i'm the chief of the consumer
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
protection and antitrust bureau at the
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of justice i
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
would like to clarify having reviewed
 
01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
specifically defined in this bill and
 
01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we're about to give
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
is because the department as defined by
 
01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
this bill does refer to the new
 
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of justice
 
01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:19.270 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of justice
so

01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
i i i appear before you as as a neutral
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
party on this bill
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
first speak to the issue of robocalls
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
because robocalls are not only a
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
statewide problem in new hampshire but a
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
nationwide problem
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
not only are they annoying and
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
disruptive but they're illegal um in
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
many contexts
 
01:44:41.669 --> 01:44:41.679 align:start position:0%
scammers use robo calls in order to
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
solicit people's hard-earned life
 
01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:44.870 align:start position:0%
solicit people's hard-earned life
savings

01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
savings
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
and really to take advantage of people
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
that are put into an unfortunate and
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
vulnerable position
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
through the use of robocalls
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
this has been a top priority for
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
attorney general mcdonald as well as
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
this bureau in the past several years
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
combating robocalls through
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
as much consumer outreach and education
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
we're we're admittedly a little bit
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
hamstrung by the pandemic right now and
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
our ability to get out there
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
and spread the
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
the information to people but we have
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
continued to do the best that we can in
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
terms of issuing regular you know press
 
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.189 align:start position:0%
terms of issuing regular you know press
releases

01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
releases
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
constantly you know speaking to the
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
media to try to warn people about scams
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
doing as much consumer outreach as
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
possible um really trying to get the
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
word out about robocalls and about the
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
scams that are out there to give
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
consumers the tools to hopefully protect
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
themselves from becoming a victim of
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
these really terrible invasive and
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
illegal calls
 
01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
additionally you know this uh office
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
under attorney general gordon mcdonald
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
has really taken the reins nationally
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
and has worked very closely with a small
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
group of states including north carolina
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
to lead the charge
 
01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
that brought the state's attorneys
 
01:45:56.470 --> 01:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
general and the u.s telecom companies
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
together to start talking about how
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to solve this problem and
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
because the reason it requires the
 
01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
meeting those two parties is you know in
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
order to really solve this problem which
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'll speak to you know some of the
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
challenges of doing that in a few
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
minutes is going to require a
 
01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:12.629 align:start position:0%
minutes is going to require a
technological

01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
technological
 
01:46:12.639 --> 01:46:13.830 align:start position:0%
technological
fix

01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
fix
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
the ability to stop the calls from
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
coming in to this country because as
 
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
i'll speak to the majority of these
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
calls coming from outside the country
 
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
and it it's going to require u.s telecom
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
to take steps to change the way their
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
networks work
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
to do everything that they can to make
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
sure that they are protecting
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
not only new hampshire citizens but
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
united states citizens from these
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:44.719 align:start position:0%
again educating consumers is a great way
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
to prevent these that we have the
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
ability to do
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
the more people know
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
the more people change their it's
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that we have to live in a
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
society where you have to change your
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
habits in terms of how you you relate to
 
01:46:59.669 --> 01:46:59.679 align:start position:0%
your phone but a few small steps things
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
like not answering the phone if you
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
don't recognize the number um
 
01:47:05.189 --> 01:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
never giving out personal identifying
 
01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
information if you don't know who you're
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
talking to and absolutely never sending
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
money uh never sending money whether
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's by gift cards money transfer credit
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
card number anything to somebody that
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
you don't know uh
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
if we as a society adopt that mentality
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
would take away all of the robocaller's
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
power and if people stop responding to
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
robo calls eventually robocalls would go
 
01:47:25.199 --> 01:47:26.629 align:start position:0%
robo calls eventually robocalls would go
away

01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
we like to think we've made some strides
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
in educating people but is no small task
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
and it's not going to be a quick fix
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
and we continue to we look forward to a
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
day where we can get back out into the
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
community in person and educate new
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire consumers um but we're doing
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
the best that we can with the the tools
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
that we have during the pandemic to do
 
01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:46.390 align:start position:0%
that we have during the pandemic to do
so

01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:47.430 align:start position:0%
so
so

01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
with that being in mind i i really i
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate the legislature's effort to
 
01:47:55.750 --> 01:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to give the state creative new
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
ways to combat robocalls i think that
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
this issue affects
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state and you know it's
 
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's one of those rare issues is
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
completely bipartisan it is completely
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
universal to everybody that owns a phone
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
owns an email account you know owns
 
01:48:10.639 --> 01:48:12.709 align:start position:0%
owns an email account you know owns
anything

01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
this impacts everybody so i i really
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that we are thinking about
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
creative solutions to how we address
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
these problems um i would like to point
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
i would like to share some information
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
with the committee my experiences with
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
combating robocalls and express
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
based on those experiences um some
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
concerns that i have with the way this
 
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
bill is currently working
 
01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:35.109 align:start position:0%
bill is currently working
so

01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
i believe it was representative abel
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
asked the question of you know do we
 
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
need to have a law on the books to give
 
01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
ability to prosecute those that are
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
making illegal robocalls
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's very important that we do so and
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to report that we already have
 
01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
that ability under current case law
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
both under new hampshire's consumer
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
protection act 358-a
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
which incorporates new hampshire's
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
automatic telephone dialing statute
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
which is 359e
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
um currently spoofing any number um
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
is a violation of the consumer
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
protection act which is prosecutable
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
both civilly and criminally in the state
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
we can take it a step further um the
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
scams that are being referenced um
 
01:49:19.590 --> 01:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
grandparent scam irs scams social
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
security scam any of those what the
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
callers are doing is providing false
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
information to people in order to get
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
them to turn over their money and
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
that is just plain simple theft
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
under new hampshire's criminal code
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
there would be no problem as a
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
prosecutor if you could identify the
 
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
person making the call
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
that would be a very easy theft by
 
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
deception case to bring the problem is
 
01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
not with the law the problem is with
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
identifying the individuals that are
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
making these calls
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
and you know we we really have
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
done everything possible to try to
 
01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
investigate these and try to hold people
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
accountable but for a number of reasons
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
that i'll speak to momentarily
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
it unfortunately it just doesn't work
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
that way because they're not here for
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:09.679 --> 01:50:10.709 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
in order to prosecute a robocaller
 
01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's initiating a robocall
 
01:50:17.590 --> 01:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
the person does not have to be in the
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire so i want to be
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
clear about that
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law would give the
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office or even the
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
county attorney's offices the ability to
 
01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
prosecute a robo-caller who is calling
 
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens you know using a
 
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
robocalling device to come into new
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire through a telephonic network
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
and commit fraud or commit theft we
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
could prosecute those individuals if we
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
could identify them locate them and
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
charge them
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
that the vast majority of them
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
are located internationally and we have
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
no jurisdiction to investigate
 
01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
internationally we certainly don't have
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
the resources to investigate
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
but let me give you a little bit of
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
information on what it actually takes
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
to identify you go through the process
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
of identifying
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
the source of a robocaller
 
01:51:12.239 --> 01:51:13.109 align:start position:0%
the source of a robocaller
so

01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
as you've noted as you know the the
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative noted and as the
 
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
committee knows everybody gets these you
 
01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
know multiple times a day and they look
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
like 603 numbers coming into your phone
 
01:51:25.590 --> 01:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunately not as simple as that
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
because none of them are actually six or
 
01:51:29.590 --> 01:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
three numbers they're almost all spoofed
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
numbers that are coming from another
 
01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
state or coming from outside the country
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
in order to determine that
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
to determine the true original source of
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
a robocall we need to use a process
 
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
which is called the traceback process
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
and what this is is we don't have the
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
ability to do it ourselves we rely on
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
u.s telecom to help us with this process
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
because it's not just as simple as
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
all right you look up and find where the
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
origin of the call came from because
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
when a call is initiated there are
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
several different i'll call them hops
 
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
jumps that it makes before it reaches
 
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
its final destination so it can go from
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
one network to another network to
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
another network and sometimes there's
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
several different spots along the way
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
before it finally reaches its
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
destination the victim who sees the
 
01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
number come up on their phone
 
01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
so in order to figure out where that
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
original call came from
 
01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
first you have to determine the united
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
states point of entry
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
so all calls to call from others
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
overseas need to enter through a point
 
01:52:32.709 --> 01:52:32.719 align:start position:0%
of entry in the united states um to get
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
onto our networks
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
so that is the process where you know a
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
technological fix would really help to
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
completely choke out robocalls that are
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
coming from overseas if you could
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
implement it and i know this you know
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
everybody wants it quickly but it's a
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
very complicated issue the technology
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
you know needs to be developed and
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
implemented at a rate that it's going to
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
be successful and
 
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
there have been strides made but it's
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
just not all the way there yet the goal
 
01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
is that at that point of entry once it's
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
gone through several hops
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
it will be choked out at that point
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
where it tries to enter the united
 
01:53:02.639 --> 01:53:03.430 align:start position:0%
where it tries to enter the united
states

01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
but for our purposes if this bill were
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
to pass in its current form it would
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the department of
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
justice would be investigating and
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
prosecuting every robocall that comes
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
into the state of new hampshire
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
in order to do that on each call
 
01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
we would need to take that original
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
caller the call that came into the
 
01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:24.709 align:start position:0%
caller the call that came into the
consumer

01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
the date
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
the number that came in and the
 
01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:29.830 align:start position:0%
the number that came in and the
consumer's

01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
consumer's
 
01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
caller information and provide that to
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
us telecom within 10 days of that call
 
01:53:35.589 --> 01:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
being received because after that the
 
01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
data is gone
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
u.s telecom then has to do a traceback
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
process which
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
step by step goes through each one of
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
those hops that that call took
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
and traces it all the way back to the
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
original source of the call
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
this is a very
 
01:53:58.070 --> 01:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
manual labor and time consuming process
 
01:53:58.080 --> 01:53:59.350 align:start position:0%
manual labor and time consuming process
um

01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
that can be done and has been done in
 
01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
several instances but the problem is
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
that even once it's all the way done
 
01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
assuming that you're able to
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
to get all that process because any loss
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the chain of hops if you you know the
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
information is lost at a certain point
 
01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
um that breaks the chain and you can't
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
get all the way back to the original
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
caller but assuming that you can
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
what it will provide you with is a
 
01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
physical location that is often in
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
another country
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
um without providing any identifying
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
information for an individual that made
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
the call
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
or a company that made the call that
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
could be subject to an attorney
 
01:54:36.149 --> 01:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
general's investigation and prosecution
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
when we have tried to trace scam calls
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
back ourselves internally we've tried to
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
do it through
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
um subpoenaing ip addresses
 
01:54:47.189 --> 01:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
and it takes you know
 
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
we issue a spin it's often a month
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
before we get a result and then the
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
result that we are able to identify is
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
the country of origin
 
01:54:56.550 --> 01:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
and that's where our investigative train
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
stops at that point
 
01:54:58.560 --> 01:54:59.510 align:start position:0%
stops at that point
so

01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
we can identify generally what region of
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
the globe they are coming from
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
we do not have the ability currently
 
01:55:08.950 --> 01:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
to identify i mean if they were coming
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
from within new hampshire we would have
 
01:55:12.070 --> 01:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
the ability and we would be able to do
 
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
this under the current tools that we
 
01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:15.109 align:start position:0%
this under the current tools that we
have

01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:55:16.629 --> 01:55:16.639 align:start position:0%
throughout the history of this traceback
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
process because we have a assistant
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
attorney general in this bureau that
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
sits on a regular
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
robocall working group with members of
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
attorneys general from all over the
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
country uh who talk about you know these
 
01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
tracebacks where are the calls coming
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
from where can we identify within the
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
united states and there have been
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
sources of calls identified um in a few
 
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:36.950 align:start position:0%
sources of calls identified um in a few
states

01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:55:40.149 --> 01:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh texas arizona um i believe north
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
carolina zero have originated from new
 
01:55:42.239 --> 01:55:43.589 align:start position:0%
carolina zero have originated from new
hampshire

01:55:43.589 --> 01:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
which is great i mean
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
we that's what we want to hear we hope
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
that these you know scammers are not
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
physically in our state it would be
 
01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.189 align:start position:0%
physically in our state it would be
great

01:55:51.189 --> 01:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
to be able to investigate prosecute and
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
shut them down
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
but you know similar to
 
01:55:58.629 --> 01:55:58.639 align:start position:0%
what we've heard before
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
even if we have the ability to do that
 
01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:02.149 align:start position:0%
even if we have the ability to do that
um

01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
you arrest you prosecute somebody else
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
just takes the place this is not a
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
problem that is going to be able to
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
solve by picking off individuals and you
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
know prosecuting them it's a problem
 
01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
that needs to be solved technologically
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
and that's not to say that we shouldn't
 
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
be doing anything because if any of
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
these individuals are ever identified as
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
originating in the state of new
 
01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:24.310 align:start position:0%
originating in the state of new
hampshire

01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
or making calls in a neighboring state
 
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
where we have the ability to investigate
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
this office is committed to a full
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
investigation and prosecution based on
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
whatever our resources allow us to do
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
we would love nothing more than to be
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
able to identify and prosecute these
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
individuals the problem is they just are
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
not in this country or in any states
 
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
where we have a realistic ability to go
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
in and investigate
 
01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:50.470 align:start position:0%
in and investigate
so

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
with all of that in mind
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know i feel that i regularly come
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
before you when i talk about resources
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
but you know again i would like to talk
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
about the resources of the consumer
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
protection bureau
 
01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:02.790 align:start position:0%
protection bureau
we

01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
do a lot of work on very limited
 
01:57:07.589 --> 01:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
resources and as a result of that
 
01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
i never want to say that our resources
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
are maxed because i want to be honest i
 
01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
think we could always do a little more
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
and we tried to do as much as possible
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
but our resources are very close to
 
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
being stretched as thin as they can
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
possibly go
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
if this were enacted
 
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
and the the legislature decided we want
 
01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office to begin
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
regularly investigating and prosecuting
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
all of the robocalls in the state of new
 
01:57:33.119 --> 01:57:34.229 align:start position:0%
all of the robocalls in the state of new
hampshire

01:57:34.229 --> 01:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
as well as engaging in rulemaking for
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
u.s telecom for telecom companies and
 
01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:40.470 align:start position:0%
u.s telecom for telecom companies and
also

01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
making an annual report about what we've
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
been finding throughout the year every
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
robocall in the state of new hampshire
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
it would require the cr realistically i
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
just want to give you my assessment of
 
01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
what it would take
 
01:57:54.149 --> 01:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
is the creation of an entirely new unit
 
01:57:55.589 --> 01:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
within the attorney general's office
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
that could focus only on combating
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
robocalls that would at a minimum need
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
to be staffed by a full-time attorney
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
probably more than one full-time
 
01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
attorney but at a minimum full-time
 
01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
attorney a full-time paralegal and a
 
01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:08.719 align:start position:0%
full-time investigator
 
01:58:08.719 --> 01:58:09.589 align:start position:0%
full-time investigator
um

01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
and i want to be you know perfectly
 
01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:11.910 align:start position:0%
and i want to be you know perfectly
honest

01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
honest
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
in the event that the legislature makes
 
01:58:16.149 --> 01:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
it a priority to to combat robocalls and
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
to give the department of justice those
 
01:58:20.229 --> 01:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
resources to do just that
 
01:58:20.239 --> 01:58:20.950 align:start position:0%
resources to do just that
i

01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate based on all the
 
01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:25.679 align:start position:0%
information that i just explained to you
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
that that investment would yield many
 
01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:29.679 align:start position:0%
results i think that what you would see
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year is a report that
 
01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
said we've engaged in numerous robocall
 
01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:35.350 align:start position:0%
said we've engaged in numerous robocall
investigations

01:58:35.350 --> 01:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
and they either are inconclusive as to
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
where the call came from because we
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't complete the traceback process
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
in time
 
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
or they originated overseas and we like
 
01:58:45.189 --> 01:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction to investigate and
 
01:58:45.199 --> 01:58:47.030 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction to investigate and
prosecute

01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
prosecute
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's my assessment i i really want to
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
emphasize that i think it's great that
 
01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
we are thinking about new ways to combat
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
robocalls it's excellent that this is on
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
the forefront of everybody's mind
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
because everybody including me and
 
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
everybody at the doj is like everybody
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
else in the state fed up with robocalls
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
and ready for a solution to this problem
 
01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:10.870 align:start position:0%
and ready for a solution to this problem
this

01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
proposed solution
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
i don't think would ultimately be the
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
most effective one but is currently not
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
a realistic one based on the current
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
resources and makeup of the consumer
 
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
protection bureau at the department of
 
01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:24.870 align:start position:0%
protection bureau at the department of
justice

01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
justice
 
01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
so i thank you very much for your time
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
and your consideration of these issues
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
well we do plenty of questions
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative burroughs is first
 
01:59:37.589 --> 01:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
question um you said that this is likely
 
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
a techno technic if i can say it
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
technical logical fix um and so here's
 
01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
my question i have an app called vmail
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
and it it screens out about 90 of the
 
01:59:55.589 --> 01:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
robo calls so if the technology exists
 
01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
why can't
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
u.s telecom why can't they implement
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
something like umail that would save a
 
02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
lot of heartache for
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
consumers in new hampshire and beyond
 
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
so i i'm not aware of that current
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
technology so i can't speak to the
 
02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
complexity of it or the ability of
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
telecom to implement it on a mass
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
on a mass market like that i said i'm
 
02:00:20.550 --> 02:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
just not familiar with that technology
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
or what it would take so unfortunately
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's a question that i think would be
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
more appropriate for the telecom
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
companies and i i don't know that i have
 
02:00:29.669 --> 02:00:29.679 align:start position:0%
the ability to answer it yeah i know
 
02:00:30.629 --> 02:00:30.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
okay um i thank you for uh
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
for your presentation that was uh
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
i came away
 
02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
there's no way the attorney general's
 
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
office here in the state of new
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire is going to
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
wrap this up i also uh without i didn't
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
even i think uh i have xfinity but all
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
of a sudden in the last month
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
nobody called me uh but uh they they
 
02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
they uh
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know you get a number
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
and it says right next to it is
 
02:01:14.159 --> 02:01:15.430 align:start position:0%
and it says right next to it is
basically

02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
they think it's spam or or some sort of
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know fake
 
02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
and i haven't i didn't do anything i
 
02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
didn't do an app i didn't i think it's
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
just been put into my uh system
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
in xfinity and um
 
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
it uh i don't know how you still just
 
02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
some of them still get through
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
but i would say
 
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:41.589 --> 02:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
you know you just heard
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh i i
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard of that app but i i know
 
02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
i have one just like it and it it's on
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
my system
 
02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
and i would say uh four out of five
 
02:01:52.719 --> 02:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
and i would say uh four out of five
um

02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:53.250 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:53.250 --> 02:01:54.470 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
you know whatever the calls were
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh get marked
 
02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
i think that i think that's where the uh
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
the uh solution is going to come from
 
02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
and i agree with uh
 
02:02:08.719 --> 02:02:09.669 align:start position:0%
and i agree with uh
um

02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
who's talking barrels was it
 
02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh what's your question chris uh mike
 
02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:15.910 align:start position:0%
uh what's your question chris uh mike
well

02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
i said do you know well yeah he should i
 
02:02:20.950 --> 02:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
just saying i'm saying would you believe
 
02:02:22.870 --> 02:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
there is a solution here
 
02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh and it's already being applied
 
02:02:25.119 --> 02:02:26.790 align:start position:0%
uh and it's already being applied
um

02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
and that's it i mean i i i liked your
 
02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
presentation it was nice i i get your
 
02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:35.109 align:start position:0%
presentation it was nice i i get your
enthusiasm

02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
but it was uh i think i think it's going
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
to have to come from
 
02:02:41.589 --> 02:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
the telecommunity you know the major
 
02:02:41.599 --> 02:02:43.750 align:start position:0%
the telecommunity you know the major
companies

02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
companies
 
02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:45.830 align:start position:0%
companies
not

02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
would you believe so you don't have to
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
answer that would you believe yes
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative abramson
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
um isn't it the fact that um
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh part of the reason for making
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
something illegal is so that if somebody
 
02:03:03.990 --> 02:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh has a cause of action if somebody
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
sues for example in another state or in
 
02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:08.070 align:start position:0%
sues for example in another state or in
um

02:03:08.070 --> 02:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
international tort case
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
that they're able to pursue
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
punitive damages based on
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that the harm caused is not
 
02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
just caused by the actions of the person
 
02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
that you're suing
 
02:03:22.629 --> 02:03:22.639 align:start position:0%
but based on evidence that they've also
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
violated some law in the process in
 
02:03:25.589 --> 02:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
other words
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh passing this you're saying it'd be
 
02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:28.390 align:start position:0%
uh passing this you're saying it'd be
difficult

02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
to go after a lot of interstate and
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
international cases
 
02:03:36.149 --> 02:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
um but wouldn't this also help or
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this bill at least help people
 
02:03:39.189 --> 02:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
who are
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
uh trying to pursue this in a civil case
 
02:03:47.109 --> 02:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
so i i don't practice we do have civil
 
02:03:48.629 --> 02:03:48.639 align:start position:0%
law enforcement authority here in the
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
department of justice but i'm not a
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
civil practitioner by practice
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
i don't practice private civil law so i
 
02:03:58.550 --> 02:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
can't speak too much to that what i can
 
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
say is to reiterate that to the extent
 
02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:02.950 align:start position:0%
say is to reiterate that to the extent
actually

02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:04:04.709 --> 02:04:04.719 align:start position:0%
having a law that you know makes
 
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
robocalls illegal
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
is the concern we already have those
 
02:04:09.669 --> 02:04:09.679 align:start position:0%
laws in place
 
02:04:09.679 --> 02:04:11.030 align:start position:0%
laws in place
robocalls

02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
robocalls
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
that use any form of spoofing or
 
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
manipulation are currently illegal in
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
any call whether it's a robocall or a
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
manual call
 
02:04:19.679 --> 02:04:21.030 align:start position:0%
manual call
that

02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
presents a consumer with false
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
information in an attempt to trick them
 
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
into giving over money or personal
 
02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:27.669 align:start position:0%
into giving over money or personal
information

02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
is theft in the state of new hampshire
 
02:04:31.589 --> 02:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
and is also in you know to the extent
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's done in commerce could be an unfair
 
02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
deceptive act or practice under the
 
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act so we have
 
02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
diverse laws that are currently in
 
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
effect that
 
02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
in my opinion make all aspects of
 
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
robocalling uh
 
02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
illegal unless it's engaged unless they
 
02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
register for you want to do robocalls in
 
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
the state you have to register with the
 
02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
consumer protection bureau
 
02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
you have to pay an annual fee
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
and you have to use it for a legitimate
 
02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
purpose as long as you're doing that
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
your robocalls are fine but any
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
robocalls that occur in the state of new
 
02:05:06.629 --> 02:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire that manipulate
 
02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
trick the person into you know answering
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
the phone based on where the call is
 
02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
do any sort of spoofing or have any sort
 
02:05:16.149 --> 02:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
of fraudulent intent are already illegal
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
02:05:17.679 --> 02:05:18.870 align:start position:0%
of the state
follow-up

02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
further question may inquire
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
um aren't but aren't there other cases
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
that uh i guess i'm sounding
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
argumentative aren't there other cases
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
that uh wrote that are robocalls that
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
may be international that aren't
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
spoofing there aren't fishing that
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
aren't getting at your personal
 
02:05:35.119 --> 02:05:36.070 align:start position:0%
aren't getting at your personal
um

02:05:36.070 --> 02:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:38.790 --> 02:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
information or getting at your money
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
but they could still be either
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
borderline harassment where
 
02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
the harm caused may trigger a civil case
 
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't rise to the level of
 
02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:51.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't yet rise to the level of
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh criminal prosecution where it's still
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
a series of robocalls where they're
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
calling you same companies calling you
 
02:05:57.280 --> 02:05:58.229 align:start position:0%
calling you same companies calling you
from

02:05:58.229 --> 02:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
out of state over and over again and you
 
02:06:02.550 --> 02:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
want to take them to court
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
to enjoy them from doing it
 
02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:07.189 align:start position:0%
to enjoy them from doing it
and

02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:09.679 align:start position:0%
if the company is not registered with
 
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection any trust bureau
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
then that is an unfair and deceptive act
 
02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
of practice in the state um if they are
 
02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
registered and they're abusing
 
02:06:21.430 --> 02:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
you know they're engaging in you know
 
02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:22.709 align:start position:0%
you know they're engaging in you know
aggressive

02:06:22.709 --> 02:06:22.719 align:start position:0%
aggressive
 
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
um robo-calling for a you know
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
legitimate purpose
 
02:06:27.119 --> 02:06:27.990 align:start position:0%
legitimate purpose
um

02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
that could potentially be an unfair
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
deceptive action practice depending on
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
how often it happens and what tactics
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
they're using calls
 
02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
the point is that in order there are
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
already laws that define when somebody
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
can do a robocall in the state and as
 
02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
long as you're complying with them
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's not currently a a violation but
 
02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:49.830 align:start position:0%
it's not currently a a violation but
any

02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
attempt to use the robocall you know for
 
02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:56.719 align:start position:0%
a harassing or a fraudulent purpose is
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
already against the laws of the state of
 
02:07:00.629 --> 02:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i can't speak to you know
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
what you would have to prove in a civil
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
case because i'm just not sure uh other
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
than you know consumers can bring a
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
private right of action on if they
 
02:07:09.910 --> 02:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
believe there's been a violation of the
 
02:07:11.589 --> 02:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
and so if somebody were calling from out
 
02:07:14.709 --> 02:07:14.719 align:start position:0%
of state and hadn't registered and
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
continued to call a new hampshire
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
consumer that law is already in effect
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
that would enable them to to bring a
 
02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
private right of action similarly if
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
somebody was registered but harassing
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again you know
 
02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
calling to the point where the consumer
 
02:07:31.189 --> 02:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
believed that you know this amount of
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
harassment really i think it rises to
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
the level of an unfair business practice
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
i would like to hold this company
 
02:07:38.629 --> 02:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
accountable they have the tools to do
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
that under the current law
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so i hope you get that max because
 
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
it i know i tried to explain it before
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
but having random online i want to
 
02:07:50.149 --> 02:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
reinforce it that under 358a the
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
penalties of 358a are a that that the
 
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office can go after
 
02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:55.510 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office can go after
you

02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:57.030 align:start position:0%
you
or

02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:58.069 align:start position:0%
or
or

02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
you have the right of private action and
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
get triple damages
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
that correct bret yes
 
02:08:08.229 --> 02:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
all right fair enough okay okay
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
representative michael here
 
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you sir uh
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
i've got a question i i obviously that
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
the social security call the the amazon
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
call the irs call are very easy to
 
02:08:22.709 --> 02:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
figure out that they're
 
02:08:24.149 --> 02:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
they're bogus
 
02:08:26.310 --> 02:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
but i get a lot of calls from from
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
veterans uh
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
folks police fire fire department even
 
02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know political uh
 
02:08:36.149 --> 02:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
parties asking for money and i'm
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
suspicious of that but then again it's
 
02:08:40.709 --> 02:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a legitimate
 
02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
cause in the other hands
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea whether those tend
 
02:08:48.629 --> 02:08:48.639 align:start position:0%
to be phony as well
 
02:08:48.639 --> 02:08:49.510 align:start position:0%
to be phony as well
so

02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
what i can give you is my general advice
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
that i give to everybody who you know
 
02:08:56.310 --> 02:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
has questions about whether a call is
 
02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate or not
 
02:08:59.910 --> 02:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
which is that if you receive a call and
 
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's asking you for money any
 
02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:04.079 align:start position:0%
context unless it's you know somebody
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
that you know you can confirm you know
 
02:09:07.589 --> 02:09:07.599 align:start position:0%
the identity it's your your wife or your
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
wife's family or your brother or
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
something like that your best friend and
 
02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's a confirmed number and you
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
recognize his voice uh
 
02:09:15.510 --> 02:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
even then you should be suspicious but
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
unless it's one of those types of
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
persons you should be highly highly
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
suspicious if somebody's soliciting any
 
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
type of money from you over the phone
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
but to the extent that you feel you know
 
02:09:28.149 --> 02:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
we'll use a police association because i
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
actually got one of these calls on my
 
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
way into work i violated my own rule
 
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
which is never answer your phone if you
 
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
don't recognize the number i was
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
expecting a call from my vet so i felt
 
02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
that i needed to answer it just in case
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
but i was driving in and it was a call
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
that said you know this is the
 
02:09:43.669 --> 02:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
police officers association of such and
 
02:09:43.679 --> 02:09:44.629 align:start position:0%
police officers association of such and
such

02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
such
 
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you know you feel
 
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
wow if this is legitimate i'd really
 
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
like to contribute i'd really like to
 
02:09:53.109 --> 02:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
know more about this
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
get off the phone and research it
 
02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
yourself is any legitimate charity any
 
02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:00.069 align:start position:0%
yourself is any legitimate charity any
legitimate

02:10:00.069 --> 02:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
02:10:02.550 --> 02:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
requester of funds
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
should have information out there that
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
allows you as a consumer to make an
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
informed decision about whether it's
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate or not and if there's any
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
sort of immediacy you know you have to
 
02:10:12.790 --> 02:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
make a decision while you're on the
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
phone or you have to give right now
 
02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
there's no reason that any legitimate
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
charity or any legitimate purpose would
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
put that burden on a consumer to make a
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
decision so quickly
 
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
you have the ability an enormous tool at
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
your disposal in the internet
 
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
to thoroughly research anybody that's
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
asking you for money and to make a call
 
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
on your own so that you know what number
 
02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
you're calling
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know who's on the other end of the
 
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
phone to find out the information that
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
you need to know the point is you just
 
02:10:42.550 --> 02:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
can't trust
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
anybody can say they're anybody on the
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
other end of a call that comes to you
 
02:10:48.310 --> 02:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
if you take the power and you make the
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
call and you do the research then you
 
02:10:52.149 --> 02:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
can be certain that you're talking to a
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
legitimate source on the other end
 
02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
could i have a follow-up question
 
02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
further question we inquire
 
02:10:57.440 --> 02:10:58.229 align:start position:0%
further question we inquire
oh

02:10:58.229 --> 02:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:11:00.149 --> 02:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
so these people would have to be
 
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
registered wouldn't they
 
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
could we ask them what's their
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
registration number one of the things i
 
02:11:07.750 --> 02:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
do is i say if i think it might be
 
02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:09.599 align:start position:0%
legitimate i say look i don't get my
 
02:11:11.350 --> 02:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
credit card over the phone
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
if if you mail me a request i'll i'll do
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
something about it and of course then
 
02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
they say well i'll let you talk to the
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
boss and of course they ask you for your
 
02:11:22.149 --> 02:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
credit card again
 
02:11:24.149 --> 02:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
but sometimes i've actually gotten a
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
mailbag so uh
 
02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:26.709 align:start position:0%
mailbag so uh
but

02:11:26.709 --> 02:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
it'd be great if there was a registry
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
that we could look at to see if these
 
02:11:31.119 --> 02:11:32.229 align:start position:0%
that we could look at to see if these
guys

02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
guys
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
have registered to be a robocaller
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
so you can always you know if
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
in order for it whether it's a business
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
or it's an individual
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
if they're legitimate and they are
 
02:11:46.870 --> 02:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
registered to do business in the state
 
02:11:48.790 --> 02:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire they should be able to
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
provide you with that information you
 
02:11:51.910 --> 02:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
can always make an inquiry to this
 
02:11:53.589 --> 02:11:53.599 align:start position:0%
office and say you know i've received
 
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
this call i asked them what is the name
 
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
of the business or what is the name of
 
02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
the individual that registered in the
 
02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire that makes this a
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
legal um
 
02:12:02.159 --> 02:12:04.629 align:start position:0%
legal um
robo-call

02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
robo-call
 
02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
and we can tell you i mean we we we have
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
a registration i i agree with you it
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
would probably make more sense if it was
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
published and readily available on our
 
02:12:13.990 --> 02:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
website um our website is something that
 
02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
we're always striving to improve and
 
02:12:17.589 --> 02:12:17.599 align:start position:0%
that is a recommendation that i will
 
02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
take very seriously i think we probably
 
02:12:21.030 --> 02:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
should be publishing it to the public
 
02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:21.910 align:start position:0%
should be publishing it to the public
but

02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:22.950 align:start position:0%
but
um

02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
currently you have the ability to to
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
call the consumer protection hotline if
 
02:12:29.589 --> 02:12:29.599 align:start position:0%
you have any inquiries and you know you
 
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
you can ask and we'll tell you if a
 
02:12:32.790 --> 02:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
business is registered with us or not
 
02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
and if they're not it may be something
 
02:12:36.069 --> 02:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
where it makes sense to file a consumer
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
great representative van gaal
 
02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:12:46.149 --> 02:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
some incredible insights
 
02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
this bill represents i think a herculean
 
02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:49.669 align:start position:0%
this bill represents i think a herculean
effort

02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
effort
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
on the part of representatives
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
um looking at an issue that's really
 
02:12:55.109 --> 02:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
been bothersome for most of our
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
constituents and i i applaud that and um
 
02:13:00.270 --> 02:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
and i know she mentioned something like
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
19.7 billion dollars in losses i mean
 
02:13:04.870 --> 02:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
it's an incredible problem
 
02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh given that this bill may not be the
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
actual tool going forward waiting for a
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
technological fix is there anything that
 
02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
we can do legislatively that will help
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
to support your efforts to cut down
 
02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
robocalls and the scams that they may
 
02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:21.189 align:start position:0%
robocalls and the scams that they may
represent

02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's a difficult question
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
i i don't know that i can answer it on
 
02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
the spot today i didn't come prepared to
 
02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
to answer that question
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
there may be i mean i i'd be i'd be
 
02:13:34.229 --> 02:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
happy to to take that question and you
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
know schedule a meeting to talk about
 
02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
this at some point once i have the
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to spend it our attorney
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
general is in a transition phase right
 
02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
now we're going to have a new attorney
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
general soon who's going to have the
 
02:13:45.910 --> 02:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
ability to set his or her own policies
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
and priorities um but those types of
 
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
reach outs from the legislature we
 
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
welcome that we we would love to to have
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
those kinds of discussions and have the
 
02:13:57.669 --> 02:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
ability to prepare and think about you
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
know really is there a legislation it's
 
02:14:01.270 --> 02:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
not going to be a fix but is there
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
anything that we can do as a state to
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
have better protections for our citizens
 
02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
we would be happy to be involved in
 
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
those i believe obviously would be
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
subject to the decision of a new
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
attorney general but i i would hope that
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
he or she would be as open to that as
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
attorney general mcdonald has been and
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
certainly this has been a priority of
 
02:14:19.270 --> 02:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
mine as the director of the consumer
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
protection bureau so
 
02:14:22.629 --> 02:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
thank you i think that's an incredible
 
02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
way for us to
 
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
to network when we see something that
 
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
isn't quite what we can use today but
 
02:14:29.589 --> 02:14:29.599 align:start position:0%
maybe there are things that we can do as
 
02:14:31.589 --> 02:14:31.599 align:start position:0%
we work towards something stronger uh
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.480 align:start position:0%

02:14:37.109 --> 02:14:37.119 align:start position:0%

garage on is bringing this coming before
 
02:14:53.109 --> 02:14:53.119 align:start position:0%
us year after year after year because
 
02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
this bill comes up year after year after
 
02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
year and the answers are are pretty much
 
02:14:58.390 --> 02:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
do you use um
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
do you recommend charitynavigators.org
 
02:15:05.830 --> 02:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
to anybody um we were having a
 
02:15:10.149 --> 02:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
discussion about um solicitation from
 
02:15:10.159 --> 02:15:11.750 align:start position:0%
discussion about um solicitation from
charities

02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
charities
 
02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:13.430 align:start position:0%
charities
i

02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
so i i'm not familiar with that website
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
but what i can say is that there if
 
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
there are any concerns about charities
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire the
 
02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
department of justice has a charitable
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
trusts unit
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
that is that's what they do is they
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
register and regulate charities within
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire so any
 
02:15:33.669 --> 02:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
questions about the legitimacy of a
 
02:15:33.679 --> 02:15:35.350 align:start position:0%
questions about the legitimacy of a
charity

02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
charity
 
02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:37.599 align:start position:0%
you can contact our charitable trust
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%

that's what they do i'm sure that they
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
would be and i would i would i'm
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable recommending that you do
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
that instead of relying on the web
 
02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
website that you recommended might be
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
great i've never been to it um
 
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
used it for years uh they they um
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
they rate charities but that's uh aside
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
from the point of this bill
 
02:15:59.119 --> 02:15:59.910 align:start position:0%
from the point of this bill
um

02:15:59.910 --> 02:15:59.920 align:start position:0%

you identified that we already have laws
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
in place
 
02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:11.109 align:start position:0%
in place

they're really are you um

annoyance

02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
annoyance
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
i mean for in many cases
 
02:16:43.110 --> 02:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
when by the time it gets to you
 
02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's a crime
 
02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
but for a lot of us
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
this is an
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
annoyance that goes on day after day
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
do you have any suggestions on how we
 
02:16:57.990 --> 02:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
can talk to our constituents that this
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
may not be
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
a law that we can
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
practically make
 
02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:05.669 align:start position:0%
practically make
but

02:17:05.669 --> 02:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
other than
 
02:17:09.509 --> 02:17:09.519 align:start position:0%
you know not picking up the phone
 
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
um when we're all
 
02:17:14.309 --> 02:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
we're all tempted to pick up the phone
 
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
even when we don't know
 
02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
who it is behind it depending on the day
 
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know like you just said you picked
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
up one on the way home way away to work
 
02:17:23.910 --> 02:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
this morning um
 
02:17:25.030 --> 02:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
is there anything we can tell our
 
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
constituents to say
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
we can't really make a bill on make a
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:33.359 --> 02:17:34.709 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:17:34.709 --> 02:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:37.110 --> 02:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say that you can't make a law
 
02:17:38.709 --> 02:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
because that implies that there's
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
nothing that the law can do to address
 
02:17:42.309 --> 02:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
this and again you know there are
 
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
already current laws on the books that
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
address this
 
02:17:48.309 --> 02:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
i don't i think it may be more accurate
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
to say that there is no quick
 
02:17:52.629 --> 02:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
legislative fix that can be enacted that
 
02:17:54.389 --> 02:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
will make a significant impact on this
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
problem the calls are going to keep
 
02:17:55.920 --> 02:17:58.230 align:start position:0%
problem the calls are going to keep
coming

02:17:58.230 --> 02:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
coming
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
but there is a definite correlation and
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:18:02.950 --> 02:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
given that you know i answered a call
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
this morning i i
 
02:18:05.910 --> 02:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the temptation to answer
 
02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
your phone
 
02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
but there is a definite correlation
 
02:18:11.669 --> 02:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
between how often you answer your phone
 
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
and how many robo calls you get
 
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's very interesting i wondered that
 
02:18:18.389 --> 02:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
myself okay i am not nobody can be
 
02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
certain exactly how it works
 
02:18:23.110 --> 02:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
but those who frequently answer
 
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
robocalls seem to be on a list
 
02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
of targets people that because this is
 
02:18:30.309 --> 02:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunately
 
02:18:32.549 --> 02:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
it's a full-time job for people that are
 
02:18:34.469 --> 02:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
engaging in these scams they have made a
 
02:18:36.790 --> 02:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
career out of taking advantage of people
 
02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
and like any you know
 
02:18:40.950 --> 02:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
like marketing like business like like
 
02:18:43.429 --> 02:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
anything your target population are
 
02:18:46.150 --> 02:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
those who are most likely to
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
subscribe to your business in this case
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
the business of fraud um people that
 
02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
aren't answering the call aren't worth
 
02:18:54.549 --> 02:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
the same amount of calls as people that
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
are answering the calls so if you're
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
flagged as somebody who is a likely
 
02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
on the phone person because if they can
 
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
get you on the phone they can convince
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
you of anything if they can't get you on
 
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
the phone they have absolutely no power
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
to do anything to you it's just as you
 
02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
said it's an annoyance because your
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
phone is ringing and it's it's annoying
 
02:19:15.990 --> 02:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
i mean there's no other way to put it
 
02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:17.110 align:start position:0%
i mean there's no other way to put it
but

02:19:17.110 --> 02:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
if you can
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
adjust your practices
 
02:19:22.870 --> 02:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
so that you
 
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
are not picking up the phone unless you
 
02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
recognize the number or you're exp you
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
know obviously there's exceptions if
 
02:19:29.349 --> 02:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
you're expecting a call and you're not
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
sure what the number the call is going
 
02:19:32.830 --> 02:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
to be coming from and it might be an
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
emergency you have to answer the call
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
but in any other circumstances if it's
 
02:19:36.719 --> 02:19:38.070 align:start position:0%
but in any other circumstances if it's
important

02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:19:39.429 --> 02:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
they're going to leave a message and you
 
02:19:41.110 --> 02:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
can call them back and you can even
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
confirm that you know whoever it is that
 
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
might be calling you
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
if it's somebody spoofing them or
 
02:19:48.790 --> 02:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
pretending to be somebody else you can
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
look up the number independently and
 
02:19:52.710 --> 02:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
call the number that you know and trust
 
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
if you adjust your cell phone use or
 
02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
your home phone use to subscribe to that
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
theory which is that you don't
 
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
answer a phone call you don't recognize
 
02:20:02.070 --> 02:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
the number four
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
you let it go to voicemail if it's
 
02:20:05.110 --> 02:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
important enough they'll leave a
 
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
voicemail and you don't trust the number
 
02:20:09.750 --> 02:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
on the voicemail necessarily but you
 
02:20:12.630 --> 02:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
call back you know your known number for
 
02:20:13.990 --> 02:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
that person
 
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
or that business
 
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
i think you will see that the number of
 
02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
robocalls that you as an individual get
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
go down it has worked with me
 
02:20:24.309 --> 02:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
um i get it i have a state issued cell
 
02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
phone here
 
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
when i first got it i got three times
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
the amount of calls on my state-ish
 
02:20:32.070 --> 02:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire issued cell phone
 
02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
that i got on my personal phone
 
02:20:35.590 --> 02:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
and because i was i'd love to tell the
 
02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
story so i'm glad i have the opportunity
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
to tell a story you know when when i
 
02:20:41.110 --> 02:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
started here at the attorney general's
 
02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:42.070 align:start position:0%
started here at the attorney general's
office

02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know you're a little bit in awe of
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
working for the department of justice
 
02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
it's a big responsibility we do a lot of
 
02:20:48.870 --> 02:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
work there are a lot of really great
 
02:20:50.309 --> 02:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
lawyers here so you really want to do a
 
02:20:52.630 --> 02:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
good job so they give you the cell phone
 
02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
and you get all these 271 you know which
 
02:20:58.630 --> 02:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
is the state extension recalls
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
and it says conquered and you're getting
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
these calls all the time so i feel
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
obligated you know i what if this is the
 
02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
attorney general calling me right now he
 
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
has something he wants me to work i have
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
to answer this call so anthony's false
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
it was i wasn't important enough at that
 
02:21:13.990 --> 02:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
point nobody ever called me nobody even
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
knew the number you know i was just some
 
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
peon that had been assigned a random
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
cell phone number but i kept answering
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
it and i kept getting these calls
 
02:21:22.469 --> 02:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
eventually i got comfortable enough in
 
02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
my position here that i realized that
 
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know if the attorney general wants
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
to talk to me he's probably not going to
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
call my cell phone he's just going to
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
ask him to come up to his office or
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
anybody else here same thing so i
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
stopped answering the phone
 
02:21:33.670 --> 02:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
if i didn't recognize the number if it
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't a number that was programmed in
 
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
my phone i just did not answer the call

phone
 
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm not surprised that it's an
 
02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
out-of-state number or whatever
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
because of what i do and all the things
 
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
i do
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh in my life um and and you have
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
friends that uh moved to arizona and
 
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
keep a new hampshire number i answer the
 
02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
phone and i'm just wondering i've i've
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
always thought that there's certain
 
02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
things you can do
 
02:22:33.429 --> 02:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
to at least mitigate
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
the potential
 
02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
harm that may be done to you and i just
 
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
wondered if if
 
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
your opinion on
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
for instance i've always been told don't
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
say yes oh boy don't say yes um as an
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
answer to to the person because they can
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
take that as a commitment
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
or um
 
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
or ask them some questions
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
or like someone said uh please send me a
 
02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
request in the mail
 
02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:00.950 align:start position:0%
request in the mail
um

02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
what do you suggest as things to do to
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
to help protect yourself from having
 
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
signed up for something or
 
02:23:11.830 --> 02:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
expose yourself to some sort of harm
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
well again my
 
02:23:15.190 --> 02:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
my number one recommendation would be to
 
02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
not answer the phone
 
02:23:17.910 --> 02:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know if it's your friend from
 
02:23:19.270 --> 02:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
arizona that's kept a new hampshire
 
02:23:20.309 --> 02:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
number and they're trying to get in
 
02:23:21.270 --> 02:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
touch with you they'll leave you a
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
message and ask you to call back
 
02:23:25.750 --> 02:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
if you answer the phone
 
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
you never know
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
what information you're going to
 
02:23:30.389 --> 02:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
inadvertently give them that will give
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
them the power to take advantage of it
 
02:23:33.359 --> 02:23:34.550 align:start position:0%
them the power to take advantage of it
however

02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
if you uh insist on answering the phone
 
02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
and you're going to continue to answer
 
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
the phone
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
all you can do is be aware that if you
 
02:23:44.469 --> 02:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
don't recognize the number there's a
 
02:23:46.630 --> 02:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
very high probability that the person on
 
02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
the other end of the line is a scammer
 
02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
anybody that you want
 
02:23:53.670 --> 02:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
to get calls from that you trust put
 
02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
them into your cell phone so that it
 
02:23:56.950 --> 02:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
comes up you can trust that's the person
 
02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
calling and then if any time you're
 
02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
getting a call from any number that's
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
not a trusted number in your contacts on
 
02:24:05.510 --> 02:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
your phone just be suspicious
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
be aware that anything you say you know
 
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
may create
 
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
problems for you down the road any
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
information you give even if it seems
 
02:24:15.270 --> 02:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
harmless at the time could be part of a
 
02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
bigger scam that is specifically
 
02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
designed to get you to say yes or to
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
give information that you know seems
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
harmless at the time but is going to be
 
02:24:23.429 --> 02:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
used against you in ways that you can't
 
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
even imagine
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
these scammers are very good at what
 
02:24:29.990 --> 02:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
they do it's very high tech and it's
 
02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
very complicated and you know they're
 
02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
they've made a whole business out of
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
this but
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
if you're aware and you're educated
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
about the likelihood that somebody else
 
02:24:41.910 --> 02:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
is trying to scam you and you either
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
don't answer the phone or you say as
 
02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
little as possible and get off the call
 
02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible that's the best
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
but again i i highly recommend
 
02:24:58.150 --> 02:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
taking the time to
 
02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
really use the contacts feature on your
 
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
phone and put anybody that you expect to
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
get a call from in the near at any point
 
02:25:05.910 --> 02:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
in the future that's a trusted source
 
02:25:07.270 --> 02:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
put their number into your phone
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
manually so that when you get a call
 
02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
from that person you'll know that it's
 
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
them and you can answer that phone with
 
02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:16.630 align:start position:0%
them and you can answer that phone with
confidence

02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the discussion so far has
 
02:25:55.270 --> 02:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
been centered on
 
02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
cell phones um
 
02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
which had have tools on them
 
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
um to
 
02:26:04.710 --> 02:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
like the
 
02:26:07.270 --> 02:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
previous testifier was describing
 
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
to um block stuff which i i do use on my
 
02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
cell phone but i'd just like to
 
02:26:16.469 --> 02:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
remind people of um
 
02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
that that there are still people with
 
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
landlines out there i live in an
 
02:26:24.630 --> 02:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
apartment building i represent concord
 
02:26:26.389 --> 02:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
ward 6 which is merrimack county
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
district 15.
 
02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:30.309 align:start position:0%
district 15.
so

02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
i live in an apartment building where
 
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're required to have landlines
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
buzz people in at the door when they
 
02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
call up
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:26:45.670 --> 02:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
on the landline you don't have as you
 
02:26:47.429 --> 02:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
don't have the same tools you on a cell
 
02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
phone to block robocallers
 
02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:52.710 align:start position:0%
phone to block robocallers
um

02:26:52.710 --> 02:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:54.710 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:26:54.710 --> 02:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:56.309 --> 02:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
it's also
 
02:26:58.550 --> 02:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
also you can't put it on silence or
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
anything so you have that buzzer
 
02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
ringer going off so that's like another
 
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
effect of it
 
02:27:08.790 --> 02:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:27:11.110 --> 02:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to
 
02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
remind people of the effect it has on
 
02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
people with land
 
02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:21.429 --> 02:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
great fair enough
 
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
you have any questions from any
 
02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
committee members seeing none
 
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
we thank you very much
 
02:27:31.110 --> 02:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
okay so now we have some
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill
 
02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:36.070 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill
and

02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%

with over 450 000 customers
 
02:28:47.710 --> 02:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
served in more than
 
02:28:50.230 --> 02:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
184 communities
 
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
although this bill is very well intended
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
our comments today are in opposition for
 
02:28:57.750 --> 02:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
two main reasons
 
02:29:00.950 --> 02:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
first we believe the bill is unnecessary
 
02:29:04.230 --> 02:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
given substantial efforts by the fcc
 
02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:05.590 align:start position:0%
given substantial efforts by the fcc
ftc

02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
ftc
 
02:29:07.750 --> 02:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
u.s department of justice the state's
 
02:29:09.270 --> 02:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys general
 
02:29:11.670 --> 02:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
and providers to fight malicious
 
02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:13.349 align:start position:0%
and providers to fight malicious
robocalling

02:29:13.349 --> 02:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
robocalling
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
second the bill has technical flaws
 
02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
given subjective standards some
 
02:29:20.870 --> 02:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
confusing definitions
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
and we believe unintended consequences
 
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
of perhaps making even
 
02:29:27.429 --> 02:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
routine calls illegal
 
02:29:29.349 --> 02:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
and also preventing the use of certain
 
02:29:31.270 --> 02:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
privacy features
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
that some consumers find important
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
we've submitted written testimony um for
 
02:29:39.270 --> 02:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
your review and the record
 
02:29:42.389 --> 02:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
and it outlines in much greater detail
 
02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
the protections that are currently in
 
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
place and that have been adopted by
 
02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
voice service providers together with
 
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
state and federal criminal and civil
 
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
to combat unwanted solicitations
 
02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
necta members for example
 
02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
have worked to develop and deploy
 
02:30:05.270 --> 02:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
advanced robocall mitigation tools
 
02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
this goes to representative herbert's
 
02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
question earlier
 
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
where he notes that he gets a spam
 
02:30:13.830 --> 02:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
technical standards developed by
 
02:30:17.429 --> 02:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
industry and now required
 
02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
by federal regulators lays the
 
02:30:21.030 --> 02:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
technology groundwork for industry
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
efforts to fight these calls
 
02:30:26.710 --> 02:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
and comcast engineers specifically
 
02:30:29.030 --> 02:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
pioneered what's called
 
02:30:30.830 --> 02:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
the stir shaken
 
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
framework which was certified to the fcc
 
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
virtually all residential phone calls
 
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
originating on the comcast network
 
02:30:44.070 --> 02:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
include this technology
 
02:30:44.080 --> 02:30:45.510 align:start position:0%
include this technology
and

02:30:45.510 --> 02:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
it is fully integrated with uh at least
 
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
12 voice providers including 18t verizon
 
02:30:53.670 --> 02:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
t-mobile sprint and others
 
02:30:53.680 --> 02:30:54.550 align:start position:0%
t-mobile sprint and others
now

02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
what is stir shaken
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
it is a little bit um beyond my pay
 
02:31:01.910 --> 02:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
grade and we do include information
 
02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
about that in our written remarks but
 
02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
the bottom line
 
02:31:06.870 --> 02:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
is that stir shaken
 
02:31:10.230 --> 02:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
digitally validates the handoff of phone
 
02:31:10.240 --> 02:31:11.110 align:start position:0%
digitally validates the handoff of phone
calls

02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
calls
 
02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
passing through the complex web of
 
02:31:17.670 --> 02:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
networks allowing the phone company
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
of the consumer receiving the call
 
02:31:23.110 --> 02:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
to verify that a call is in fact from
 
02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
the number displayed on caller id
 
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
our written remarks also explain efforts
 
02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
underway at the federal level
 
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh including the fcc
 
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
the ftc and the u.s department of
 
02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.150 align:start position:0%
the ftc and the u.s department of
justice

02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
justice
 
02:31:40.870 --> 02:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
for example in 2019 congress passed the
 
02:31:42.790 --> 02:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
telephone robocall abuse criminal
 
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement and deterrence act referred
 
02:31:46.710 --> 02:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
to as traced
 
02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
this is just one effort suffice it to
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
say that
 
02:31:52.630 --> 02:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
collective federal interagency
 
02:31:54.790 --> 02:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
collaborations along with industry
 
02:31:56.630 --> 02:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
partners have resulted in
 
02:31:58.950 --> 02:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
very important civil actions
 
02:32:02.389 --> 02:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
taken against illegal robocalls
 
02:32:04.150 --> 02:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
in recent years the fcc has taken
 
02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
significant enforcement actions totaling
 
02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
over 450
 
02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.750 align:start position:0%
over 450
million

02:32:09.750 --> 02:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
dollars against telemarketers for
 
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
apparent illegal caller id spoofing
 
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's just one example and i will
 
02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
reference you to our written remarks for
 
02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:18.550 align:start position:0%
reference you to our written remarks for
more

02:32:18.550 --> 02:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:32:21.830 --> 02:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
background on trace and
 
02:32:24.389 --> 02:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
legal actions taken at the federal
 
02:32:24.399 --> 02:32:27.910 align:start position:0%
legal actions taken at the federal
level

02:32:27.910 --> 02:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:31.110 --> 02:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
and as attorney gerard pointed out
 
02:32:32.950 --> 02:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
we have our industry has worked closely
 
02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
with states attorneys general
 
02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
all 50 states and 12 major voice service
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
providers have announced a set of
 
02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:42.550 align:start position:0%
providers have announced a set of
anti-robocall

02:32:42.550 --> 02:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
anti-robocall
 
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
principles that they've agreed to
 
02:32:44.160 --> 02:32:45.190 align:start position:0%
principles that they've agreed to
implement

02:32:45.190 --> 02:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
implement
 
02:32:47.429 --> 02:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
or continue to implement for combating
 
02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
illegal and unwanted robocalls and those
 
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
principles are also outlined in my
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
written remarks i won't take your time
 
02:32:57.910 --> 02:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
to go through those
 
02:32:59.750 --> 02:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
we acknowledge that there remain an
 
02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
unacceptable number of illegal robocalls
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
but there are robust ongoing efforts
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
as i've explained at the federal level
 
02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
and the state level and with industry to
 
02:33:13.270 --> 02:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
mitigate these calls
 
02:33:15.270 --> 02:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
to my second point we believe that there
 
02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
are some significant technical flaws in
 
02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:33:21.270 --> 02:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
first the bill
 
02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
really imposes subjective standards
 
02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:26.630 align:start position:0%
really imposes subjective standards
um

02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:29.110 --> 02:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know it uses an unwanted standard
 
02:33:31.030 --> 02:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
for id and robocalls and i could walk
 
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
you through some of the technical issues
 
02:33:35.110 --> 02:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
again i won't take your time
 
02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
but those subjective standards
 
02:33:38.479 --> 02:33:39.910 align:start position:0%
but those subjective standards
uh

02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:40.710 align:start position:0%
uh
make

02:33:40.710 --> 02:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
this law difficult to comply with
 
02:33:45.110 --> 02:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
difficult to enforce
 
02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:47.190 align:start position:0%
difficult to enforce
etc

02:33:47.190 --> 02:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
etc
 
02:33:49.270 --> 02:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
further the bill substantially rewrites
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
02:33:53.670 --> 02:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
related to the do not call list and we
 
02:33:55.830 --> 02:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
believe that this diminishes the focus
 
02:33:57.750 --> 02:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
on malicious robocalls
 
02:34:00.389 --> 02:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
confuses consumers and potentially
 
02:34:02.710 --> 02:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
potentially criminalizes legitimate
 
02:34:05.830 --> 02:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
commercial activity
 
02:34:08.469 --> 02:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
in fact some of the definitions are just
 
02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
they're not consistent with current new
 
02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire law or for example there's a
 
02:34:15.349 --> 02:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
definition of telephone corporation
 
02:34:16.950 --> 02:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
which is not currently a defined or
 
02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
recognized term under new hampshire law
 
02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
lastly we think that there are
 
02:34:24.790 --> 02:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
significant unintended consequences
 
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
i have mentioned that this could
 
02:34:28.830 --> 02:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
potentially make routine calls
 
02:34:31.990 --> 02:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
illegal um and and also
 
02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
many consumers like to use privacy
 
02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
settings on their phones
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's for
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
health reasons family domestic issues um
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
and so we think that this bill would
 
02:34:48.790 --> 02:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
actually prohibit the use of that call
 
02:34:51.429 --> 02:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
blocking technology so for all of these
 
02:34:51.439 --> 02:34:52.630 align:start position:0%
blocking technology so for all of these
reasons

02:34:52.630 --> 02:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
02:34:54.389 --> 02:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
um we believe that this law is
 
02:34:56.710 --> 02:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary we urge you to recommend it
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and in general
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
creating a patchwork of state robocall
 
02:35:02.399 --> 02:35:04.150 align:start position:0%
creating a patchwork of state robocall
rules

02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
would be costly
 
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
create unnecessary burdens and not
 
02:35:10.389 --> 02:35:10.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily protect the consumers who we
 
02:35:10.399 --> 02:35:11.349 align:start position:0%
necessarily protect the consumers who we
all

02:35:11.349 --> 02:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:35:13.190 --> 02:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
value so with that i thank you for your
 
02:35:15.190 --> 02:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
time i'm happy to try to answer any
 
02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:17.429 align:start position:0%
time i'm happy to try to answer any
questions

02:35:17.429 --> 02:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:35:19.270 --> 02:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much
 
02:35:20.950 --> 02:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions from the
 
02:35:24.870 --> 02:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
see now i guess they're pretty
 
02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
questioned out i guess for
 
02:35:30.150 --> 02:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
with the attorney
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:35:33.349 --> 02:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:33.359 --> 02:35:34.309 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

02:35:34.309 --> 02:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
i'll look over the attendees list or
 
02:35:38.790 --> 02:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else would like to speak
 
02:35:40.790 --> 02:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:41.990 align:start position:0%
on this bill
um

02:35:41.990 --> 02:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
i would um
 
02:35:45.910 --> 02:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative bartlett do you
 
02:35:48.790 --> 02:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
remember liz elizabeth hager liz hager
 
02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
the representative of course
 
02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
so liz hager
 
02:35:53.910 --> 02:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's been a while she's been around i
 
02:35:55.270 --> 02:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
think she's like the last republican
 
02:35:57.190 --> 02:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
that came out of concord but
 
02:35:59.830 --> 02:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i think you're right
 
02:36:02.710 --> 02:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
she actually put in uh legislation
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
02:36:05.910 --> 02:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
unions of the fire department as you get
 
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
those fire calls and police associations
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
associations and it's her legislation
 
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
that did uh require them to register
 
02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general's office um
 
02:36:21.429 --> 02:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
and that's been on the books so let's
 
02:36:23.910 --> 02:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
say for a long time uh so those all all
 
02:36:25.590 --> 02:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
those organizations when you get a call
 
02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
you say why are you why are these people
 
02:36:29.030 --> 02:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
calling me i'm on the do not call list
 
02:36:31.110 --> 02:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
but uh as you probably know nonprofits
 
02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
are exempt right not call us so that's
 
02:36:35.110 --> 02:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
interesting because of course she was
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
mayor of concord too
 
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's right i forgot to see he wasn't
 
02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.670 align:start position:0%
that's right i forgot to see he wasn't
there

02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
so so they that we do have that statute
 
02:36:45.590 --> 02:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
um and the um
 
02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:46.389 align:start position:0%
um and the um
uh

02:36:46.389 --> 02:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:36:48.950 --> 02:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
tom donovan because he he did mention
 
02:36:51.030 --> 02:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
the charitable trust division they
 
02:36:53.349 --> 02:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
actually did at one point i put a list
 
02:36:55.270 --> 02:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
together of all these organizations that
 
02:36:57.990 --> 02:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
were doing fundraising for phone call
 
02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
fundraising type things
 
02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
and um and they were actually they were
 
02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
interested is how much money actually
 
02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
went to the charity itself yeah and it
 
02:37:07.910 --> 02:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
turned out that some of them was like
 
02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
ten percent it was really uh yeah well
 
02:37:11.910 --> 02:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's what charity navigators
 
02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
helps you with it tells you how much
 
02:37:15.309 --> 02:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
goes it's
 
02:37:15.319 --> 02:37:16.870 align:start position:0%
goes it's
charitynavigator.org

02:37:16.870 --> 02:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
charitynavigator.org
 
02:37:19.270 --> 02:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
and it's a non-profit that rates
 
02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:20.309 align:start position:0%
and it's a non-profit that rates
charities

02:37:20.309 --> 02:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
charities
 
02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
exactly and uh so i would like to be
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
sure everybody knows that when you get a
 
02:37:26.550 --> 02:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
fireman's association because i thought
 
02:37:28.230 --> 02:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
it was weird because i know my little
 
02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
podunk town you know we don't our fire
 
02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
department is not unionized so why would
 
02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
they i'd be giving to a farmer's
 
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
association but but they are they are
 
02:37:38.469 --> 02:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
going to be registered in the state so
 
02:37:41.590 --> 02:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
they are registered um but even when we
 
02:37:43.990 --> 02:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
get to the question of charitables and
 
02:37:45.190 --> 02:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
no and you're asking about how do you
 
02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
know terrible so any charity that's in
 
02:37:49.990 --> 02:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire if anyone who wants is a
 
02:37:53.190 --> 02:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
501c or a charitable trust still has to
 
02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
register with the secretary of state's
 
02:37:59.190 --> 02:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
office right so anytime you have an
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
who they are organizat they're fuzzy or
 
02:38:01.990 --> 02:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
whether they really exist or at least
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
like who learns a direct phone number
 
02:38:06.070 --> 02:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
contact information actually you
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't go to the ag's office you would
 
02:38:09.910 --> 02:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
go to the secretary of state's office
 
02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:10.630 align:start position:0%
go to the secretary of state's office
and

02:38:10.630 --> 02:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:13.270 --> 02:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
the business look up and you can then
 
02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
type in that name and you can find that
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
charity and you can find out um who the
 
02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
treasurer president is and some contact
 
02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
information uh right
 
02:38:23.910 --> 02:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know what i highly recommend using
 
02:38:25.349 --> 02:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
that as a resource
 
02:38:26.950 --> 02:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
for so many of us that are on so many
 
02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
non-profit boards we know that there's a
 
02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know a charge and we have to make
 
02:38:32.790 --> 02:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
sure that our treasurer remembers to
 
02:38:34.710 --> 02:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
right just renew the registration each
 
02:38:37.110 --> 02:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
and every dollars
 
02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
yes they have to do it so but at least
 
02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
it gives a instead of asking the ag's
 
02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
office which clearly they're over
 
02:38:45.429 --> 02:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
overworked and clearly yeah
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
i have to tell you that i mean that
 
02:38:51.429 --> 02:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
that ag that attorney um
 
02:38:53.750 --> 02:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
is so patient yeah because they when we
 
02:38:55.910 --> 02:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
get the same questions year after year
 
02:38:57.670 --> 02:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
after year on this bill
 
02:39:00.870 --> 02:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and he's very good at
 
02:39:03.030 --> 02:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
it coming prepared which is wonderful
 
02:39:05.590 --> 02:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
for us i would have to say that uh he
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
very well as well very well prepared on
 
02:39:08.309 --> 02:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
02:39:09.670 --> 02:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not gonna take anything away
 
02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
from the previous people who have been
 
02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
at that job but no no but he he did he
 
02:39:16.070 --> 02:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
did have he did do his homework and
 
02:39:19.750 --> 02:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay so uh otherwise we're all set for
 
02:39:25.270 --> 02:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
this morning and
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh we have our last two bills for
 
02:39:30.150 --> 02:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
hearings uh this afternoon starting at 1
 
02:39:32.870 --> 02:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
30 so oh we're going to get plenty of
 
02:39:34.710 --> 02:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
plenty of testimony on this one to go
 
02:39:36.469 --> 02:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
skiing and
 
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
shoveling or whatever activities you
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
still want to do um and but it looks

she's um
 
04:25:25.990 --> 04:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
evidently her microphone or speaker's
 
04:25:43.750 --> 04:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
i just sent her an email suggested
 
04:25:50.389 --> 04:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
i said we can all hear each other
 
04:25:54.389 --> 04:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
because we can hear each other yeah
 
04:25:56.229 --> 04:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
right obviously her
 
04:25:58.469 --> 04:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
some things
 
04:26:10.389 --> 04:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
but i'm still around
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
yeah no problem
 
04:26:17.189 --> 04:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
i'm surprised to see so many bills that
 
04:26:20.870 --> 04:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:20.880 --> 04:26:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:26:21.830 --> 04:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:26:25.750 --> 04:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:27.990 --> 04:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
what what i always said i try to
 
04:26:29.429 --> 04:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
emphasize to people when they want to
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
put a bill in
 
04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
the first thing to do is contact
 
04:26:33.910 --> 04:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
somebody look up the committee that the
 
04:26:35.590 --> 04:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
bill go would go to
 
04:26:37.110 --> 04:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
and look on that committee for somebody
 
04:26:38.309 --> 04:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know don't have to call necessarily
 
04:26:42.309 --> 04:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
the chairman but but call somebody and
 
04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
get get the dope and what you know
 
04:26:46.710 --> 04:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
what's the story why this bill you know
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
why it is
 
04:26:49.910 --> 04:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
yeah because it just seems sad that the
 
04:26:51.590 --> 04:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
same people have to come and testify
 
04:26:53.590 --> 04:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
year after year on the same bill i mean
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
it seems like a waste of time for people
 
04:26:56.640 --> 04:26:57.510 align:start position:0%
it seems like a waste of time for people
yeah

04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:26:59.590 --> 04:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
got it
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
but then again there's some people who
 
04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
want mandatory auto insurance and will
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
keep coming back
 
04:27:07.590 --> 04:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't i didn't bring it up
 
04:27:07.600 --> 04:27:09.910 align:start position:0%
i didn't i didn't bring it up
right

04:27:09.910 --> 04:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:11.590 --> 04:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'm very surprised that you support
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
raising the limits because that's really
 
04:27:15.189 --> 04:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
going to make it unaffordable for for
 
04:27:18.149 --> 04:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
people who have sketchy driving you know
 
04:27:19.510 --> 04:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
i mean maybe they're maybe they don't
 
04:27:22.149 --> 04:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
have an sr22 but let's just say they're
 
04:27:23.510 --> 04:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know that you know they have some
 
04:27:26.469 --> 04:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
underwriting criteria issues and now
 
04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
that now that if you raise those we
 
04:27:29.670 --> 04:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
raise those limits they won't be able to
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
afford it
 
04:27:32.229 --> 04:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
and then you'll have less people with
 
04:27:32.239 --> 04:27:34.149 align:start position:0%
and then you'll have less people with
insurance

04:27:34.149 --> 04:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:27:36.070 --> 04:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'm just shocked i'm just shocked that
 
04:27:38.469 --> 04:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
you i know and i it's important that i
 
04:27:41.349 --> 04:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
shock you occasionally
 
04:27:43.030 --> 04:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
john if somebody keeps bringing the same
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
bill in every single year just turn it
 
04:27:47.590 --> 04:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
into a study committee an ongoing study
 
04:27:50.309 --> 04:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
committee and put them on it
 
04:27:51.670 --> 04:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
the chapter said i can't know they might
 
04:27:52.830 --> 04:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
like that
 
04:27:54.630 --> 04:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
no know
 
04:27:55.990 --> 04:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
you might want that they might think
 
04:27:57.750 --> 04:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
this is great i got an excuse to go
 
04:27:57.760 --> 04:27:59.990 align:start position:0%
this is great i got an excuse to go
ahead

04:27:59.990 --> 04:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
04:28:00.000 --> 04:28:01.189 align:start position:0%
ahead
no

04:28:01.189 --> 04:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:28:01.199 --> 04:28:02.710 align:start position:0%
no
no

04:28:02.710 --> 04:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:28:05.110 --> 04:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
i just wish people would call somebody
 
04:28:06.469 --> 04:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
on that committee that when they're
 
04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
putting a bill and get the dope on it
 
04:28:10.870 --> 04:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
you know yeah at least get the history
 
04:28:13.309 --> 04:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
of what was said previously and what the
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
determinations were and everything it's
 
04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
not like that isn't available
 
04:28:20.149 --> 04:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
i send her a long email
 
04:28:21.670 --> 04:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's a rookie
 
04:28:21.680 --> 04:28:22.870 align:start position:0%
you know it's a rookie
issue

04:28:22.870 --> 04:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:28:22.880 --> 04:28:23.990 align:start position:0%
issue
um

04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:25.830 --> 04:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
and you know she
 
04:28:27.910 --> 04:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
she said thanks for being patient she
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
thought ols took care of things like
 
04:28:32.309 --> 04:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
this she really didn't know how to bring
 
04:28:34.950 --> 04:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:36.550 --> 04:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe we could maybe we could talk
 
04:28:39.510 --> 04:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
to uh ols uh regarding you know these
 
04:28:41.110 --> 04:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
bills that come back every year or every
 
04:28:43.990 --> 04:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
two years you know to inform the
 
04:28:45.910 --> 04:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
the representatives that may be wanting
 
04:28:47.910 --> 04:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
to put in the same bill maybe it could
 
04:28:50.790 --> 04:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
be flagged i don't know
 
04:28:52.070 --> 04:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's their job to
 
04:28:52.080 --> 04:28:53.429 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's their job to
discourage

04:28:53.429 --> 04:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
discourage
 
04:28:55.830 --> 04:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
um sponsors from bringing yeah that's
 
04:28:57.990 --> 04:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
yeah no but it would be helpful if they
 
04:28:59.830 --> 04:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
at least told them that there had been a
 
04:29:01.830 --> 04:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
bill so they can go look up the records
 
04:29:03.670 --> 04:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
and the testimony and everything and see
 
04:29:05.750 --> 04:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
what the objections were and you know
 
04:29:06.870 --> 04:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
what i mean they would be better
 
04:29:09.030 --> 04:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
prepared they'd write a better bill but
 
04:29:12.149 --> 04:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
that's what the sponsor should do
 
04:29:14.710 --> 04:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
their homework yeah exactly yeah well
 
04:29:16.070 --> 04:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think yeah
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
on the committee but you know i i don't
 
04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
i tell people all the time please call
 
04:29:21.429 --> 04:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
me in any issue that coming through
 
04:29:23.990 --> 04:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
commerce please call me exactly and
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's what i said too in her and you
 
04:29:27.910 --> 04:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
know i tried to be gentle
 
04:29:30.149 --> 04:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
04:29:32.309 --> 04:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
i also told her that it wasn't up to ols
 
04:29:33.990 --> 04:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
to do the research
 
04:29:36.309 --> 04:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
um regarding the history of the bill it
 
04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
was really up to the sponsor to look it
 
04:29:40.389 --> 04:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
up and i know that it's difficult the
 
04:29:42.469 --> 04:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
lob is not open and all that but you
 
04:29:43.910 --> 04:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
know when you sponsor a bill you usually
 
04:29:48.309 --> 04:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
but it was a wasted morning
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:57.189 --> 04:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
you didn't think i was going to take a
 
04:30:00.389 --> 04:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
different position on that did you i i
 
04:30:01.750 --> 04:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
don't know let's see which one like
 
04:30:01.760 --> 04:30:02.950 align:start position:0%
don't know let's see which one like
maybe

04:30:02.950 --> 04:30:02.960 align:start position:0%

04:30:04.710 --> 04:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
04:30:06.389 --> 04:30:06.399 align:start position:0%

04:30:08.309 --> 04:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
two sponsors not show up that didn't

help yeah yeah yeah
 
04:30:12.870 --> 04:30:12.880 align:start position:0%

and you know and i said to him i said i
 
04:32:32.229 --> 04:32:32.239 align:start position:0%

will profile where were they where would
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
be the other the people who were opposed
 
04:32:37.590 --> 04:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
to what are the people who have service
 
04:32:37.600 --> 04:32:38.790 align:start position:0%

right
 
04:32:41.910 --> 04:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
they came in and said it's distracting
 
04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%

uh i pulled the files on those
 
04:32:50.389 --> 04:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of reasons why we don't
 
04:32:52.469 --> 04:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
want dogs in restaurants
 
04:32:55.830 --> 04:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
well i don't necessarily agree with you
 
04:32:57.590 --> 04:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's outdoors
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
the service dogs can stay inside they
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
don't need to go outside i don't know
 
04:33:04.310 --> 04:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
come on so this is covered
 
04:33:06.789 --> 04:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
well i'm post covered i'm sorry i'm not
 
04:33:08.789 --> 04:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
i'm not going out to restaurants i'm
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
period yeah right exactly who's going to
 
04:33:11.039 --> 04:33:12.949 align:start position:0%
period yeah right exactly who's going to
restaurants

04:33:12.949 --> 04:33:12.959 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:33:16.150 --> 04:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh so i guess we're not getting anywhere
 
04:33:16.160 --> 04:33:19.189 align:start position:0%
uh so i guess we're not getting anywhere
here

04:33:19.189 --> 04:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:22.230 --> 04:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
and he signed up twice too
 
04:33:22.240 --> 04:33:23.429 align:start position:0%
and he signed up twice too
um

04:33:23.429 --> 04:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:26.551 --> 04:33:26.561 align:start position:0%
all right uh let's see i have
 
04:33:27.910 --> 04:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
can't be too serious about it if he
 
04:33:29.349 --> 04:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up
 
04:33:31.590 --> 04:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
he's there he could he's obviously there
 
04:33:33.269 --> 04:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
he just needs to reboot himself or
 
04:33:35.590 --> 04:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
something but he's going whoop he's gone
 
04:33:37.990 --> 04:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
now he's rebooting himself he heard me
 
04:33:38.000 --> 04:33:39.109 align:start position:0%
now he's rebooting himself he heard me
good

04:33:39.109 --> 04:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay there he is there he is
 
04:33:45.029 --> 04:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
okay so now uh we you
 
04:33:46.629 --> 04:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
i didn't i could barely hear you want to
 
04:33:50.070 --> 04:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
talk louder let me see if i can hear you
 
04:33:52.150 --> 04:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
no i cannot hear you
 
04:33:54.551 --> 04:33:54.561 align:start position:0%
so it's not that you're muted i don't
 
04:33:56.629 --> 04:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
know your microphone is not picking up
 
04:33:59.109 --> 04:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
what are you using for a microphone
 
04:34:00.629 --> 04:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
that's what i had done i had turned off
 
04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
my microphone on my computer can you oh
 
04:34:06.551 --> 04:34:06.561 align:start position:0%
really you can do that oh yeah
 
04:34:08.949 --> 04:34:08.959 align:start position:0%
just the icon down at the bottom
 
04:34:11.590 --> 04:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
but isn't that the mute button no
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
no no that's your microphone
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
so you must be a p is that pcs because i
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
don't have that on my list
 
04:34:17.359 --> 04:34:18.629 align:start position:0%
don't have that on my list
yeah

04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:34:19.830 --> 04:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
yeah because i don't have that on my
 
04:34:22.869 --> 04:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
back i don't i can't do that
 
04:34:24.551 --> 04:34:24.561 align:start position:0%
there's no chat so we can't tell him
 
04:34:28.150 --> 04:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
what to do right you know we cannot hear
 
04:34:32.310 --> 04:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:33.830 --> 04:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
and i will not translate what i think
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
you just said
 
04:34:38.470 --> 04:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
he should probably phone in to speak
 
04:34:39.990 --> 04:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so what you do is stay where you
 
04:34:42.470 --> 04:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
are just get your cell phone and
 
04:34:45.990 --> 04:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
and phone in if you have the
 
04:34:48.070 --> 04:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
i'm writing him a note
 
04:34:50.629 --> 04:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
no he's he got it he can hear us he can
 
04:34:52.869 --> 04:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
hear us no he can't hear us if he's

turned off his mic no no i was uh our
 
04:34:57.429 --> 04:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
speakers are meaningless
 
04:34:57.439 --> 04:34:58.551 align:start position:0%
speakers are meaningless
speakers

04:34:58.551 --> 04:34:58.561 align:start position:0%

teddy's tragedy is one in a line of many

many tragedies across the country
 
04:39:58.868 --> 04:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
exactly like his teddy was entrusted
 
04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
with a local groomer teddy passed away
 
04:40:03.430 --> 04:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
while in the groomer's care teddy's
 
04:40:05.190 --> 04:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
owners and the groomer find themselves
 
04:40:07.030 --> 04:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
at odds over the health and well-being
 
04:40:09.670 --> 04:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
of the pet prior to grooming the groomer
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
and the client find themselves locked in
 
04:40:13.510 --> 04:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
a legal battle over the responsibility
 
04:40:14.948 --> 04:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
for the pet's death
 
04:40:17.670 --> 04:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately no one is held
 
04:40:19.830 --> 04:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
accountable result
 
04:40:21.510 --> 04:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
the loss of a beloved member of the
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
family loss of professional credibility
 
04:40:27.030 --> 04:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
and business and no resolution
 
04:40:29.510 --> 04:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
the study of the interconnection between
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
pet health
 
04:40:33.030 --> 04:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
client responsibility and professional
 
04:40:35.030 --> 04:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
accountability is a critical goal for
 
04:40:37.270 --> 04:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
the committee committee to study
 
04:40:39.190 --> 04:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
so again i respectfully ask the members
 
04:40:41.190 --> 04:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
of the commerce and consumer affairs
 
04:40:43.670 --> 04:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
committee vote off to pass on house bill
 
04:40:46.070 --> 04:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
92 i thank you for your time it would be
 
04:40:47.830 --> 04:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions and again
 
04:40:50.550 --> 04:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
apologize for the inconvenience
 
04:40:51.990 --> 04:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
that i caused the beginning of the
 
04:40:52.000 --> 04:40:54.788 align:start position:0%
that i caused the beginning of the
meeting

04:40:54.788 --> 04:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:56.230 --> 04:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
no problem at all
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh so we do have some questions uh first
 
04:41:02.230 --> 04:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
up is representative abramson
 
04:41:04.230 --> 04:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
04:41:07.430 --> 04:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um i did find a
 
04:41:09.430 --> 04:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
story cat mysteriously died at pet
 
04:41:11.910 --> 04:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
groomers got cremated without permission
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
from 2015 and i guess they're
 
04:41:17.350 --> 04:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
in the news one of these cases a year
 
04:41:19.510 --> 04:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
gets reported but uh
 
04:41:21.670 --> 04:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
my question or i guess my concern is why
 
04:41:24.390 --> 04:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
aren't there any pet groomers
 
04:41:25.910 --> 04:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
or would there be any pet groomers
 
04:41:29.910 --> 04:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:31.910 --> 04:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
um very good question thank you for the
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
question representative abramson um when
 
04:41:36.948 --> 04:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
the bill first came out i think the
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
intention was to have a larger
 
04:41:42.708 --> 04:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
commission and and pet groomers pet
 
04:41:44.230 --> 04:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
groomer association the various
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
associations that exist might have been
 
04:41:49.590 --> 04:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
included there however the amendment to
 
04:41:51.910 --> 04:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
this refine this down from the
 
04:41:54.230 --> 04:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
commission to a committee so that it
 
04:41:55.590 --> 04:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
would be members of the house
 
04:41:58.310 --> 04:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
investigating this i think that those
 
04:42:01.350 --> 04:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh professionals might be included in
 
04:42:02.948 --> 04:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
should this bill pass
 
04:42:05.350 --> 04:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
would be invited to participate in the
 
04:42:07.270 --> 04:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
hearings and discussions but they are
 
04:42:09.910 --> 04:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
not specifically assigned to the
 
04:42:09.920 --> 04:42:11.190 align:start position:0%
not specifically assigned to the
committee

04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:42:11.200 --> 04:42:12.470 align:start position:0%
committee
follow-up

04:42:12.470 --> 04:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:42:14.310 --> 04:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
for the question may inquire
 
04:42:14.320 --> 04:42:15.190 align:start position:0%
for the question may inquire
uh

04:42:15.190 --> 04:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:17.430 --> 04:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry this isn't quite related to my
 
04:42:19.430 --> 04:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
first question but uh
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
usually what we find is that the
 
04:42:21.120 --> 04:42:23.270 align:start position:0%
usually what we find is that the
licensing

04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
04:42:25.030 --> 04:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
and certification almost always starts
 
04:42:26.550 --> 04:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
out privately
 
04:42:28.230 --> 04:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
and then sometimes moves on to state
 
04:42:28.240 --> 04:42:29.350 align:start position:0%
and then sometimes moves on to state
licensing

04:42:29.350 --> 04:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
04:42:31.110 --> 04:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
with this commit sorry with this
 
04:42:31.120 --> 04:42:32.070 align:start position:0%
with this commit sorry with this
committee

04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:42:34.390 --> 04:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
be free to
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
consider promoting private licensing
 
04:42:41.110 --> 04:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
i i would hope that they would oh again
 
04:42:43.030 --> 04:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i i thank you for the the
 
04:42:45.270 --> 04:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
second question i i think that would be
 
04:42:46.628 --> 04:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
something that certainly would be in
 
04:42:47.910 --> 04:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
their purview
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:42:51.430 --> 04:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
i i think representative you and i might
 
04:42:53.270 --> 04:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
agree that smaller government is good
 
04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
government and so i would welcome
 
04:42:57.750 --> 04:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
something that
 
04:42:59.910 --> 04:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
creates that kind of accountability but
 
04:43:01.910 --> 04:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe we don't need another layer
 
04:43:03.430 --> 04:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
of government maybe we don't need
 
04:43:06.390 --> 04:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
another uh a board or a commission to
 
04:43:08.550 --> 04:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
look at this but but to but to look at
 
04:43:11.670 --> 04:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
the entire package in its entirety uh so
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
that everyone has some level of
 
04:43:15.990 --> 04:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
protection and confidence i would hope
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
that they would look at all
 
04:43:18.868 --> 04:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
possibilities all right thank you very
 
04:43:18.878 --> 04:43:19.830 align:start position:0%
possibilities all right thank you very
much

04:43:19.830 --> 04:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:43:21.510 --> 04:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
and it's good thank you
 
04:43:23.670 --> 04:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
okay good to see you
 
04:43:26.550 --> 04:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
next up is uh representative bartlett
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
04:43:30.788 --> 04:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
okay i've got two questions
 
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
um one is
 
04:43:34.628 --> 04:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
if there's already a private
 
04:43:34.638 --> 04:43:36.070 align:start position:0%
if there's already a private
certification

04:43:36.070 --> 04:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
certification
 
04:43:40.628 --> 04:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:43.350 --> 04:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
i can um i can i think there's one
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
speaker coming up after me who can get
 
04:43:48.230 --> 04:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
into more detail but the certifications
 
04:43:49.830 --> 04:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
would require
 
04:43:49.840 --> 04:43:50.708 align:start position:0%
would require
um

04:43:50.708 --> 04:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:53.670 --> 04:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
that you go to uh classroom training i i
 
04:43:55.510 --> 04:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
say classroom at you know it might be a
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
little bit different now that we're
 
04:43:58.230 --> 04:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
doing it on zoom but you need that
 
04:44:00.948 --> 04:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
specific training in the various types
 
04:44:02.788 --> 04:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
of conditions that you're looking for on
 
04:44:04.868 --> 04:44:04.878 align:start position:0%
dogs the various types of
 
04:44:07.750 --> 04:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
of of of hair and skin types on dogs
 
04:44:10.150 --> 04:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
some have fur some okay so you you go
 
04:44:12.310 --> 04:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
through understanding the differences in
 
04:44:13.990 --> 04:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
the breed you go through the different
 
04:44:14.000 --> 04:44:15.030 align:start position:0%
the breed you go through the different
cuts

04:44:15.030 --> 04:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
cuts
 
04:44:17.590 --> 04:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
that are available you and and you go
 
04:44:19.110 --> 04:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
through this process for this
 
04:44:19.120 --> 04:44:20.788 align:start position:0%
through this process for this
certification

04:44:20.788 --> 04:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
certification
 
04:44:22.470 --> 04:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
um once
 
04:44:24.868 --> 04:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
once you are certified i do understand
 
04:44:27.110 --> 04:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
that you can go to become a
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
a master groomer which is fairly fairly
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
expensive and very very rigorous
 
04:44:36.628 --> 04:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
but doesn't give you but doesn't give
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
you this type any type of addition
 
04:44:41.750 --> 04:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
additional licensure it would just be uh
 
04:44:43.670 --> 04:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
that extra level that you're going for
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
that extra expertise that you are
 
04:44:48.708 --> 04:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
getting and and i i apologize that i
 
04:44:50.708 --> 04:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
can't speak to it specifically it's not
 
04:44:53.190 --> 04:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
my area of expertise uh but i think we
 
04:44:55.270 --> 04:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
can ask one of the one of the next
 
04:44:57.830 --> 04:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
speakers to to expand upon that and i'm
 
04:44:59.910 --> 04:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
sorry that i'm kind of speaking uh on
 
04:45:01.830 --> 04:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
the surface for answering your question
 
04:45:01.840 --> 04:45:03.430 align:start position:0%
the surface for answering your question
superficially

04:45:03.430 --> 04:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
superficially
 
04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay could i ask a follow-up further
 
04:45:08.830 --> 04:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
question me inquire thanks very much um
 
04:45:12.150 --> 04:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
so as representative um abramson just
 
04:45:15.190 --> 04:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
said if private
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
certification if you will
 
04:45:19.110 --> 04:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
could take the place of
 
04:45:21.510 --> 04:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
state licensing
 
04:45:25.350 --> 04:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
would that be acceptable to you
 
04:45:27.590 --> 04:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you again for the question i'm
 
04:45:28.868 --> 04:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
not sure i said thank you the first time
 
04:45:32.788 --> 04:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:32.798 --> 04:45:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:45:33.590 --> 04:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
the certificate
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
i would like the committee to to look at
 
04:45:40.070 --> 04:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
that to to really understand that
 
04:45:41.990 --> 04:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
because one of the concerns that i would
 
04:45:45.910 --> 04:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
have is a consistency it for instance if
 
04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
if organization a offers a certificate
 
04:45:52.628 --> 04:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
but an organization b offers also a
 
04:45:54.150 --> 04:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
certificate in the state of new
 
04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire is that the same certificate
 
04:45:58.788 --> 04:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
are you getting the same training is
 
04:46:01.350 --> 04:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
there the same accountability uh
 
04:46:04.948 --> 04:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
available um and not i i shouldn't just
 
04:46:06.628 --> 04:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
leave this at the
 
04:46:09.510 --> 04:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
the pet the groomer and the client but
 
04:46:12.708 --> 04:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
is the facility that they're in also
 
04:46:14.948 --> 04:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
held to the same standard
 
04:46:17.190 --> 04:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
do they need to have msds forms
 
04:46:17.200 --> 04:46:18.550 align:start position:0%
do they need to have msds forms
available

04:46:18.550 --> 04:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:46:20.470 --> 04:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
does it pass all all
 
04:46:22.150 --> 04:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully it would pass all local and
 
04:46:23.830 --> 04:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
state inspections but i would want to
 
04:46:25.590 --> 04:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's a consistency i
 
04:46:26.788 --> 04:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
hope that they would look for a
 
04:46:30.390 --> 04:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
consistency so that um so so that so
 
04:46:32.788 --> 04:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
that again we create that accountability
 
04:46:35.190 --> 04:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
that's universal throughout the state
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
and i hope i've answered your question
 
04:46:38.310 --> 04:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
thanks very much
 
04:46:39.990 --> 04:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay you're welcome thank you
 
04:46:42.550 --> 04:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative has a question
 
04:46:44.070 --> 04:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:46:46.070 --> 04:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
a question um
 
04:46:49.750 --> 04:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
do the animal groomers want this
 
04:46:53.270 --> 04:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:54.868 --> 04:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
04:46:56.708 --> 04:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
question and i think that's an excellent
 
04:46:56.718 --> 04:46:57.750 align:start position:0%
question and i think that's an excellent
question

04:46:57.750 --> 04:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:46:59.510 --> 04:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
um and one of this
 
04:47:02.550 --> 04:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
there is i do have testimony from an
 
04:47:02.560 --> 04:47:03.830 align:start position:0%
there is i do have testimony from an
owner

04:47:03.830 --> 04:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
owner
 
04:47:05.990 --> 04:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
of a of a shop down here where actually
 
04:47:09.110 --> 04:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately teddy passed away her name
 
04:47:11.670 --> 04:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
is nancy massett and she owns in dog
 
04:47:11.680 --> 04:47:12.708 align:start position:0%
is nancy massett and she owns in dog
neato

04:47:12.708 --> 04:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
neato
 
04:47:16.470 --> 04:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
pet groomers uh she is one of i believe
 
04:47:18.788 --> 04:47:18.798 align:start position:0%
many groomers who would like to have
 
04:47:21.190 --> 04:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
this and and and here's the other point
 
04:47:24.390 --> 04:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
which i think is very very important and
 
04:47:27.030 --> 04:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
when when this animal when teddy passed
 
04:47:29.430 --> 04:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
away when teddy shroppy passed away
 
04:47:31.510 --> 04:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
we were fa the the the owner and the
 
04:47:33.670 --> 04:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
groomer were faced with the conundrum
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
who's responsible
 
04:47:39.190 --> 04:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
so the groomers want this also because
 
04:47:41.590 --> 04:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
what we have instead of it's a he said
 
04:47:44.230 --> 04:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
she said we have a standard did the dog
 
04:47:46.788 --> 04:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
come in exhausted and therefore was at
 
04:47:49.110 --> 04:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
risk and not the groomer's fault for
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
passing away so to create again i i
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
apologize for harping on the word but i
 
04:47:55.030 --> 04:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
think it's so important to create the
 
04:47:57.350 --> 04:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
accountability on both sides that it's
 
04:47:59.910 --> 04:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
mutual uh so i do believe that the
 
04:48:01.990 --> 04:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
groomers want this for their own
 
04:48:04.788 --> 04:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
protection even if it comes at the cost
 
04:48:08.230 --> 04:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
of of a license which may be um you know
 
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
i i ventured against maybe a couple
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and every every penny
 
04:48:14.470 --> 04:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
that we spend is important but i think
 
04:48:15.750 --> 04:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
that kind of
 
04:48:18.070 --> 04:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
guarantees or accountability would be
 
04:48:19.910 --> 04:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
valuable i hope i've answered your
 
04:48:19.920 --> 04:48:23.190 align:start position:0%
valuable i hope i've answered your
question

04:48:23.190 --> 04:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:28.788 --> 04:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you do we have uh or have you
 
04:48:33.830 --> 04:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
supplied us with uh documentation
 
04:48:36.310 --> 04:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
indication indicating the the range and
 
04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
magnitude and number of the problems
 
04:48:38.400 --> 04:48:39.510 align:start position:0%
magnitude and number of the problems
that

04:48:39.510 --> 04:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:42.150 --> 04:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
are prompting you to
 
04:48:45.110 --> 04:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:46.150 --> 04:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
04:48:47.430 --> 04:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
question and
 
04:48:51.030 --> 04:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
statistics are extremely important
 
04:48:53.350 --> 04:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
and i could not find
 
04:48:55.030 --> 04:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
i could not find and i and i would
 
04:48:57.190 --> 04:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
welcome this from anybody who can offer
 
04:48:58.628 --> 04:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
it including some of the other folks who
 
04:49:02.070 --> 04:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
might testify after me those statistics
 
04:49:04.550 --> 04:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
which say x number of pets
 
04:49:08.310 --> 04:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
die annually for these reasons now i i
 
04:49:10.230 --> 04:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
can say having spoken with this owner
 
04:49:12.628 --> 04:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
who i named nancy manson she said that
 
04:49:16.230 --> 04:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
in the state um seven to eight dogs uh
 
04:49:17.750 --> 04:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
have passed away i think i have that
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
number right seven to eight dogs do pass
 
04:49:19.680 --> 04:49:20.550 align:start position:0%
number right seven to eight dogs do pass
away

04:49:20.550 --> 04:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
away
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
uh annually for any number of reasons
 
04:49:24.310 --> 04:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
why they're in a pet
 
04:49:26.390 --> 04:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
while they're in a groomer's care
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
now i i would venture to say is that and
 
04:49:31.110 --> 04:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to all of us who
 
04:49:33.430 --> 04:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
have pets is that statistically
 
04:49:34.948 --> 04:49:34.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know is that within a
 
04:49:37.670 --> 04:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
statistically acceptable range is that
 
04:49:39.510 --> 04:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
just what happens sometimes is that
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
abnormal or or normal
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
so i apologize that i can't i can't give
 
04:49:46.230 --> 04:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
you the statistics that we would both
 
04:49:47.990 --> 04:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
want but i would hope that the committee
 
04:49:50.310 --> 04:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
then would also be able to get those
 
04:49:52.708 --> 04:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
statistics or at least be able to answer
 
04:49:54.150 --> 04:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
the question
 
04:49:56.310 --> 04:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your response
 
04:49:57.750 --> 04:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:49:57.760 --> 04:49:58.708 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

okay
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
um have any no more questions we thank
 
04:50:04.230 --> 04:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony
 
04:50:05.750 --> 04:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone and i i will try to
 
04:50:07.670 --> 04:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
mute myself
 
04:50:10.230 --> 04:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
i think you've already done that yes
 
04:50:12.310 --> 04:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
i've done that
 
04:50:14.868 --> 04:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
okay so the chair will call on joanne
 
04:50:14.878 --> 04:50:17.350 align:start position:0%
okay so the chair will call on joanne
schwab

04:50:17.350 --> 04:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
and all you have to do is unmute

groomer
 
04:51:26.230 --> 04:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
she left him in an unsafe situation
 
04:51:28.550 --> 04:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
inside a drying cage with a noose around
 
04:51:30.788 --> 04:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
his neck he most likely died of heat

stroke based on the necropsy findings
 
04:51:34.948 --> 04:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
and according to the groomer's statement
 
04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
to the vet she made a gesture indicating
 
04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
he may have hung himself
 
04:51:40.550 --> 04:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
my thought has been that he might have
 
04:51:42.150 --> 04:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
been struggling to get out of an awful
 
04:51:42.160 --> 04:51:43.430 align:start position:0%
been struggling to get out of an awful

04:51:43.430 --> 04:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:51:45.030 --> 04:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
and the thought of teddy suffering is
 
04:51:47.510 --> 04:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking and has haunted me the
 
04:51:49.270 --> 04:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
groomer said she left the building for a
 
04:51:51.030 --> 04:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
period of 12 or so minutes to pick up
 
04:51:52.868 --> 04:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
her lunch
 
04:51:54.550 --> 04:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
there were other dogs in her care when i
 
04:51:56.470 --> 04:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
dropped teddy off in the morning
 
04:51:58.070 --> 04:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
she worked alone meaning that she left
 
04:52:00.550 --> 04:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
all of them unattended as well when she
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
returned teddy was dead
 
04:52:05.190 --> 04:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
she enlisted the help of her landlord to
 
04:52:07.510 --> 04:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
take teddy's body to a nearby vet asking
 
04:52:09.670 --> 04:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
them to keep him in a refrigerator until
 
04:52:11.670 --> 04:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
the owner could be notified
 
04:52:13.510 --> 04:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
she could not tell them how old he was
 
04:52:15.510 --> 04:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
who his owner was or give them a phone
 
04:52:17.190 --> 04:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
number because she said she did not have
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
the information
 
04:52:20.230 --> 04:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
i had been to this groomer one other
 
04:52:22.830 --> 04:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
time just a few months prior in april of
 
04:52:25.590 --> 04:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
2018 so i had no reason to believe that
 
04:52:27.510 --> 04:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
she would not have my emergency contact
 
04:52:27.520 --> 04:52:28.868 align:start position:0%
she would not have my emergency contact
information

04:52:28.868 --> 04:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:52:30.550 --> 04:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
i went to pick teddy up at the agreed
 
04:52:31.830 --> 04:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
upon time
 
04:52:33.350 --> 04:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
only to meet her in the parking lot as
 
04:52:35.430 --> 04:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
she was returning from the vet
 
04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
she told me teddy had died he had
 
04:52:39.510 --> 04:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
arrived there a healthy vibrant dog that
 
04:52:39.520 --> 04:52:40.628 align:start position:0%
arrived there a healthy vibrant dog that
morning

04:52:40.628 --> 04:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
morning
 
04:52:42.470 --> 04:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
my own vet was horrified by teddy's
 
04:52:44.310 --> 04:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
death and took it upon herself to visit
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
the groomer's site with her manager the
 
04:52:47.430 --> 04:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
next day
 
04:52:49.350 --> 04:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
the groomer was on her computer at her
 
04:52:50.948 --> 04:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
front desk when they walked in with a
 
04:52:53.430 --> 04:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
dog on a table behind her unsupervised
 
04:52:55.350 --> 04:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
it had a noose around its neck
 
04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
she would not let my vet see where teddy
 
04:52:59.510 --> 04:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
was kept when he died my vet also said
 
04:53:00.868 --> 04:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
the groomer seemed indifferent and
 
04:53:00.878 --> 04:53:02.390 align:start position:0%
the groomer seemed indifferent and
unapologetic

04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
unapologetic
 
04:53:03.990 --> 04:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
because the police eventually became
 
04:53:06.628 --> 04:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
involved the media was notified and took
 
04:53:09.190 --> 04:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
a special interest in teddy's story
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
the police and i received numerous calls
 
04:53:12.550 --> 04:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
from individuals with their own stories
 
04:53:14.868 --> 04:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
of neglect by this groomer
 
04:53:16.470 --> 04:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
it was the media interest which was a
 
04:53:18.310 --> 04:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
blessing and it created a tremendous
 
04:53:20.868 --> 04:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
amount of awareness in the community
 
04:53:22.948 --> 04:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
within days of teddy's death i had done
 
04:53:24.230 --> 04:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
some research and found out that
 
04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
groomers do not need to be licensed in
 
04:53:27.670 --> 04:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:53:29.910 --> 04:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
i was shocked and in disbelief i also
 
04:53:32.628 --> 04:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
was unaware that drying cages existed my
 
04:53:34.070 --> 04:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
impression had always been one from
 
04:53:36.150 --> 04:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
watching dog shows on tv where groomers
 
04:53:38.708 --> 04:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
use hair dryers to dry their dogs as
 
04:53:41.350 --> 04:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
teddy's mom i became extremely regretful
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
i did not know any of this
 
04:53:45.190 --> 04:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
as i began talking about this with
 
04:53:47.510 --> 04:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
friends neighbors and complete strangers
 
04:53:49.990 --> 04:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
that called me to express their sympathy
 
04:53:51.670 --> 04:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
i learned that most people were dumb as
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
dumbfounded as i was
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
after being contacted by several
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
sympathetic strangers and groomers i
 
04:54:00.310 --> 04:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
began my research to get answers and to
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
see if there could be a path towards
 
04:54:03.670 --> 04:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
creating some sort of industry standards
 
04:54:05.190 --> 04:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
and accountability
 
04:54:07.110 --> 04:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
my reasons for supporting this bill run
 
04:54:09.510 --> 04:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
deep my family's hearts were broken from
 
04:54:11.510 --> 04:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
our loss i would not wish that kind of
 
04:54:13.350 --> 04:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
suffering upon anyone
 
04:54:15.430 --> 04:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
i have learned about numerous pet deaths
 
04:54:17.590 --> 04:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the country sorry
 
04:54:19.030 --> 04:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
caused by unsafe or neglectful
 
04:54:21.270 --> 04:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances while in a groomer's care
 
04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
i do believe there are many responsible
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
groomers out there but one unnecessary
 
04:54:27.590 --> 04:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
death is too many and seven to eight is
 
04:54:29.990 --> 04:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
worse not to mention countless injuries
 
04:54:31.750 --> 04:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
sustained by pets during the grooming
 
04:54:33.270 --> 04:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
process when proper care is not
 
04:54:33.280 --> 04:54:34.708 align:start position:0%
process when proper care is not
administered

04:54:34.708 --> 04:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
administered
 
04:54:37.190 --> 04:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
also of importance is proper sanitation
 
04:54:39.030 --> 04:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
without which various parasitic
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
infections and diseases may spread
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
if there had been some sort of registry
 
04:54:45.190 --> 04:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
where the many complaints against this
 
04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
groomer could have been documented teddy
 
04:54:48.868 --> 04:54:48.878 align:start position:0%
might still be with us
 
04:54:50.868 --> 04:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
we need to find a way to establish what
 
04:54:53.030 --> 04:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
should be considered best practices for
 
04:54:55.350 --> 04:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
companion animal groomers
 
04:54:57.350 --> 04:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
to try and prevent any future accidents
 
04:54:59.990 --> 04:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
or deaths with a lack of regulation
 
04:55:01.830 --> 04:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
there are no training standards to keep
 
04:55:03.670 --> 04:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
pet groomers accountable
 
04:55:05.430 --> 04:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
as a native of new hampshire i fully
 
04:55:07.670 --> 04:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
support our live free or die ideology
 
04:55:09.270 --> 04:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
and understand that sometimes things can
 
04:55:11.670 --> 04:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
be overregulated that is not our way but
 
04:55:14.470 --> 04:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
we do need to protect animals rights
 
04:55:15.910 --> 04:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
i believe the study would be very
 
04:55:17.430 --> 04:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
thoughtful way to gain clarity and
 
04:55:19.270 --> 04:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
establish practices and protocol that
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
will help ensure the safety of our pets
 
04:55:23.510 --> 04:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
they have no say in what happens to them
 
04:55:25.510 --> 04:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
or where they are brought for care
 
04:55:27.270 --> 04:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
our laws protecting our pets have not
 
04:55:29.350 --> 04:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
evolved with society and i believe most
 
04:55:31.510 --> 04:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
people that have pets would qualify them
 
04:55:33.910 --> 04:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
as family members not personal property
 
04:55:35.910 --> 04:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
as the law currently states
 
04:55:37.350 --> 04:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
this will also help rumors and
 
04:55:39.430 --> 04:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately protect them as well
 
04:55:40.708 --> 04:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
we should have a minimum set of
 
04:55:42.470 --> 04:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
standards much the same as hairdressers
 
04:55:44.550 --> 04:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
do as one of our new hampshire chiefs of
 
04:55:46.310 --> 04:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
police said at a meeting that i attended
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
that same year which was the governor's
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
commission on the humane treatment of
 
04:55:52.310 --> 04:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
animals he said rules and regulations
 
04:55:54.310 --> 04:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
help the industry by making it more
 
04:55:56.628 --> 04:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
professional while also protecting the
 
04:55:58.948 --> 04:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
business when something bad happens i
 
04:56:00.550 --> 04:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
could not agree more
 
04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
safety standards and methods can prevent
 
04:56:03.990 --> 04:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
accidents and deaths
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%

well i didn't know what it was either so
 
04:57:10.470 --> 04:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
i had to uh google it and um i did get
 
04:57:13.110 --> 04:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
some pictures from um the groomer that
 
04:57:15.350 --> 04:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
um jim referenced representative
 
04:57:17.990 --> 04:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
majority sorry reference nancy massett
 
04:57:18.000 --> 04:57:18.948 align:start position:0%
majority sorry reference nancy massett
from

04:57:18.948 --> 04:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
what actually the actual
 
04:57:23.590 --> 04:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
equipment that was used on teddy because
 
04:57:25.750 --> 04:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
we were not allowed to see it
 
04:57:29.190 --> 04:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
um and they come in various um
 
04:57:32.070 --> 04:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
forms you can have a it's basically like
 
04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
a dog crate
 
04:57:37.110 --> 04:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
with um and they put a dryer outside and
 
04:57:39.430 --> 04:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
point it at the dog to you know just to
 
04:57:41.510 --> 04:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
speed up the drying process
 
04:57:44.150 --> 04:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
um in teddy's case he was in
 
04:57:46.310 --> 04:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
what looked more like an airline crate
 
04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
which is you know it's got more of the
 
04:57:49.510 --> 04:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
hard plastic
 
04:57:51.910 --> 04:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
which to me looked like an oven honestly
 
04:57:53.670 --> 04:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
i i feel like he was in it he was cooked
 
04:57:56.310 --> 04:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
in an oven and that's horrifying to me
 
04:57:59.270 --> 04:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
but um if it's i don't know all of the
 
04:58:01.190 --> 04:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
the you know different models that are
 
04:58:02.948 --> 04:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
out there but it is something that i
 
04:58:05.350 --> 04:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
feel should be banned i just after that
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know after seeing all these stories
 
04:58:09.750 --> 04:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
that i you know unfortunately i googled
 
04:58:11.350 --> 04:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of this after his death to find
 
04:58:11.360 --> 04:58:12.150 align:start position:0%
a lot of this after his death to find
out

04:58:12.150 --> 04:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:58:14.150 --> 04:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
um you know just different things that
 
04:58:15.670 --> 04:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
have have happened and that's a very
 
04:58:17.910 --> 04:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
common occurrence unfortunately
 
04:58:20.628 --> 04:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
um so as far as you know as how many
 
04:58:22.230 --> 04:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
different types and styles i can't
 
04:58:24.150 --> 04:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
answer that um nancy might have a better
 
04:58:25.830 --> 04:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
feel for that but i don't know i don't
 
04:58:28.868 --> 04:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
think she's able to speak with us today
 
04:58:30.788 --> 04:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:58:32.788 --> 04:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
uh now representative bartlett
 
04:58:35.910 --> 04:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i apologize my husband's a
 
04:58:37.830 --> 04:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
aarp tax aide
 
04:58:39.670 --> 04:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
volunteer and he's downstairs on one
 
04:58:45.990 --> 04:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:48.230 --> 04:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
have you have you been able to talk to
 
04:58:50.070 --> 04:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
the department of ag
 
04:58:52.788 --> 04:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
um and ask what their position might be
 
04:58:52.798 --> 04:58:53.670 align:start position:0%
um and ask what their position might be
um

04:58:53.670 --> 04:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's not really just on the study
 
04:58:57.430 --> 04:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
committee but you know what what they
 
04:58:58.948 --> 04:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
might have to say
 
04:59:01.190 --> 04:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh regarding pet grooming because they
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
do care about um
 
04:59:03.200 --> 04:59:05.590 align:start position:0%
do care about um
pets

04:59:05.590 --> 04:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:08.470 --> 04:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
um you're asking me correct i am thank
 
04:59:11.110 --> 04:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
you yes i i haven't spoken again to the
 
04:59:12.628 --> 04:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
committee but when we did speak with the
 
04:59:14.948 --> 04:59:14.958 align:start position:0%
committee they became quite concerned
 
04:59:18.070 --> 04:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
when the idea of these zoonotic diseases
 
04:59:20.390 --> 04:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
being spread um came up that seemed to
 
04:59:22.230 --> 04:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
really pique their interest
 
04:59:24.150 --> 04:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
um and you know and feel that there was
 
04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
a need to really look into this for that
 
04:59:28.868 --> 04:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
reason um if these groomers don't have
 
04:59:30.948 --> 04:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
any kind of sanitary guide sanitation
 
04:59:30.958 --> 04:59:32.150 align:start position:0%
any kind of sanitary guide sanitation
guidelines

04:59:32.150 --> 04:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
04:59:34.948 --> 04:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
my understanding um is you know
 
04:59:37.110 --> 04:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
and there's nancy's testimony which i
 
04:59:38.788 --> 04:59:38.798 align:start position:0%
think jim is going to read there's a lot
 
04:59:40.470 --> 04:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
of references to all the different
 
04:59:42.390 --> 04:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
things that can happen so from that
 
04:59:44.550 --> 04:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
standpoint i think they were quite
 
04:59:46.788 --> 04:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
interested in in you know looking into
 
04:59:48.390 --> 04:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
this further
 
04:59:50.150 --> 04:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
ask a follow-up for the question be
 
04:59:52.070 --> 04:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
inquired thank you um i'm sorry i'm a
 
04:59:53.990 --> 04:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
little confused um
 
04:59:56.708 --> 04:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
i was specifically thinking about the
 
04:59:58.230 --> 04:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
state vet
 
04:59:58.240 --> 04:59:59.910 align:start position:0%
state vet
um

04:59:59.910 --> 04:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:01.430 --> 05:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
and you're talking about a committee is
 
05:00:03.350 --> 05:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
there a different committee that we're
 
05:00:05.430 --> 05:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
referring to here i was talking about
 
05:00:07.270 --> 05:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
the original committee that heard this
 
05:00:09.910 --> 05:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh oh i'm sorry okay no that's okay but
 
05:00:11.430 --> 05:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
the state vet did come up in that
 
05:00:13.990 --> 05:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
conversation as being a
 
05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
probably a key player for in any type of
 
05:00:20.628 --> 05:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
um setting up any type of standards for
 
05:00:25.430 --> 05:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:33.110 --> 05:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:35.510 --> 05:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh i'm sorry for
 
05:00:37.750 --> 05:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
your loss thank you um
 
05:00:40.150 --> 05:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable to an amendment
 
05:00:41.510 --> 05:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
to this where we
 
05:00:43.510 --> 05:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
add consideration of groups like uh i
 
05:00:43.520 --> 05:00:44.390 align:start position:0%
add consideration of groups like uh i
guess

05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
guess
 
05:00:46.390 --> 05:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
the national dog rumors association of
 
05:00:49.030 --> 05:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
america has uh its own certification
 
05:00:49.040 --> 05:00:50.948 align:start position:0%
america has uh its own certification
process

05:00:50.948 --> 05:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:00:53.030 --> 05:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
maybe even considering that uh pet
 
05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
groomers have to join some type of
 
05:00:57.750 --> 05:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh regional or national association of
 
05:01:00.150 --> 05:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
some type that has certification
 
05:01:02.310 --> 05:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
has its own certification process rather
 
05:01:05.430 --> 05:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:08.070 --> 05:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
um i i jim might be able to speak to
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
this as well i mean my
 
05:01:11.670 --> 05:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
feeling is that there are a bunch of
 
05:01:13.430 --> 05:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
different groups out there
 
05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
05:01:16.550 --> 05:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
getting back to jim's point about
 
05:01:18.070 --> 05:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
consistency that's the only thing i
 
05:01:19.990 --> 05:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
would be concerned with is
 
05:01:21.270 --> 05:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
05:01:23.670 --> 05:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
nancy's very very in tune with what's
 
05:01:26.310 --> 05:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
out there um she she presented
 
05:01:28.470 --> 05:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if we submitted it or
 
05:01:31.110 --> 05:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
not but she presented um
 
05:01:32.150 --> 05:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
i thought if it was the state of
 
05:01:34.550 --> 05:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
illinois maybe they they actually have
 
05:01:36.708 --> 05:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
a wonderful set of standards that they
 
05:01:39.590 --> 05:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
published which we could provide um just
 
05:01:41.430 --> 05:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
as a sort of like as a frame of
 
05:01:41.440 --> 05:01:42.628 align:start position:0%
as a sort of like as a frame of
reference

05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
reference
 
05:01:45.990 --> 05:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
um but i i think that that would be a
 
05:01:48.390 --> 05:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
start i think my main concern is just
 
05:01:48.400 --> 05:01:49.670 align:start position:0%
start i think my main concern is just
that

05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:01:51.350 --> 05:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
um some of them are out there to make
 
05:01:53.110 --> 05:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
money and others are really out there
 
05:01:55.270 --> 05:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
because they care about the animals
 
05:01:56.708 --> 05:01:56.718 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm not saying that they don't
 
05:01:58.390 --> 05:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
care about animals but a lot of it is
 
05:01:59.750 --> 05:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know some people are in business to
 
05:02:01.190 --> 05:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
make money and that's what business is
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
about but
 
05:02:04.310 --> 05:02:04.320 align:start position:0%

on this i i am
 
05:03:43.990 --> 05:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
not i am neutral against it for um just
 
05:03:46.470 --> 05:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that groomers
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
need to have their say in this and that
 
05:03:51.190 --> 05:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
we're a big part of the process and
 
05:03:54.708 --> 05:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of us who are for this
 
05:03:58.230 --> 05:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
um with the right steps being put into
 
05:03:59.910 --> 05:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
action for it
 
05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
um i i own a grooming academy in
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
portsmouth and um we are
 
05:04:06.958 --> 05:04:08.470 align:start position:0%
portsmouth and um we are
are

05:04:08.470 --> 05:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:04:12.788 --> 05:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
working with the commit the um
 
05:04:15.190 --> 05:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
organizations that are all that you're
 
05:04:18.470 --> 05:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
talking about the national dog groomers

cosmetologists
 
05:04:26.868 --> 05:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
we're members of and active in the
 
05:04:28.948 --> 05:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
an organization the international
 
05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
professional groomers
 
05:04:34.788 --> 05:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
most of our groomers here are certified
 
05:04:37.030 --> 05:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
through them as
 
05:04:39.350 --> 05:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
groomers stylists
 
05:04:42.470 --> 05:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of national training and
 
05:04:44.948 --> 05:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
have groomers from all over the world
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
and country coming in for us for
 
05:04:49.830 --> 05:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
training um
 
05:04:53.430 --> 05:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
we take there is and i'm gonna correct
 
05:04:55.190 --> 05:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
in some of that
 
05:04:58.788 --> 05:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
there is licensing in el paso texas
 
05:05:02.070 --> 05:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
that was just passed uh not too long ago
 
05:05:05.590 --> 05:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
i was actually there in december
 
05:05:08.550 --> 05:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
for that and part of that process
 
05:05:12.230 --> 05:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
um those groomers they do have rules and
 
05:05:14.868 --> 05:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
regulations and they are being looked at
 
05:05:17.350 --> 05:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
so that might be something to consider
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
looking into is the el paso
 
05:05:19.920 --> 05:05:21.110 align:start position:0%
looking into is the el paso
licensure

05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
05:05:23.910 --> 05:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
and they are working with the texas
 
05:05:26.230 --> 05:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
association that has just started for
 
05:05:29.350 --> 05:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
groomers there the woman who is running
 
05:05:32.868 --> 05:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
that is an academy owner as well so her
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
and i um work together and and have been
 
05:05:39.510 --> 05:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
i've been talking a lot about that
 
05:05:41.910 --> 05:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
we're also members and i'm on the
 
05:05:45.030 --> 05:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
leadership council for an organization
 
05:05:47.590 --> 05:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's called naga which is the national
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
alliance of grooming associations
 
05:05:53.510 --> 05:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
um i presented a lot of this information
 
05:05:55.750 --> 05:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
when we were in this in
 
05:05:55.760 --> 05:05:57.750 align:start position:0%
when we were in this in
2019

05:05:57.750 --> 05:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
2019
 
05:06:00.628 --> 05:06:00.638 align:start position:0%
so i think a lot of the information has
 
05:06:02.948 --> 05:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
gotten around there are people that have
 
05:06:05.270 --> 05:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
tried in new hampshire to start an
 
05:06:05.280 --> 05:06:06.628 align:start position:0%
tried in new hampshire to start an
organization

05:06:06.628 --> 05:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
organization
 
05:06:08.708 --> 05:06:08.718 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it doesn't seem that
 
05:06:12.868 --> 05:06:12.878 align:start position:0%
there's commodity that that is
 
05:06:15.750 --> 05:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
amongst the industry and the groomers
 
05:06:17.430 --> 05:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
working together
 
05:06:20.230 --> 05:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
so that's been a big challenge pulling
 
05:06:22.150 --> 05:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
them together and again you kind of
 
05:06:24.470 --> 05:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
nailed it there's a lot of
 
05:06:27.190 --> 05:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
diversity in all of the organizations
 
05:06:29.430 --> 05:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
like joanne was talking about
 
05:06:29.440 --> 05:06:30.390 align:start position:0%
like joanne was talking about
um

05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:35.350 --> 05:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:37.350 --> 05:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
understanding each one and taking it
 
05:06:40.948 --> 05:06:40.958 align:start position:0%
into consideration now a new council has
 
05:06:44.470 --> 05:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
been formed and that is called for your
 
05:06:47.190 --> 05:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
reference the master groomer council and
 
05:06:50.230 --> 05:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
that is setting the best practices and
 
05:06:53.110 --> 05:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
procedures for groomers
 
05:06:56.868 --> 05:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
and that council meets every three weeks
 
05:06:59.190 --> 05:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
they are working on terminology they're
 
05:07:02.230 --> 05:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
working on setting guidelines um on a
 
05:07:04.470 --> 05:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
national level for groomers to be able
 
05:07:07.110 --> 05:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
to follow and
 
05:07:09.350 --> 05:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
for that council
 
05:07:11.990 --> 05:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
your voting rights come as a master
 
05:07:12.000 --> 05:07:13.190 align:start position:0%
your voting rights come as a master
groomer

05:07:13.190 --> 05:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
groomer
 
05:07:16.150 --> 05:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
so any master groomer is able to vote on
 
05:07:18.310 --> 05:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
that committee so those are the ones
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
that are are have gone through all the
 
05:07:22.000 --> 05:07:22.990 align:start position:0%
that are are have gone through all the
um

05:07:22.990 --> 05:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:26.470 --> 05:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
certifications in each organization
 
05:07:28.230 --> 05:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot to
 
05:07:29.590 --> 05:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
05:07:33.030 --> 05:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
details in our industry certifications
 
05:07:36.070 --> 05:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
the terms are thrown out there um the
 
05:07:39.270 --> 05:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
use of certificates and
 
05:07:39.280 --> 05:07:40.070 align:start position:0%
use of certificates and
the

05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:07:42.788 --> 05:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
we're trying to grasp the terminology to
 
05:07:44.628 --> 05:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
get it all together to be able to
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:49.680 --> 05:07:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:07:51.590 --> 05:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:07:55.590 --> 05:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh any questions from the committee
 
05:07:59.590 --> 05:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
so how uh do you uh as your so you this
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
whole pet nh that's your your training
 
05:08:04.948 --> 05:08:04.958 align:start position:0%
academy whole pet age the whole pet
 
05:08:07.590 --> 05:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
grooming academy yes i i just see that
 
05:08:09.910 --> 05:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
with your you're like so uh do you guys
 
05:08:11.990 --> 05:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
recommend this uh
 
05:08:15.430 --> 05:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
dryer this this try this crate dryer
 
05:08:18.628 --> 05:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
no we don't train with them we we are
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
not for um any type of cage drying so
 
05:08:24.550 --> 05:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
how how prevalent do you think cage
 
05:08:26.628 --> 05:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
drying is in new hampshire
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
um i think it depends on
 
05:08:30.718 --> 05:08:33.110 align:start position:0%
um i think it depends on
the

05:08:33.110 --> 05:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:33.120 --> 05:08:34.150 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:08:34.150 --> 05:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:08:36.628 --> 05:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
every grooming shop does their own thing
 
05:08:39.110 --> 05:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
so i would say probably here in new
 
05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire there's not as many using them
 
05:08:42.480 --> 05:08:43.990 align:start position:0%
hampshire there's not as many using them
anymore

05:08:43.990 --> 05:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
05:08:47.830 --> 05:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
a true cage dryer is very expensive
 
05:08:50.230 --> 05:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh they cost two to three thousand
 
05:08:50.240 --> 05:08:51.830 align:start position:0%
uh they cost two to three thousand
dollars

05:08:51.830 --> 05:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:08:54.868 --> 05:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
so it's not a a common piece of
 
05:08:57.670 --> 05:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
equipment what a lot of groomers will do
 
05:08:59.750 --> 05:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
is use a
 
05:09:01.270 --> 05:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
fan or
 
05:09:04.550 --> 05:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
hook up the blow dryers to the crates
 
05:09:07.670 --> 05:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
or the kennels and let them dry that way
 
05:09:10.470 --> 05:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
it is very hard to monitor the dog when
 
05:09:13.510 --> 05:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
they're in those situations
 
05:09:15.990 --> 05:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
and if you have a dog on the table you
 
05:09:19.190 --> 05:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
can't monitor the dogs that are there
 
05:09:22.390 --> 05:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of drying rooms are separate from
 
05:09:27.110 --> 05:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
finishing rooms so you have to the a
 
05:09:29.670 --> 05:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
small shop is going to have a high high
 
05:09:31.990 --> 05:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
heat humidity in their space with the
 
05:09:34.150 --> 05:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
water in the dryers
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's hard to regulate the dog's
 
05:09:38.948 --> 05:09:38.958 align:start position:0%
temperatures so larger spaces cooler
 
05:09:43.270 --> 05:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
spaces um well ventilated areas
 
05:09:45.750 --> 05:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
all of that needs to to be looked at
 
05:09:47.990 --> 05:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
when when purchasing or getting into
 
05:09:50.628 --> 05:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
shops and and business ownership
 
05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
right let alone for the consumer to
 
05:09:55.110 --> 05:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
decide which is safe place to take your
 
05:09:58.230 --> 05:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and open concept shops are are
 
05:10:02.310 --> 05:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
a lot more um looks and and and people
 
05:10:06.310 --> 05:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
are looking for shops that are more open
 
05:10:09.030 --> 05:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
and want that open concept grooming
 
05:10:10.628 --> 05:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson has a
 
05:10:10.638 --> 05:10:12.470 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson has a
question

05:10:12.470 --> 05:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:10:15.670 --> 05:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you is uh i've we've gotten a
 
05:10:16.948 --> 05:10:16.958 align:start position:0%
couple of emails saying that there are
 
05:10:19.590 --> 05:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
no groomers included on this committee
 
05:10:19.600 --> 05:10:20.390 align:start position:0%
no groomers included on this committee
um

05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:21.590 --> 05:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
are you saying that there should be
 
05:10:23.190 --> 05:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
groomers on this committee if it's going
 
05:10:25.750 --> 05:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
to operate
 
05:10:27.750 --> 05:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
i definitely would think that you would
 
05:10:31.350 --> 05:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
want some groomers on there um at least
 
05:10:33.350 --> 05:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
to have
 
05:10:38.310 --> 05:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
their input or their guidance um
 
05:10:40.470 --> 05:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily because when we did go
 
05:10:42.150 --> 05:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
through this process they were saying
 
05:10:44.948 --> 05:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
that this is going to be a full-time job
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
i would imagine you have a very brief
 
05:10:49.670 --> 05:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
time to turn this around and to do this
 
05:10:49.680 --> 05:10:51.190 align:start position:0%
time to turn this around and to do this
investigation

05:10:51.190 --> 05:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
05:10:51.200 --> 05:10:52.150 align:start position:0%
investigation
so

05:10:52.150 --> 05:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:10:52.160 --> 05:10:53.030 align:start position:0%
so
if

05:10:53.030 --> 05:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:10:58.628 --> 05:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
it's a a month period or an and the time
 
05:11:00.390 --> 05:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
time allowance for a groomer to walk
 
05:11:02.550 --> 05:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
away from their shop and and give the
 
05:11:05.190 --> 05:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
time is it's going to have to be a
 
05:11:07.670 --> 05:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
voluntary position i would imagine
 
05:11:07.680 --> 05:11:09.030 align:start position:0%
voluntary position i would imagine
um

05:11:09.030 --> 05:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:10.550 --> 05:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
to have a
 
05:11:10.560 --> 05:11:11.990 align:start position:0%
to have a
open

05:11:11.990 --> 05:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
open
 
05:11:14.310 --> 05:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
conversation with groomers i believe
 
05:11:16.550 --> 05:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
they did speak on that and saying we
 
05:11:18.628 --> 05:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
want to talk to corporates we want to
 
05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
talk to
 
05:11:22.628 --> 05:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
kennel owners we want to talk to vet
 
05:11:25.350 --> 05:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
clinics that have grooming shops
 
05:11:28.868 --> 05:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
in-home groomers mobile groomers
 
05:11:30.628 --> 05:11:30.638 align:start position:0%
groomers that do
 
05:11:33.430 --> 05:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
in-home grooming and travel
 
05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
so you've got a lot of different
 
05:11:41.110 --> 05:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
types of grooming going on
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's not just a shop environment
 
05:11:46.550 --> 05:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
all right thank you just uh for the
 
05:11:48.310 --> 05:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
education of our new members and there's
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
a there there are two kinds of uh study
 
05:11:52.150 --> 05:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
committees here in the legislative new
 
05:11:53.750 --> 05:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire legislature
 
05:11:56.230 --> 05:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
um we have what we would call a chapter
 
05:11:59.270 --> 05:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
study um which would uh would be really
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
a commission
 
05:12:02.230 --> 05:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
and in that commission you would bring
 
05:12:02.240 --> 05:12:02.948 align:start position:0%
and in that commission you would bring
in

05:12:02.948 --> 05:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:12:05.670 --> 05:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
all the different uh uh people who have
 
05:12:05.680 --> 05:12:06.628 align:start position:0%
all the different uh uh people who have
a

05:12:06.628 --> 05:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:12:08.390 --> 05:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
players and all the different types of
 
05:12:10.470 --> 05:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
industry and all the people
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
on an issue
 
05:12:11.760 --> 05:12:12.708 align:start position:0%
on an issue
um

05:12:12.708 --> 05:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:15.030 --> 05:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
and then you have a legislative study
 
05:12:16.708 --> 05:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
committee and that's what this is in the
 
05:12:19.350 --> 05:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee um and this
 
05:12:20.788 --> 05:12:20.798 align:start position:0%
is classic it has three members of the
 
05:12:23.430 --> 05:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
house and one senator uh usually the
 
05:12:25.030 --> 05:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
they we limit to one center because we
 
05:12:26.788 --> 05:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
want we hope we get at least one to show
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
up uh because often senators don't
 
05:12:31.590 --> 05:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
aren't his invested interest in in the
 
05:12:34.230 --> 05:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
study committees um and these study
 
05:12:35.910 --> 05:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
committees are are
 
05:12:39.590 --> 05:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
they're ta the idea is that um all the
 
05:12:41.990 --> 05:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
players all the people who have some
 
05:12:44.550 --> 05:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
some interest in in the issue would
 
05:12:46.948 --> 05:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
normally show up anyways to the study
 
05:12:49.350 --> 05:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
committees but they don't need to be the
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
voting members that the legislators are
 
05:12:53.750 --> 05:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
there um because then you're you're
 
05:12:56.150 --> 05:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
getting them to buy into the concept of
 
05:12:59.030 --> 05:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
whatever comes out of that committee
 
05:13:01.830 --> 05:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
okay having said that uh representative
 
05:13:06.390 --> 05:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:08.628 --> 05:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i think this a
 
05:13:11.910 --> 05:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
question may be for um the sponsor it's
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
in regards to the um
 
05:13:17.990 --> 05:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
membership of the committee we got some
 
05:13:20.310 --> 05:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
strange noises so dara you might you
 
05:13:22.150 --> 05:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
might want to mute
 
05:13:22.160 --> 05:13:23.670 align:start position:0%
might want to mute
um

05:13:23.670 --> 05:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:25.750 --> 05:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry say you're you're
 
05:13:28.470 --> 05:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
was yeah no i was i was looking i mean
 
05:13:30.150 --> 05:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
it just says three members of the house
 
05:13:31.670 --> 05:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
of representatives
 
05:13:33.430 --> 05:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
i think it should be at least one
 
05:13:35.910 --> 05:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee member um from environment and
 
05:13:35.920 --> 05:13:37.590 align:start position:0%
committee member um from environment and
agriculture

05:13:37.590 --> 05:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
that is true often study committees
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
with legislative study committees will
 
05:13:44.470 --> 05:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
identify uh which committees the members
 
05:13:45.830 --> 05:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
should be coming from
 
05:13:47.750 --> 05:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
that that is true
 
05:13:50.628 --> 05:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
right and um just to follow up with that
 
05:13:52.470 --> 05:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
um it should be one
 
05:13:54.788 --> 05:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
you know it should be a republican a
 
05:13:57.030 --> 05:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
democrat and maybe another republican
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
from both sides yeah generally they
 
05:14:00.708 --> 05:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
don't do that it's really based on the
 
05:14:03.270 --> 05:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
leadership so if i had a guess this you
 
05:14:03.280 --> 05:14:03.990 align:start position:0%
leadership so if i had a guess this you
know

05:14:03.990 --> 05:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:14:04.000 --> 05:14:04.948 align:start position:0%
know
um

05:14:04.948 --> 05:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:07.590 --> 05:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
usually well the senate is you know you
 
05:14:09.670 --> 05:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
know but usually it would it would be
 
05:14:11.590 --> 05:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
two members of the house two one member
 
05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh who were republican one uh if
 
05:14:16.470 --> 05:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
given right now the majority and then
 
05:14:18.390 --> 05:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
but they generally normally would look
 
05:14:20.868 --> 05:14:20.878 align:start position:0%
at the committee the bill is coming from
 
05:14:22.948 --> 05:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
but you're right that having the fact
 
05:14:24.868 --> 05:14:24.878 align:start position:0%
that it's coming here to commerce
 
05:14:27.430 --> 05:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
rather than having um
 
05:14:30.868 --> 05:14:30.878 align:start position:0%
have it going it through through uh
 
05:14:30.878 --> 05:14:31.670 align:start position:0%
have it going it through through uh
the

05:14:31.670 --> 05:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:14:34.150 --> 05:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture or e-dna
 
05:14:36.150 --> 05:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
that matter because of licensure you
 
05:14:37.590 --> 05:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
know in terms of whether we should want
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
licensure but usually edna
 
05:14:42.948 --> 05:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
licensure is a secondary first we it's
 
05:14:45.430 --> 05:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
the the committee that's most involved
 
05:14:47.670 --> 05:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
in the issue they think it's a good idea
 
05:14:49.830 --> 05:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
then it goes to you dna to they are
 
05:14:51.910 --> 05:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
going to go forward with licensure but i
 
05:14:53.590 --> 05:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
it does really beg the question that
 
05:14:55.270 --> 05:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
maybe the right answer here is really a
 
05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
chapter i think a chapter study to get
 
05:15:00.310 --> 05:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
all the players involved um rather than
 
05:15:02.868 --> 05:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
a legislative one but what is a chapter
 
05:15:02.878 --> 05:15:03.750 align:start position:0%
a legislative one but what is a chapter
study

05:15:03.750 --> 05:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
study
 
05:15:06.230 --> 05:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
so a chapter study is a commission
 
05:15:08.230 --> 05:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
a chapter study would be a commission
 
05:15:10.868 --> 05:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
and then you have and the problem the
 
05:15:12.150 --> 05:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
problem with those chapter city
 
05:15:14.470 --> 05:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
commissions is is that you have a
 
05:15:16.070 --> 05:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
let's say you have a groomer or someone
 
05:15:17.750 --> 05:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor
 
05:15:19.670 --> 05:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay well does the governor get the
 
05:15:22.550 --> 05:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
appointment done in a tiny fashion so i
 
05:15:24.470 --> 05:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
assume that they in their wisdom they
 
05:15:25.830 --> 05:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
thought well this turned into a study
 
05:15:28.230 --> 05:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
committee to be quick but frankly this
 
05:15:30.310 --> 05:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
issue is probably more complicated so i
 
05:15:32.550 --> 05:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
would actually go with that commission
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
that a two-year commission in other
 
05:15:36.310 --> 05:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
words give them more time to really
 
05:15:37.670 --> 05:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
think it through
 
05:15:39.910 --> 05:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
and have all those players involved who
 
05:15:42.390 --> 05:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
are who are you know for it and
 
05:15:44.070 --> 05:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
that might be a better way to do it and
 
05:15:45.270 --> 05:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
maybe you wouldn't feel the time
 
05:15:46.948 --> 05:15:46.958 align:start position:0%
pressure uh and certainly would you
 
05:15:49.030 --> 05:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
didn't want um
 
05:15:50.948 --> 05:15:50.958 align:start position:0%
people who who are the groomers to feel
 
05:15:53.030 --> 05:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
like that they have to give their job to
 
05:15:54.470 --> 05:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
to do the commission
 
05:15:56.150 --> 05:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
you have further question
 
05:15:58.868 --> 05:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
well it's just a you know just a
 
05:16:00.948 --> 05:16:00.958 align:start position:0%
follow-up on the licensure i think there
 
05:16:03.190 --> 05:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
should also be someone um from the
 
05:16:05.670 --> 05:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
beauty industry on this committee or
 
05:16:08.868 --> 05:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
commission because they are licensed and
 
05:16:08.878 --> 05:16:09.750 align:start position:0%
commission because they are licensed and
they're

05:16:09.750 --> 05:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:16:09.760 --> 05:16:10.550 align:start position:0%
they're
not

05:16:10.550 --> 05:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:16:13.110 --> 05:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
unlike they don't they operate similar
 
05:16:16.868 --> 05:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
to groomers i hear you but uh you do
 
05:16:18.230 --> 05:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
know that a couple years ago there was a
 
05:16:21.110 --> 05:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
big move to get rid of uh that licensure
 
05:16:21.120 --> 05:16:22.948 align:start position:0%
big move to get rid of uh that licensure
requirement

05:16:22.948 --> 05:16:22.958 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:16:24.550 --> 05:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
represented macular
 
05:16:27.590 --> 05:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um hearing about
 
05:16:29.670 --> 05:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
these cages uh which i had never heard
 
05:16:31.990 --> 05:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
of before i i googled them
 
05:16:33.190 --> 05:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're pretty scary um there's an awful
 
05:16:38.310 --> 05:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
lot that can go wrong um it suggests
 
05:16:39.350 --> 05:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
that there
 
05:16:41.270 --> 05:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be somebody in the room all the
 
05:16:43.750 --> 05:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
time watching them there suggests that
 
05:16:45.990 --> 05:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
there need to be a thermometer that you
 
05:16:46.000 --> 05:16:47.590 align:start position:0%
there need to be a thermometer that you
could

05:16:47.590 --> 05:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:16:50.948 --> 05:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
see the temperature at all times um they
 
05:16:52.070 --> 05:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
scare me
 
05:16:56.230 --> 05:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
what is your opinion about maybe uh um
 
05:16:58.628 --> 05:16:58.638 align:start position:0%
one that fully cages a dog that type of
 
05:16:58.638 --> 05:16:59.830 align:start position:0%
one that fully cages a dog that type of
machine

05:16:59.830 --> 05:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
machine
 
05:17:02.708 --> 05:17:02.718 align:start position:0%
not be be allowed any opinion on that
 
05:17:04.470 --> 05:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
right so this question would be to you
 
05:17:04.480 --> 05:17:05.910 align:start position:0%
right so this question would be to you
dara

05:17:05.910 --> 05:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
dara
 
05:17:08.230 --> 05:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
yes i'm sorry yeah assume you've got
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
your your dogs okay okay
 
05:17:12.948 --> 05:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
did you hear the question
 
05:17:17.190 --> 05:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
i did yes yes so i
 
05:17:21.270 --> 05:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:21.280 --> 05:17:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:17:22.550 --> 05:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:25.110 --> 05:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's not all dryers but yes those cage
 
05:17:28.788 --> 05:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
dryers are are very difficult to
 
05:17:30.788 --> 05:17:30.798 align:start position:0%
to monitor and
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
you have to have
 
05:17:35.270 --> 05:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
enough stack and enough education
 
05:17:38.390 --> 05:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
to know how to use them properly they
 
05:17:41.430 --> 05:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
can be used properly and i'm not
 
05:17:43.910 --> 05:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
saying that they should be
 
05:17:46.788 --> 05:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
but they can be used properly in certain
 
05:17:46.798 --> 05:17:48.830 align:start position:0%
but they can be used properly in certain
settings

05:17:48.830 --> 05:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
settings
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
i'm not training students on them
 
05:17:55.110 --> 05:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
because we don't
 
05:17:57.110 --> 05:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
endorse them
 
05:17:57.120 --> 05:17:58.550 align:start position:0%
endorse them
so

05:17:58.550 --> 05:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:18:00.708 --> 05:18:00.718 align:start position:0%
ever again every place is going to be
 
05:18:03.430 --> 05:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
different i mean you can can say that
 
05:18:05.910 --> 05:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
they can't be used and most people i
 
05:18:09.750 --> 05:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
think would agree or most groomers would
 
05:18:11.510 --> 05:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
but you're going to have the backlash
 
05:18:13.510 --> 05:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
from those that have been doing it for
 
05:18:16.550 --> 05:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
30 years have been doing it for 40 years
 
05:18:18.948 --> 05:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
have been in the industry and they've
 
05:18:20.788 --> 05:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
done fine with it
 
05:18:20.798 --> 05:18:23.190 align:start position:0%
done fine with it
um

05:18:23.190 --> 05:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:26.628 --> 05:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
it is a very hot topic itself in our
 
05:18:26.638 --> 05:18:28.070 align:start position:0%
it is a very hot topic itself in our
industry

05:18:28.070 --> 05:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
industry
 
05:18:29.670 --> 05:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
05:18:31.510 --> 05:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
05:18:33.430 --> 05:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
anything that's not talked about
 
05:18:36.390 --> 05:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
throughout our industry and it's one of
 
05:18:36.400 --> 05:18:37.430 align:start position:0%
throughout our industry and it's one of
the

05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:18:39.750 --> 05:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
topics that we will be talking about in
 
05:18:43.520 --> 05:18:43.530 align:start position:0%
the uh groomer council
 
05:18:43.530 --> 05:18:48.788 align:start position:0%
the uh groomer council
[Music]

05:18:48.788 --> 05:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:50.708 --> 05:18:50.718 align:start position:0%
um all right so i have gone through
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
everybody who had originally signed up
 
05:18:55.590 --> 05:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
to speak i have two people who are
 
05:18:58.470 --> 05:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
who are now asking to speak i would ask
 
05:19:00.868 --> 05:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
them to i'm going to call up nancy
 
05:19:00.878 --> 05:19:03.750 align:start position:0%
them to i'm going to call up nancy
messette

05:19:03.750 --> 05:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:05.510 --> 05:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
and then there's another one m fisher
 
05:19:07.590 --> 05:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
which i'll call on a second i would ask
 
05:19:08.948 --> 05:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
well i have to wait because i know
 
05:19:11.670 --> 05:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
there's a blackout moment here
 
05:19:13.830 --> 05:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon nancy uh you didn't
 
05:19:15.750 --> 05:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
sign up we are a little bit behind but
 
05:19:18.150 --> 05:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
so i hope you can
 
05:19:20.550 --> 05:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
you can uh give us a be succinct in the
 
05:19:26.230 --> 05:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:27.750 --> 05:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
there is a delay i don't know this is
 
05:19:29.030 --> 05:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
the way i tried it this is why i try to
 
05:19:31.030 --> 05:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
bring people up ahead of time and then
 
05:19:41.510 --> 05:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:44.310 --> 05:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
we have not done well today
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
is she from northampton too
 
05:19:51.990 --> 05:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:54.070 --> 05:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
if i could speak just for a minute or
 
05:19:56.150 --> 05:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
second i don't think nancy is prepared
 
05:19:58.628 --> 05:19:58.638 align:start position:0%
to she's in the middle of her um
 
05:20:00.788 --> 05:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
her shop business right now i think she
 
05:20:02.708 --> 05:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
was hoping that jim might be able to
 
05:20:05.350 --> 05:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
speak for her she just sent me a text
 
05:20:05.360 --> 05:20:06.628 align:start position:0%

uh so again thank you members of the
 
05:20:31.990 --> 05:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is nancy mastid owner
 
05:20:33.910 --> 05:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
of indognito incorporated grooming
 
05:20:36.550 --> 05:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
studio located at 892 lafayette road in
 
05:20:38.868 --> 05:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
hampton yes the former location of mrs
 
05:20:41.030 --> 05:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
doolittle's bath house this is the
 
05:20:42.708 --> 05:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
location where teddy the five-year-old
 
05:20:44.628 --> 05:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
golden retriever belonging to joanne
 
05:20:47.430 --> 05:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
trophy lost his life to to unfortunate
 
05:20:49.030 --> 05:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
and preventable circumstances i have
 
05:20:50.628 --> 05:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
been in this industry as a pet groomer
 
05:20:52.470 --> 05:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
for almost 30 years and i was a
 
05:20:54.390 --> 05:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
veterinary technician for several years
 
05:20:56.550 --> 05:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
and i am also a licensed cosmetologist
 
05:20:59.190 --> 05:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
for over 15 years my passion in life is
 
05:21:00.628 --> 05:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
animals but my heart is in the
 
05:21:02.310 --> 05:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
caregiving for dogs and cats in all
 
05:21:03.910 --> 05:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
areas of their lives that is why this
 
05:21:06.470 --> 05:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
bill is so important to me dogs die in
 
05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
grooming shops every day of the year
 
05:21:10.628 --> 05:21:10.638 align:start position:0%
groomers are injured every day of the
 
05:21:12.470 --> 05:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
year but it should not be from such
 
05:21:14.310 --> 05:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
things as poor education and lack of
 
05:21:16.550 --> 05:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
proper training it should not be from

05:23:17.590 --> 05:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
mrs doolittles after she closed the
 
05:23:19.430 --> 05:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
smell alone had me thinking twice about
 
05:23:21.830 --> 05:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
the endeavor i was about to add to my
 
05:23:23.750 --> 05:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
already full plate i wanted to create a
 
05:23:26.470 --> 05:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
safe clean salon with cameras with
 
05:23:29.350 --> 05:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
camera safety camera systems safe spaces
 
05:23:31.110 --> 05:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
for pets and staff i gutted the place
 
05:23:33.270 --> 05:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
from top to bottom and insist on my
 
05:23:35.270 --> 05:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
staff continuing education even during
 
05:23:37.510 --> 05:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
these difficult times i wanted to place
 
05:23:38.948 --> 05:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
i wanted a place that someone like
 
05:23:40.708 --> 05:23:40.718 align:start position:0%
joanne would know that when she was
 
05:23:42.868 --> 05:23:42.878 align:start position:0%
ready she could feel comfortable and
 
05:23:45.910 --> 05:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
safe leaving her beloved new family when
 
05:23:47.510 --> 05:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
she was gone
 
05:23:47.520 --> 05:23:48.788 align:start position:0%
she was gone
um

05:23:48.788 --> 05:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:50.868 --> 05:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
i understand that attempting to license
 
05:23:52.470 --> 05:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
individual groomers is attached to great
 
05:23:56.310 --> 05:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
cost and the time and time so i have
 
05:23:58.070 --> 05:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
i do have a few thoughts of other
 
05:23:59.670 --> 05:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
possible options that can start a
 
05:24:01.190 --> 05:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
process of accountability which is
 
05:24:02.550 --> 05:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
something groomers do not have and
 
05:24:04.470 --> 05:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
honestly most groomers do not want
 
05:24:05.910 --> 05:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
because they don't want big brother
 
05:24:07.350 --> 05:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
telling them what to do and they don't
 
05:24:08.708 --> 05:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
want to have to spend money bringing
 
05:24:10.550 --> 05:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
their facility standards
 
05:24:12.550 --> 05:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
bringing their facility standards where
 
05:24:14.070 --> 05:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
they should be i believe that we can
 
05:24:15.990 --> 05:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
make some of the responsibilities fall
 
05:24:17.590 --> 05:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
on the individual individual salon
 
05:24:19.590 --> 05:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
owners including mobile groomers i
 
05:24:21.430 --> 05:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
believe if we start with grooming salon
 
05:24:23.190 --> 05:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
registration systems where the salons
 
05:24:24.628 --> 05:24:24.638 align:start position:0%
are registered they can then register
 
05:24:26.708 --> 05:24:26.718 align:start position:0%
their employees and that will hold them
 
05:24:28.550 --> 05:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
to some extent to the liability and make
 
05:24:30.628 --> 05:24:30.638 align:start position:0%
them think twice for whom they choose to
 
05:24:30.638 --> 05:24:31.590 align:start position:0%
them think twice for whom they choose to
hire

05:24:31.590 --> 05:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
hire
 
05:24:33.030 --> 05:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
shops should be inspected at least once
 
05:24:34.470 --> 05:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
a year i believe hair salons are
 
05:24:34.480 --> 05:24:35.670 align:start position:0%
a year i believe hair salons are
expected

05:24:35.670 --> 05:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
expected
 
05:24:37.350 --> 05:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
twice a year
 
05:24:38.788 --> 05:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
shops including mobile units will have
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
to meet certain standards for
 
05:24:41.510 --> 05:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
cleanliness equipment
 
05:24:44.390 --> 05:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
and or vehicle maintenance sds books i
 
05:24:46.390 --> 05:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
think that should be msds books all
 
05:24:48.868 --> 05:24:48.878 align:start position:0%
employees are current on cpr first aid
 
05:24:50.788 --> 05:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
certification in our industry the
 
05:24:52.390 --> 05:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
certification is usually good for two
 
05:24:54.230 --> 05:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
years proof of insurance proper
 
05:24:56.948 --> 05:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
sanitation is being done and proper
 
05:24:59.030 --> 05:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
labeling and storage of products for
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
groomers that choose to use drying cages
 
05:25:02.948 --> 05:25:02.958 align:start position:0%
they must be in their sight lines at all
 
05:25:04.470 --> 05:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
times so they cannot so that they can
 
05:25:06.310 --> 05:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
monitor the pet's condition
 
05:25:07.750 --> 05:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
and must be well maintained for safety
 
05:25:09.590 --> 05:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
reasons many pets die in these types of
 
05:25:11.590 --> 05:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
cages every year i also strongly believe
 
05:25:13.190 --> 05:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
that if pets are not kept within strong
 
05:25:15.270 --> 05:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
sight lines at all times the salon
 
05:25:16.470 --> 05:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
should be required to have a camera
 
05:25:18.948 --> 05:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
system in place to maintain safe visuals
 
05:25:20.390 --> 05:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
on the pets salons should be able to
 
05:25:21.830 --> 05:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
maintain a good heating and cooling
 
05:25:23.430 --> 05:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
system that provides adequate climate
 
05:25:25.510 --> 05:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
control per the square footage of their
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
space that should not be left alone in
 
05:25:28.948 --> 05:25:28.958 align:start position:0%
the building unless the facility is set
 
05:25:31.190 --> 05:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
up and licensed as a kennel
 
05:25:33.190 --> 05:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
and also meets the established safety
 
05:25:35.110 --> 05:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
requirements if the facility does not
 
05:25:37.110 --> 05:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
pass inspection they can be given a
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
sheet on what needs to be fixed or
 
05:25:40.150 --> 05:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
changed and given a grace period to fix
 
05:25:42.550 --> 05:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
these problems or be fined based on the
 
05:25:44.550 --> 05:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
demerits they receive
 
05:25:45.830 --> 05:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
what happened to teddy was not only
 
05:25:47.590 --> 05:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking but completely preventable
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
he was used and left in an airline style
 
05:25:52.550 --> 05:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
thick plastic crate with a very
 
05:25:55.350 --> 05:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
non-maintained dryer blowing hot air in
 
05:25:56.708 --> 05:25:56.718 align:start position:0%
the front of the crate during the summer
 
05:25:58.470 --> 05:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
months where he was already a problem
 
05:26:00.708 --> 05:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
mrs bessemer then left the building for
 
05:26:02.150 --> 05:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
an extended time we all know what
 
05:26:04.628 --> 05:26:04.638 align:start position:0%
happened next let's find a compromise to
 
05:26:06.150 --> 05:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
keep this and other tragedies from
 
05:26:07.910 --> 05:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
happening again
 
05:26:11.110 --> 05:26:11.120 align:start position:0%

commission
 
05:27:00.628 --> 05:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
uh two-year commission working with all
 
05:27:02.390 --> 05:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
the folks that you did
 
05:27:04.310 --> 05:27:04.320 align:start position:0%

on that kind of commission
 
05:27:07.750 --> 05:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
05:27:09.350 --> 05:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
question i'd be more than happy to do
 
05:27:11.670 --> 05:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
that um and and i would i would defer to
 
05:27:14.150 --> 05:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
the wisdom of of the committee the chair
 
05:27:15.990 --> 05:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
about whether that's an amendment or if
 
05:27:17.910 --> 05:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
you retain this so that can be changed
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
but i defer and would be more than
 
05:27:22.628 --> 05:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
welcome to change it to a commission
 
05:27:24.788 --> 05:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
all right so yes i did get to him and my
 
05:27:26.628 --> 05:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
preference would be is we would retain
 
05:27:27.670 --> 05:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
it and then we would create the
 
05:27:29.430 --> 05:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
commission in the fall and that way we
 
05:27:32.070 --> 05:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
make sure we cover all our bases
 
05:27:33.190 --> 05:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
05:27:34.390 --> 05:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not supposed to tell you what i
 
05:27:34.400 --> 05:27:35.590 align:start position:0%
i'm not supposed to tell you what i
think

05:27:35.590 --> 05:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:27:36.948 --> 05:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
05:27:40.548 --> 05:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
uh so martin martin fisher is the last
 
05:27:49.670 --> 05:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:52.788 --> 05:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
yeah you're a dog barking
 
05:27:59.270 --> 05:27:59.280 align:start position:0%

commitment

the commerce committee is familiar with

the right to repair
 
05:30:14.788 --> 05:30:14.798 align:start position:0%
legislation from past sessions which
 
05:30:16.548 --> 05:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
under both republican and democratic
 
05:30:19.110 --> 05:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
leadership has resulted in favorable
 
05:30:21.830 --> 05:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
reports following interim study
 
05:30:24.390 --> 05:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
concern has been on product scope and
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
access to proprietary information
 
05:30:28.548 --> 05:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
whether owned by the user or the
 
05:30:28.558 --> 05:30:30.390 align:start position:0%
whether owned by the user or the
manufacturer

05:30:30.390 --> 05:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
05:30:33.270 --> 05:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
here the scope in this bill is limited
 
05:30:36.070 --> 05:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
to appliances like washers and dryers
 
05:30:37.910 --> 05:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
an area that's become very important
 
05:30:40.070 --> 05:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
05:30:42.548 --> 05:30:42.558 align:start position:0%
and the bill addresses access to
 
05:30:45.670 --> 05:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
information on fair and reasonable terms
 
05:30:48.230 --> 05:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
and only the information necessary to
 
05:30:50.470 --> 05:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
repair the appliance
 
05:30:52.310 --> 05:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
you may want to hear from others after

representative bartlett
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
i guess oh representative abramson
 
05:31:12.070 --> 05:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
he's gonna take his chance
 
05:31:13.750 --> 05:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
so you do realize he's not the prime
 
05:31:15.350 --> 05:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this building yes
 
05:31:15.360 --> 05:31:16.708 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this building yes
but

05:31:16.708 --> 05:31:16.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going for in intent
 
05:31:21.830 --> 05:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh or maybe just to draw attention to it
 
05:31:23.350 --> 05:31:23.360 align:start position:0%

the one where it paid your line
 
05:31:53.910 --> 05:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
no don't use page online use what the
 
05:31:55.990 --> 05:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
rsa reference
 
05:31:57.510 --> 05:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
yeah it's uh
 
05:32:00.070 --> 05:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
by itself it says 358-t
 
05:32:02.628 --> 05:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
section three requirements d3 that's the
 
05:32:05.750 --> 05:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
actual statute yes 358 t
 
05:32:07.670 --> 05:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
i see definitions
 
05:32:10.470 --> 05:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
yeah t3 is is the actual
 
05:32:12.788 --> 05:32:12.798 align:start position:0%
see requirements got it got it okay it
 
05:32:15.270 --> 05:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
says for home appliances and repair for
 
05:32:17.910 --> 05:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
such appliances sold or used in this
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
state an original appliance manufacturer
 
05:32:21.670 --> 05:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
shall make available and so forth
 
05:32:23.830 --> 05:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
my concern is we have
 
05:32:26.788 --> 05:32:26.798 align:start position:0%
in seabrook we have some
 
05:32:28.628 --> 05:32:28.638 align:start position:0%
second hand
 
05:32:30.470 --> 05:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
providers and we have people who sell
 
05:32:32.070 --> 05:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
things second secondhand we have we have
 
05:32:33.910 --> 05:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
both companies and individuals who sell
 
05:32:35.910 --> 05:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
them so would that mean that this is
 
05:32:37.430 --> 05:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
going to apply
 
05:32:39.590 --> 05:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh i believe that it does should apply
 
05:32:42.548 --> 05:32:42.558 align:start position:0%
if they're selling something
 
05:32:45.990 --> 05:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
how so how could a manufacturer
 
05:32:47.270 --> 05:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
if they don't want to comply with this
 
05:32:48.868 --> 05:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
or not able to comply with this how
 
05:32:50.150 --> 05:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
would they prevent
 
05:32:51.670 --> 05:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
those appliances from being sold in new
 
05:32:51.680 --> 05:32:53.590 align:start position:0%
those appliances from being sold in new
hampshire

05:32:53.590 --> 05:32:53.600 align:start position:0%

05:32:58.868 --> 05:32:58.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:04.470 --> 05:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:04.480 --> 05:33:05.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:33:05.430 --> 05:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:33:10.708 --> 05:33:10.718 align:start position:0%
um all right so uh normally we do is um
 
05:33:13.350 --> 05:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh state representatives first so uh
 
05:33:16.070 --> 05:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
eric gallacher is that i all i see is
 
05:33:18.150 --> 05:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
eric is that you eric
 
05:33:19.910 --> 05:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
eric gallagher if that's you put your
 
05:33:22.230 --> 05:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
hand up so because you did sign up to
 
05:33:22.240 --> 05:33:24.470 align:start position:0%
hand up so because you did sign up to
speak

05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
speak
 
05:33:24.480 --> 05:33:27.350 align:start position:0%
speak
to

05:33:27.350 --> 05:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:27.360 --> 05:33:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh eric

05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:29.910 --> 05:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
maybe not okay
 
05:33:35.910 --> 05:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
so um so the next uh i will have is um
 
05:33:38.708 --> 05:33:38.718 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill let's see
 
05:33:40.628 --> 05:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
okay here we go um
 
05:33:42.628 --> 05:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
all right so this is
 
05:33:46.150 --> 05:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
gay gordon burn who
 
05:33:48.868 --> 05:33:48.878 align:start position:0%
is a repair organization and it's in
 
05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:58.150 --> 05:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
so all you have to do is uh unmute
 
05:34:01.190 --> 05:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
yourself yep i'm unmuting and starting
 
05:34:03.990 --> 05:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
my video yeah you got it there you go
 
05:34:06.150 --> 05:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
perfect hello
 
05:34:07.670 --> 05:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
well it's great to be here thank you
 
05:34:08.948 --> 05:34:08.958 align:start position:0%
chairman haughton members of the
 
05:34:11.830 --> 05:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
committee um been there before sorry i
 
05:34:13.830 --> 05:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
can't go and enjoy the centennial hotel
 
05:34:16.310 --> 05:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
again because i love that place
 
05:34:19.910 --> 05:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh but uh happy to be here anyway
 
05:34:21.750 --> 05:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
we focused this year okay let me just
 
05:34:23.270 --> 05:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
back up for those who don't know where
 
05:34:25.190 --> 05:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
are you from yeah where are you from and
 
05:34:27.910 --> 05:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
where okay yeah uh gay gordon byrne i'm
 
05:34:29.830 --> 05:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the repair
 
05:34:33.430 --> 05:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
association um also known as repair.org
 
05:34:35.830 --> 05:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
because that's our uh website we are a
 
05:34:39.590 --> 05:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
nonprofit we're now over 450 members
 
05:34:41.110 --> 05:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
most of our members are either small
 
05:34:42.868 --> 05:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
repair businesses or they are trade
 
05:34:45.910 --> 05:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
associations in the business of repair
 
05:34:48.628 --> 05:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
and a number of our affiliates are
 
05:34:51.590 --> 05:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
groups that are more focused on consumer
 
05:34:53.270 --> 05:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
protection and consumer rights in
 
05:34:53.280 --> 05:34:54.230 align:start position:0%
protection and consumer rights in
general

05:34:54.230 --> 05:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
general
 
05:34:56.230 --> 05:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to talk about why we're
 
05:34:59.190 --> 05:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
talking about appliances and for me it's
 
05:35:01.750 --> 05:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
because two years ago um i was in
 
05:35:03.910 --> 05:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
testimony in vermont for this very same
 
05:35:05.910 --> 05:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
bill that you looked at two years ago
 
05:35:08.310 --> 05:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the people that was there
 
05:35:10.310 --> 05:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
was testifying about how people
 
05:35:11.510 --> 05:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be able to repair their
 
05:35:14.390 --> 05:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
appliances and the senator said uh well
 
05:35:16.628 --> 05:35:16.638 align:start position:0%
what's the useful life of a refrigerator
 
05:35:19.670 --> 05:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
and the answer was 12 years uh
 
05:35:22.708 --> 05:35:22.718 align:start position:0%
20 years but now 12 and the difference
 
05:35:24.628 --> 05:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
being that the presence of electronics
 
05:35:26.708 --> 05:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
and refrigerators has dramatically
 
05:35:29.590 --> 05:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
dropped the useful life of refrigerators
 
05:35:30.948 --> 05:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty scary to me as a
 
05:35:30.958 --> 05:35:32.230 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty scary to me as a
consumer

05:35:32.230 --> 05:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
05:35:34.708 --> 05:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
my refrigerator the last one i had it
 
05:35:36.868 --> 05:35:36.878 align:start position:0%
was 20 or 20 years old when i bought the
 
05:35:36.878 --> 05:35:38.548 align:start position:0%
was 20 or 20 years old when i bought the
house

05:35:38.548 --> 05:35:38.558 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:35:41.110 --> 05:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
and uh it did have a failure and i was
 
05:35:43.110 --> 05:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
able to get a local repair tech in he
 
05:35:45.190 --> 05:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
charged 80 bucks for the service call
 
05:35:48.390 --> 05:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
and like 25 bucks for the thermostat and
 
05:35:50.708 --> 05:35:50.718 align:start position:0%
uh i asked him i said so what about the
 
05:35:53.350 --> 05:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
electronic thermostats and he says oh my
 
05:35:54.708 --> 05:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
god they're awful they break all the
 
05:35:54.718 --> 05:35:55.910 align:start position:0%
god they're awful they break all the
time

05:35:55.910 --> 05:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm like a little bit clued into the
 
05:35:59.990 --> 05:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
fact that there's a specific uh
 
05:36:02.708 --> 05:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
durability problem with major appliances
 
05:36:04.868 --> 05:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
that didn't used to exist
 
05:36:06.310 --> 05:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
i think they used to be called durable
 
05:36:09.510 --> 05:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
goods but they are far from durable now
 
05:36:11.270 --> 05:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
and from the electronics standpoint
 
05:36:13.030 --> 05:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
they're almost all doomed
 
05:36:15.750 --> 05:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
because as soon as you put a capacitor
 
05:36:17.670 --> 05:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
on a circuit board those are essentially
 
05:36:19.670 --> 05:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
teeny-weeny little batteries those
 
05:36:21.830 --> 05:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
things dry out they always fail just a
 
05:36:23.510 --> 05:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
matter of how long it is before they
 
05:36:26.628 --> 05:36:26.638 align:start position:0%
fail so you're now putting parts that
 
05:36:29.590 --> 05:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
are guaranteed to fail into expensive
 
05:36:31.110 --> 05:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
consumer products
 
05:36:33.190 --> 05:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
and then if you don't make provision for
 
05:36:35.510 --> 05:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
getting them repaired more easily
 
05:36:37.590 --> 05:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
they then become a real burden on the
 
05:36:37.600 --> 05:36:38.788 align:start position:0%
they then become a real burden on the
consumer

05:36:38.788 --> 05:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
05:36:41.350 --> 05:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
and a real excessive cost for people
 
05:36:43.110 --> 05:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
that really probably couldn't afford
 
05:36:45.190 --> 05:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
brand new in the first place i mean if i
 
05:36:47.110 --> 05:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
had to put my house on the market and
 
05:36:48.788 --> 05:36:48.798 align:start position:0%
only sell it with brand new appliances i
 
05:36:50.548 --> 05:36:50.558 align:start position:0%
think it would be very expensive
 
05:36:52.470 --> 05:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
and then i'm turning around
 
05:36:54.070 --> 05:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
and getting a mortgage which includes
 
05:36:55.750 --> 05:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
the cost of those appliances so it's
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
very pernicious if we can't repair these
 
05:36:59.510 --> 05:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
large things
 
05:37:00.948 --> 05:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
some of them are larger than others
 
05:37:04.230 --> 05:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
obviously if my toaster breaks um
 
05:37:06.390 --> 05:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
and i have tried to fix my toaster
 
05:37:08.788 --> 05:37:08.798 align:start position:0%
it's not the big it's or it's not a big
 
05:37:10.708 --> 05:37:10.718 align:start position:0%
deal but if my refrigerator breaks
 
05:37:13.110 --> 05:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
that's a very big deal to me because a i
 
05:37:15.990 --> 05:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
need to keep my food cold and b i know
 
05:37:18.948 --> 05:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
that if repair is going to be 500 and
 
05:37:21.110 --> 05:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
the new refrigerator is a thousand now
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
now i'm in the market for another
 
05:37:24.868 --> 05:37:24.878 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar item
 
05:37:26.390 --> 05:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:37:28.310 --> 05:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
not everybody can afford that the other
 
05:37:29.510 --> 05:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
problem that we're seeing is that with
 
05:37:30.708 --> 05:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
05:37:32.150 --> 05:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of repair actually
 
05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
going on there's a lot of need for
 
05:37:35.750 --> 05:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
repair but a lot of restraint um you
 
05:37:37.750 --> 05:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
know technicians aren't traveling
 
05:37:40.070 --> 05:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
people aren't welcoming people into
 
05:37:42.150 --> 05:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
their homes they're not able to go to
 
05:37:44.390 --> 05:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
the store and buy a new thing because a
 
05:37:46.628 --> 05:37:46.638 align:start position:0%
the stores don't have any uh and for
 
05:37:49.190 --> 05:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
quite a period of time the stores closed
 
05:37:49.200 --> 05:37:49.990 align:start position:0%
quite a period of time the stores closed
so

05:37:49.990 --> 05:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:37:52.150 --> 05:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
the options have really been shrinking
 
05:37:54.070 --> 05:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
and if we don't have the opportunity to
 
05:37:55.670 --> 05:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
repair these things
 
05:37:57.910 --> 05:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
um and that opportunity has been
 
05:37:59.590 --> 05:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
shrinking then i think we're really in a
 
05:38:01.030 --> 05:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
lot of trouble
 
05:38:01.040 --> 05:38:02.230 align:start position:0%
lot of trouble
um

05:38:02.230 --> 05:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:02.240 --> 05:38:03.270 align:start position:0%
um
another

05:38:03.270 --> 05:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:38:05.190 --> 05:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
problem that's cropped up with home
 
05:38:06.788 --> 05:38:06.798 align:start position:0%
appliances as it has with other
 
05:38:09.430 --> 05:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
equipment is that parts are now being
 
05:38:09.440 --> 05:38:10.390 align:start position:0%
equipment is that parts are now being
paired

05:38:10.390 --> 05:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
paired
 
05:38:13.110 --> 05:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
so you could buy a brand new thermostat
 
05:38:16.150 --> 05:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
from ge a friend of mine did this
 
05:38:18.708 --> 05:38:18.718 align:start position:0%
go to put it in and have the thermostat
 
05:38:20.708 --> 05:38:20.718 align:start position:0%
say input password
 
05:38:22.470 --> 05:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
and since he looks at the packaging
 
05:38:24.310 --> 05:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
materials can't find the password calls
 
05:38:24.320 --> 05:38:25.270 align:start position:0%
materials can't find the password calls
ge

05:38:25.270 --> 05:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
ge
 
05:38:27.510 --> 05:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
and says okay i need the password g he
 
05:38:29.830 --> 05:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
says no we won't give you the password
 
05:38:32.310 --> 05:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
you have to call a ge authorized service
 
05:38:34.310 --> 05:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
technician to come out to your home and
 
05:38:36.788 --> 05:38:36.798 align:start position:0%
insert the password now this wasn't as
 
05:38:38.708 --> 05:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
easy as you might think because the plot
 
05:38:40.548 --> 05:38:40.558 align:start position:0%
the place where his refrigerator was in
 
05:38:43.190 --> 05:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
florida and he lives in massachusetts so
 
05:38:45.270 --> 05:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
to go let somebody in the door to do a
 
05:38:48.230 --> 05:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
password thing a silly password thing
 
05:38:49.750 --> 05:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
was not as simple as it might have
 
05:38:51.430 --> 05:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
sounded and that is going on very
 
05:38:53.910 --> 05:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
broadly and it's probably going to kill
 
05:38:55.350 --> 05:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of repairs
 
05:38:57.670 --> 05:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
that are currently available and make
 
05:39:00.628 --> 05:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
them impossible so we have to anticipate
 
05:39:02.070 --> 05:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
that the market is moving in a very
 
05:39:04.310 --> 05:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
negative direction when it comes to our
 
05:39:06.708 --> 05:39:06.718 align:start position:0%
collective ability to keep the things we
 
05:39:08.788 --> 05:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
have in use
 
05:39:11.190 --> 05:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
now just to make it clear because this
 
05:39:13.030 --> 05:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't always come through clearly
 
05:39:16.868 --> 05:39:16.878 align:start position:0%
repair is only restoration that's it
 
05:39:18.470 --> 05:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
the only thing that anybody needs to
 
05:39:21.270 --> 05:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
repair things is they have to know what
 
05:39:22.868 --> 05:39:22.878 align:start position:0%
the error codes mean so they probably
 
05:39:25.350 --> 05:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
need documentation
 
05:39:27.110 --> 05:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
they need the diagnostic tools to be
 
05:39:29.030 --> 05:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
able to figure out what the actual
 
05:39:30.548 --> 05:39:30.558 align:start position:0%
failure is
 
05:39:33.670 --> 05:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
i know when my dishwasher broke um i had
 
05:39:36.390 --> 05:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
a light that said e8 and i had
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
documentation and said e8 said there was
 
05:39:39.910 --> 05:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
a clog
 
05:39:41.830 --> 05:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
and there was actually a clog and i was
 
05:39:44.070 --> 05:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
able to clear the clog and get the thing
 
05:39:46.230 --> 05:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
back but if i didn't have that
 
05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
information i wouldn't be able to do it
 
05:39:49.590 --> 05:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
i would have had a service technician
 
05:39:51.510 --> 05:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
come out god knows what they would have
 
05:39:51.520 --> 05:39:52.948 align:start position:0%
come out god knows what they would have
charged

05:39:52.948 --> 05:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
charged
 
05:39:55.190 --> 05:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
and there's no benefit for me not having
 
05:39:57.030 --> 05:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
that documentation other than the fact
 
05:39:59.510 --> 05:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
the service tech who i assume is getting
 
05:40:01.350 --> 05:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
paid nicely
 
05:40:03.430 --> 05:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
gets a service call
 
05:40:05.750 --> 05:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
so you need the doc the documentation
 
05:40:08.070 --> 05:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
you need the diagnostics the diagnostics
 
05:40:09.590 --> 05:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
are created
 
05:40:11.670 --> 05:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
specifically to make it easy
 
05:40:13.670 --> 05:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
to repair because manufacturers don't
 
05:40:13.680 --> 05:40:14.948 align:start position:0%
to repair because manufacturers don't
just

05:40:14.948 --> 05:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:40:14.958 --> 05:40:15.990 align:start position:0%
just
have

05:40:15.990 --> 05:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:40:17.750 --> 05:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
they have a warranty obligation they
 
05:40:19.030 --> 05:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
promise that they're going to fix this
 
05:40:21.110 --> 05:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
stuff for a period of time so their
 
05:40:22.628 --> 05:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
business model is they have to be able
 
05:40:24.948 --> 05:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
to support their in warranty service at
 
05:40:27.510 --> 05:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
a reasonable cost so they create these
 
05:40:27.520 --> 05:40:28.390 align:start position:0%
a reasonable cost so they create these
tools

05:40:28.390 --> 05:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
tools
 
05:40:30.948 --> 05:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
called diagnostics to make that easy so
 
05:40:32.310 --> 05:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
the technician just plugs in the
 
05:40:34.868 --> 05:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
diagnostics finds out what's wrong
 
05:40:36.788 --> 05:40:36.798 align:start position:0%
orders the part maybe the parts in the
 
05:40:38.548 --> 05:40:38.558 align:start position:0%
truck maybe it's overnight maybe it's a
 
05:40:41.030 --> 05:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
week puts the part back in
 
05:40:43.910 --> 05:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
reruns the diagnostics to make sure that
 
05:40:46.788 --> 05:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
the failure is cleared and then that's
 
05:40:46.798 --> 05:40:48.470 align:start position:0%
the failure is cleared and then that's
it

05:40:48.470 --> 05:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:40:50.628 --> 05:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
here's your bill
 
05:40:53.190 --> 05:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
off you go so everything else that's
 
05:40:55.750 --> 05:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
what this bill is asking for is asking
 
05:40:57.910 --> 05:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
for fair and reasonable access on fair
 
05:41:01.430 --> 05:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
and reasonable prices to those specific
 
05:41:03.830 --> 05:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
diagnostics documentation parts and
 
05:41:06.628 --> 05:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
tools that are necessary for repair
 
05:41:08.390 --> 05:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
everything else outside of that is not
 
05:41:10.948 --> 05:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
repair it may be frightening you may
 
05:41:12.708 --> 05:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
hear some really really crazy stories
 
05:41:14.948 --> 05:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
because we have definitely heard some
 
05:41:14.958 --> 05:41:15.830 align:start position:0%
because we have definitely heard some
um

05:41:15.830 --> 05:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:17.430 --> 05:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know there are some i wouldn't be
 
05:41:19.110 --> 05:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
surprised at all we used to call it
 
05:41:20.788 --> 05:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
entertainment hour when some of our
 
05:41:22.708 --> 05:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
opposition testimony would come up and
 
05:41:24.868 --> 05:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
start saying oh children are going to
 
05:41:26.470 --> 05:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
lose their arms getting ripped off and
 
05:41:27.670 --> 05:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
washing in
 
05:41:29.910 --> 05:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
washing machines or microwaves are going
 
05:41:33.110 --> 05:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
to explode or there's gas
 
05:41:35.750 --> 05:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
gas and you know unspecified gas
 
05:41:35.760 --> 05:41:36.788 align:start position:0%
gas and you know unspecified gas
somewhere

05:41:36.788 --> 05:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
05:41:38.548 --> 05:41:38.558 align:start position:0%
and those are just a parade of horribles
 
05:41:38.558 --> 05:41:39.270 align:start position:0%
and those are just a parade of horribles
that

05:41:39.270 --> 05:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't actually tie to repair they tie to
 
05:41:44.230 --> 05:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
frightening legislators and that's their
 
05:41:46.788 --> 05:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
whole purpose because if people have
 
05:41:48.788 --> 05:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
access to the same documentation parts
 
05:41:51.990 --> 05:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
and tools and let's say ideally it's not
 
05:41:54.150 --> 05:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
in the statute but ideally they should
 
05:41:56.150 --> 05:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
be able to get the same training or
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
there can be a trade school that
 
05:41:59.830 --> 05:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
provides training or community college
 
05:42:01.910 --> 05:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
that provides training or on-the-job
 
05:42:03.990 --> 05:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
training this is not really rocket
 
05:42:04.000 --> 05:42:05.430 align:start position:0%
training this is not really rocket
science

05:42:05.430 --> 05:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
science
 
05:42:07.190 --> 05:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
the people that are normally hired to do
 
05:42:09.110 --> 05:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
appliance repair they're not phd
 
05:42:12.150 --> 05:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
electrical engineers they tend to be 20
 
05:42:14.310 --> 05:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
an hour technicians
 
05:42:16.948 --> 05:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
much like the same pay scale you see in
 
05:42:19.030 --> 05:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
an automotive
 
05:42:21.110 --> 05:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
repair location
 
05:42:24.310 --> 05:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
so um that's what's going on with repair
 
05:42:26.390 --> 05:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's why we need it i own a bunch of
 
05:42:27.990 --> 05:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
appliances that are really really
 
05:42:31.270 --> 05:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
overpriced and if i can't get them fixed
 
05:42:33.590 --> 05:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
um it's gonna cost me a lot so even
 
05:42:35.030 --> 05:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
though i'm in new york state not new
 
05:42:37.350 --> 05:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire if i could buy what i need to
 
05:42:39.510 --> 05:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
repair my stuff in new hampshire i would
 
05:42:41.350 --> 05:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
really want to be able to do that and i
 
05:42:43.110 --> 05:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
think everybody in the surrounding
 
05:42:44.948 --> 05:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
states would want to do that as well so
 
05:42:47.030 --> 05:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
i hope you pass this available for
 
05:42:49.670 --> 05:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
questions um this is kind of my thing
 
05:42:51.190 --> 05:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
and i'll let um
 
05:42:53.270 --> 05:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
let the next person throw some things
 
05:42:53.280 --> 05:42:56.948 align:start position:0%
let the next person throw some things
out

05:42:56.948 --> 05:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:58.948 --> 05:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
uh we do have someone who wants to ask
 
05:43:01.270 --> 05:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
you a question yeah so representative
 
05:43:01.280 --> 05:43:03.990 align:start position:0%
you a question yeah so representative
ham

05:43:03.990 --> 05:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:07.510 --> 05:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you mr chairman
 
05:43:09.990 --> 05:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my questions
 
05:43:13.350 --> 05:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
do you know if there is any requirement
 
05:43:16.708 --> 05:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
for manufacturers of home appliances and
 
05:43:19.030 --> 05:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
i mean major appliances uh not
 
05:43:21.510 --> 05:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily a toaster but
 
05:43:21.520 --> 05:43:22.470 align:start position:0%
necessarily a toaster but
to

05:43:22.470 --> 05:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:43:25.350 --> 05:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
have available parts for a certain
 
05:43:27.350 --> 05:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
number of years
 
05:43:29.670 --> 05:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
five years ten years whatever do you
 
05:43:32.628 --> 05:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
know if there's any requirement because
 
05:43:35.830 --> 05:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
i can give you example um
 
05:43:39.270 --> 05:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
i i purchased an appliance and i called
 
05:43:40.868 --> 05:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
a repair man and
 
05:43:43.510 --> 05:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
they said oh dears too bad you bought
 
05:43:43.520 --> 05:43:45.350 align:start position:0%
they said oh dears too bad you bought
that

05:43:45.350 --> 05:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:43:47.910 --> 05:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
product too bad you bought that one
 
05:43:50.708 --> 05:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
because they they are not good at having
 
05:43:53.350 --> 05:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
any pots available they don't they don't
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
make the parts um
 
05:43:59.590 --> 05:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
enough parts uh to be able to repair um
 
05:44:01.750 --> 05:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
your particular appliance do you know if
 
05:44:03.830 --> 05:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
there's any requirement that they
 
05:44:05.750 --> 05:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
are supposed to
 
05:44:08.390 --> 05:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
make parts available for five years ten
 
05:44:10.868 --> 05:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
years whatever
 
05:44:12.948 --> 05:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
excellent question and to my knowledge
 
05:44:15.510 --> 05:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
there are no requirements um we believe
 
05:44:17.910 --> 05:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
that there's a requirement in europe i
 
05:44:19.910 --> 05:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
think france has some requirements and
 
05:44:22.070 --> 05:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
those are new coming in
 
05:44:25.350 --> 05:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
um and oh yes cal california has a spare
 
05:44:27.510 --> 05:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
parts requirement
 
05:44:27.520 --> 05:44:28.390 align:start position:0%
parts requirement
but

05:44:28.390 --> 05:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:44:30.470 --> 05:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's for five years
 
05:44:32.230 --> 05:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
and since you're in new hampshire not in
 
05:44:33.910 --> 05:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
california you probably have to go see
 
05:44:35.510 --> 05:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
if you could acquire that part in
 
05:44:35.520 --> 05:44:37.990 align:start position:0%
if you could acquire that part in
california

05:44:37.990 --> 05:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
california
 
05:44:40.470 --> 05:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
but nationally there's nothing um and
 
05:44:43.510 --> 05:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
sadly i've been in your shoes i i also
 
05:44:45.750 --> 05:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
have clients
 
05:44:48.390 --> 05:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
where they mysteriously ran out of parts
 
05:44:52.230 --> 05:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:53.910 --> 05:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson has a
 
05:44:53.920 --> 05:44:55.910 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson has a
question

05:44:55.910 --> 05:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:44:57.830 --> 05:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:44:59.750 --> 05:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question isn't one of the
 
05:45:01.830 --> 05:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
arguments for right to repair i i
 
05:45:03.670 --> 05:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
haven't read this i read an article many
 
05:45:04.788 --> 05:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
05:45:06.948 --> 05:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
that it was partly to cut down on
 
05:45:09.750 --> 05:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
landfill use and
 
05:45:11.590 --> 05:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
improve improve
 
05:45:13.510 --> 05:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
improve recycling and reduce the
 
05:45:15.910 --> 05:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
negative environmental impact of uh
 
05:45:18.788 --> 05:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
buying all these manufactured goods
 
05:45:21.670 --> 05:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
um it's a byproduct and a fortunate
 
05:45:23.910 --> 05:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
by-product because if you can keep your
 
05:45:26.230 --> 05:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
things running they don't go into the
 
05:45:29.030 --> 05:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
waste the waste cycle and a lot of the
 
05:45:30.708 --> 05:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
um waste
 
05:45:32.708 --> 05:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
is accelerating
 
05:45:34.548 --> 05:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
because more and more stuff doesn't last
 
05:45:36.150 --> 05:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
as long as it could i mean what are you
 
05:45:38.548 --> 05:45:38.558 align:start position:0%
going to do with it with a refrigerator
 
05:45:41.190 --> 05:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
that you can't fix it's going to go in
 
05:45:44.390 --> 05:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:45.590 --> 05:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
05:45:46.708 --> 05:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:45:48.150 --> 05:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

bill uh
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
they don't have much more other
 
05:46:07.190 --> 05:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
information so tell them can you
 
05:46:08.548 --> 05:46:08.558 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself and what your
 
05:46:10.548 --> 05:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
background is before you
 
05:46:10.558 --> 05:46:11.430 align:start position:0%
background is before you
you

05:46:11.430 --> 05:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:46:13.190 --> 05:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
you have to unmute yourself so there you
 
05:46:13.200 --> 05:46:14.150 align:start position:0%
you have to unmute yourself so there you
go

05:46:14.150 --> 05:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:46:16.628 --> 05:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
perfect all right uh can you hear me now
 
05:46:18.628 --> 05:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
yes we begin
 
05:46:20.470 --> 05:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
05:46:22.548 --> 05:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
i am a barrington resident in new
 
05:46:22.558 --> 05:46:23.750 align:start position:0%
i am a barrington resident in new
hampshire

05:46:23.750 --> 05:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:46:25.510 --> 05:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
i came along i figured uh you should
 
05:46:27.350 --> 05:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
have somebody local
 
05:46:27.360 --> 05:46:29.990 align:start position:0%
have somebody local
um

05:46:29.990 --> 05:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:31.990 --> 05:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
currently my my job title is technically
 
05:46:34.390 --> 05:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh engineering technician
 
05:46:37.430 --> 05:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh i do mostly desk work at this point
 
05:46:40.708 --> 05:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:45.350 --> 05:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:46.470 --> 05:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
no no
 
05:46:47.670 --> 05:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
i actually don't use the phone for
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
hardly anything i i spent a while
 
05:46:52.230 --> 05:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
writing procedures and then i went on to
 
05:46:54.470 --> 05:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know configuration
 
05:46:57.110 --> 05:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
related tasks but
 
05:46:58.868 --> 05:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
so anyway
 
05:47:01.590 --> 05:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
i am in support of this bill um
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
primarily because well i
 
05:47:06.070 --> 05:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
have generally preferred independent
 
05:47:07.590 --> 05:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
repair they haven't they have a tendency
 
05:47:09.590 --> 05:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
to be allowed to do things that
 
05:47:12.310 --> 05:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
your regular authorized repair
 
05:47:15.350 --> 05:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
technician would not be allowed to do
 
05:47:16.548 --> 05:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
like kind of like when you go to an
 
05:47:18.070 --> 05:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
automotive shop
 
05:47:23.430 --> 05:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:24.948 --> 05:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
like you go to your dealer with an
 
05:47:27.430 --> 05:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
exhaust leak and it's going to be 1500
 
05:47:28.548 --> 05:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
because the only thing they'll be
 
05:47:31.590 --> 05:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to do is remove and replace
 
05:47:33.190 --> 05:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
well having
 
05:47:33.200 --> 05:47:34.230 align:start position:0%
well having
having

05:47:34.230 --> 05:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
having
 
05:47:36.390 --> 05:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
the authorized repair they have a
 
05:47:38.708 --> 05:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
tendency to be less bound by the rules
 
05:47:40.230 --> 05:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
and if parts aren't available they can
 
05:47:41.190 --> 05:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
do more
 
05:47:43.110 --> 05:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
but this just sort of brings it together
 
05:47:46.310 --> 05:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
so they can still actually do
 
05:47:51.430 --> 05:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:53.910 --> 05:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
05:47:56.070 --> 05:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
well most of my concerns have already
 
05:47:58.788 --> 05:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
been covered by the previous speaker
 
05:47:58.798 --> 05:48:01.990 align:start position:0%
been covered by the previous speaker
and

05:48:01.990 --> 05:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:03.430 --> 05:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
um let's see
 
05:48:04.708 --> 05:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
well that's good
 
05:48:07.350 --> 05:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
we're glad you called in and
 
05:48:11.350 --> 05:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
you're looking at your notes or i i am
 
05:48:11.360 --> 05:48:12.788 align:start position:0%
you're looking at your notes or i i am
most

05:48:12.788 --> 05:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
most
 
05:48:12.798 --> 05:48:15.110 align:start position:0%
most
um

05:48:15.110 --> 05:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:15.120 --> 05:48:17.270 align:start position:0%
um
that's

05:48:17.270 --> 05:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:48:18.788 --> 05:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
all right well that's great well thank
 
05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
you very much for calling and we
 
05:48:22.628 --> 05:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate in and hearing hearing from
 
05:48:24.948 --> 05:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
05:48:26.948 --> 05:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
oh one more thing if uh
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
if i'm not unmuted um
 
05:48:31.110 --> 05:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
as far as the scope issue that we had
 
05:48:33.110 --> 05:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
before with the previous bill
 
05:48:34.868 --> 05:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
uh would it be would you consider it
 
05:48:37.270 --> 05:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to expand that but i'll
 
05:48:39.510 --> 05:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
make that a voluntary thing kind of like
 
05:48:41.190 --> 05:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
how um
 
05:48:43.430 --> 05:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
just like a mandatory disclosure or if
 
05:48:44.788 --> 05:48:44.798 align:start position:0%
this doesn't pass to do the same thing
 
05:48:46.230 --> 05:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
but as a voluntary but you have to
 
05:48:48.868 --> 05:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
disclose that it's not falling within
 
05:48:51.350 --> 05:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
a fair repair guideline
 
05:48:53.670 --> 05:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
because as a consumer i'm trying to
 
05:48:53.680 --> 05:48:54.708 align:start position:0%
because as a consumer i'm trying to
navigate

05:48:54.708 --> 05:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
navigate
 
05:48:57.910 --> 05:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
um which products to buy and
 
05:48:59.750 --> 05:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
usually for the most part people don't
 
05:49:01.670 --> 05:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
know what they can repair until it
 
05:49:01.680 --> 05:49:03.910 align:start position:0%
know what they can repair until it
breaks

05:49:03.910 --> 05:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
breaks
 
05:49:05.910 --> 05:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
so if there is some sort of something
 
05:49:05.920 --> 05:49:08.868 align:start position:0%
so if there is some sort of something
that

05:49:08.868 --> 05:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:10.628 --> 05:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
i guess kind of like when obama came out
 
05:49:12.470 --> 05:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
though the best thing about obamacare
 
05:49:13.990 --> 05:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
was that
 
05:49:15.350 --> 05:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not you liked
 
05:49:17.590 --> 05:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
the bill or not at least defined basic
 
05:49:18.948 --> 05:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
essential coverage so you knew what you
 
05:49:21.430 --> 05:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
were getting when you bought it
 
05:49:23.830 --> 05:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
just having a definition that you know
 
05:49:26.070 --> 05:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
that they have to disclose hey this you
 
05:49:26.080 --> 05:49:27.590 align:start position:0%
that they have to disclose hey this you
can't

05:49:27.590 --> 05:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
can't
 
05:49:29.510 --> 05:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
they put it so they can't put berries
 
05:49:31.590 --> 05:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
and obstacles into repair
 
05:49:31.600 --> 05:49:32.948 align:start position:0%
and obstacles into repair
but

05:49:32.948 --> 05:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:49:34.470 --> 05:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
you know without us knowing about it
 
05:49:37.190 --> 05:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
until it breaks
 
05:49:40.230 --> 05:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting concept
 
05:49:41.830 --> 05:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much thank
 
05:49:43.670 --> 05:49:43.680 align:start position:0%

05:50:25.590 --> 05:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
area that's all sorry
 
05:50:27.270 --> 05:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
i think the next person is also a dc
 
05:50:28.948 --> 05:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
lobbyist so this is good to have you
 
05:50:31.110 --> 05:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
guys next to each other go ahead
 
05:50:33.430 --> 05:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
um ahem believes this bill raises far
 
05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
more issues and concerns it seeks to
 
05:50:35.520 --> 05:50:36.868 align:start position:0%
more issues and concerns it seeks to
address

05:50:36.868 --> 05:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:50:38.390 --> 05:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
our industry encompasses everything from
 
05:50:40.150 --> 05:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
your refrigerator your clothes washer
 
05:50:42.390 --> 05:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
microwave electric toothbrush
 
05:50:44.470 --> 05:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
with that repairs come with the handling
 
05:50:46.230 --> 05:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
of refrigerant gases
 
05:50:48.310 --> 05:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
wiring electrical connections
 
05:50:50.070 --> 05:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
in fact appliances are subject to
 
05:50:52.628 --> 05:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
electrical codes building codes plumbing
 
05:50:55.110 --> 05:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
codes safety standards as well as
 
05:50:57.270 --> 05:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
state requirements to handle gas and
 
05:50:58.948 --> 05:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
electricity to ensure our products are
 
05:51:01.350 --> 05:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
handled safely there is wires paramount
 
05:51:02.230 --> 05:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
we have an authorized repair
 
05:51:04.390 --> 05:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
professional who is trained to properly
 
05:51:05.830 --> 05:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
handle our products
 
05:51:08.310 --> 05:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
to ensure the customer remains safe
 
05:51:10.310 --> 05:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
opening up the repair process to anyone
 
05:51:12.230 --> 05:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
could have a significant impact the
 
05:51:13.670 --> 05:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
safety and the reliability of the
 
05:51:15.910 --> 05:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
product improper repairs could lead to
 
05:51:18.310 --> 05:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
significant property damage
 
05:51:19.750 --> 05:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
it could also lead to the opening up of
 
05:51:21.830 --> 05:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
the connected features of the products
 
05:51:23.110 --> 05:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
opening up
 
05:51:26.548 --> 05:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
exposure to plus or data of the consumer
 
05:51:28.708 --> 05:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturers will no longer know how
 
05:51:29.830 --> 05:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
will no longer have the ability to
 
05:51:31.190 --> 05:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
properly assess
 
05:51:33.670 --> 05:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
whether the people entering their homes
 
05:51:35.670 --> 05:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
not the necessary technical safety
 
05:51:36.948 --> 05:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
insurance checks make sure the customer
 
05:51:38.390 --> 05:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
remains safe
 
05:51:40.150 --> 05:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
i do want to mention that any repair
 
05:51:42.310 --> 05:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
provider can conduct appliance repairs
 
05:51:44.868 --> 05:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
if they if the if the repair providers
 
05:51:46.230 --> 05:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
seek the proper certification and
 
05:51:48.230 --> 05:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
training set forth by the appliance
 
05:51:48.240 --> 05:51:49.590 align:start position:0%
training set forth by the appliance
manufacturer

05:51:49.590 --> 05:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
05:51:51.270 --> 05:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
in fact there's currently a nationwide
 
05:51:53.350 --> 05:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
home appliance service repair network
 
05:51:54.948 --> 05:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
that includes about 20 000 service
 
05:51:57.670 --> 05:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
repair shops of that 88 of those are
 
05:52:00.788 --> 05:52:00.798 align:start position:0%
independent uh manufacture affiliated
 
05:52:03.910 --> 05:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
so to conclude appliances are complex
 
05:52:05.590 --> 05:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
products they require training and
 
05:52:05.600 --> 05:52:07.110 align:start position:0%
products they require training and
accountability

05:52:07.110 --> 05:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
05:52:09.030 --> 05:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
untrained repairs can can come from our
 
05:52:11.430 --> 05:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
safety and security with that i strongly
 
05:52:13.750 --> 05:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
urge you to oppose house bill 449 i'm
 
05:52:17.430 --> 05:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:20.390 --> 05:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh okay any questions from the committee
 
05:52:20.400 --> 05:52:22.150 align:start position:0%
uh okay any questions from the committee
members

05:52:22.150 --> 05:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
members
 
05:52:23.670 --> 05:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh we do have some questions
 
05:52:25.830 --> 05:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
05:52:28.310 --> 05:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chairman now you can
 
05:52:30.788 --> 05:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
you testify now i'll let you go oh
 
05:52:32.150 --> 05:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah
 
05:52:33.350 --> 05:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:52:36.548 --> 05:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
but i'll let you go no it's all right
 
05:52:38.948 --> 05:52:38.958 align:start position:0%
um you say that it's a safety issue
 
05:52:40.390 --> 05:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
please tell me how
 
05:52:43.270 --> 05:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
um somebody repairs a washing machine
 
05:52:43.280 --> 05:52:44.310 align:start position:0%
um somebody repairs a washing machine
and

05:52:44.310 --> 05:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:52:45.990 --> 05:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
05:52:46.000 --> 05:52:47.190 align:start position:0%
um it's
not

05:52:47.190 --> 05:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:52:50.070 --> 05:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
under the purview of the manufacturer's
 
05:52:52.628 --> 05:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
um representative um what the safety
 
05:52:54.070 --> 05:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
issue would be
 
05:52:56.788 --> 05:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
so i'll give you an example so um i i
 
05:52:58.628 --> 05:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
had this issue a couple weeks ago so my
 
05:52:58.638 --> 05:52:59.670 align:start position:0%
had this issue a couple weeks ago so my
washer

05:52:59.670 --> 05:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
washer
 
05:53:02.310 --> 05:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
had a lid switch issue what that means
 
05:53:04.868 --> 05:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
is if the door is unlocked the washer
 
05:53:04.878 --> 05:53:06.230 align:start position:0%
is if the door is unlocked the washer
continues

05:53:06.230 --> 05:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
continues
 
05:53:08.470 --> 05:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
so it's a big issue if you obviously
 
05:53:10.310 --> 05:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
have any people who can put their hands
 
05:53:11.350 --> 05:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
into it
 
05:53:14.470 --> 05:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
um i called someone in and that they
 
05:53:15.910 --> 05:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
fixed it
 
05:53:17.590 --> 05:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
but with if you have your refrigerants
 
05:53:19.270 --> 05:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
you have your
 
05:53:22.788 --> 05:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
ranch hoods that require gas um so
 
05:53:24.868 --> 05:53:24.878 align:start position:0%
every major appliance has
 
05:53:26.788 --> 05:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
um you know gas electric wiring that
 
05:53:26.798 --> 05:53:28.150 align:start position:0%
um you know gas electric wiring that
require

05:53:28.150 --> 05:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
require
 
05:53:30.150 --> 05:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
federal and state requirements and
 
05:53:33.990 --> 05:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
certification just to handle so
 
05:53:35.430 --> 05:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
ask another question
 
05:53:37.430 --> 05:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
further question you may inquire thank
 
05:53:38.788 --> 05:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
you um
 
05:53:40.310 --> 05:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
of course these are you know these are
 
05:53:41.910 --> 05:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
ordinary kinds of things that would go
 
05:53:45.510 --> 05:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
with any appliance um it i can't imagine
 
05:53:47.750 --> 05:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
that a repair person
 
05:53:50.070 --> 05:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't be able to fix the
 
05:53:51.910 --> 05:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
the lead uh
 
05:53:54.470 --> 05:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
lock or even the refrigerant in a
 
05:53:55.830 --> 05:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
refrigerator i mean you're still talking
 
05:53:55.840 --> 05:53:56.548 align:start position:0%
refrigerator i mean you're still talking
about

05:53:56.548 --> 05:53:56.558 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:53:59.270 --> 05:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
being able to um
 
05:54:02.708 --> 05:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
call a competent and repair man and
 
05:54:04.788 --> 05:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
for the manufacturers to keep this out
 
05:54:06.230 --> 05:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
why i mean
 
05:54:08.868 --> 05:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
what is it that was that's a a secret
 
05:54:11.190 --> 05:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
that nobody can know about to be able to
 
05:54:11.200 --> 05:54:12.310 align:start position:0%
that nobody can know about to be able to
repair

05:54:12.310 --> 05:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
repair
 
05:54:14.708 --> 05:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
uh washing machine properly
 
05:54:16.948 --> 05:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
well i would say it's the the model i
 
05:54:19.110 --> 05:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
mean our repaired
 
05:54:21.430 --> 05:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
our authorized repairmen are trained on
 
05:54:23.830 --> 05:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
the model they train on state code
 
05:54:25.750 --> 05:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
they're training how to handle
 
05:54:27.190 --> 05:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
every model that they've been trained
 
05:54:29.270 --> 05:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
for so
 
05:54:29.280 --> 05:54:30.470 align:start position:0%
for so
there's

05:54:30.470 --> 05:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:54:31.510 --> 05:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
i mean and
 
05:54:31.520 --> 05:54:32.628 align:start position:0%
i mean and
and

05:54:32.628 --> 05:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:54:34.548 --> 05:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
there is independent market you can
 
05:54:36.708 --> 05:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
become an authorized repairman
 
05:54:38.948 --> 05:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
and not be affiliated you know with
 
05:54:40.868 --> 05:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
a manufacturer you can become and you
 
05:54:42.470 --> 05:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
can become trained
 
05:54:43.910 --> 05:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the secrets if you want to you want
 
05:54:45.750 --> 05:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
them you can work to get them through
 
05:54:47.430 --> 05:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
the training process
 
05:54:49.510 --> 05:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
may ask a question
 
05:54:54.070 --> 05:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes can you tell us how um some
 
05:54:56.390 --> 05:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
independent repairmen can become
 
05:54:59.270 --> 05:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
trained yeah so it's it's two layers so
 
05:55:00.628 --> 05:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
first you gotta meet all the state
 
05:55:02.150 --> 05:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
requirements the federal requirements to
 
05:55:02.160 --> 05:55:03.270 align:start position:0%
requirements the federal requirements to
handle

05:55:03.270 --> 05:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
handle
 
05:55:05.110 --> 05:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
gas electricity
 
05:55:06.470 --> 05:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh wiring
 
05:55:08.708 --> 05:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
and then um the second layer is the
 
05:55:08.718 --> 05:55:10.310 align:start position:0%
and then um the second layer is the
manufactural

05:55:10.310 --> 05:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
manufactural
 
05:55:11.670 --> 05:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
you know whole it's
 
05:55:14.070 --> 05:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
obviously manufactured specific
 
05:55:16.470 --> 05:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
but they'll hold you know trainings on
 
05:55:17.670 --> 05:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
their models
 
05:55:19.190 --> 05:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
05:55:21.190 --> 05:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
you might have a repair
 
05:55:23.190 --> 05:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
individual in new hampshire
 
05:55:26.070 --> 05:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
that he he just focuses on one or two
 
05:55:29.350 --> 05:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturers so those manufacturers
 
05:55:31.430 --> 05:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
will hold trainings
 
05:55:32.788 --> 05:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
each each manufacturer has different
 
05:55:34.390 --> 05:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
training uh but
 
05:55:34.400 --> 05:55:35.430 align:start position:0%
training uh but
it's

05:55:35.430 --> 05:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:55:37.590 --> 05:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
and it's manufacturers they'll offer the
 
05:55:37.600 --> 05:55:39.910 align:start position:0%
and it's manufacturers they'll offer the
training

05:55:39.910 --> 05:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:42.548 --> 05:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
yeah and the reality is is that
 
05:55:44.548 --> 05:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
in general the authorized service
 
05:55:46.310 --> 05:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
technicians are people who are
 
05:55:49.430 --> 05:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
affiliated with organizations that sell
 
05:55:51.750 --> 05:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
that equipment so that
 
05:55:54.868 --> 05:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
if you were a you know a fancy dancing
 
05:55:58.788 --> 05:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
sub-zero refrigerator and in the place
 
05:56:00.310 --> 05:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
where you would buy the sub-zero they
 
05:56:01.670 --> 05:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
would have the
 
05:56:03.990 --> 05:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:56:06.390 --> 05:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
train fully trained technician so
 
05:56:08.310 --> 05:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily a third party and
 
05:56:09.830 --> 05:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's really what this bill is about is
 
05:56:11.670 --> 05:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
about third party
 
05:56:15.270 --> 05:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative terry has a question
 
05:56:17.510 --> 05:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
oops yes thank you mr chairman um mr
 
05:56:20.070 --> 05:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
keane i'm trying to understand your uh
 
05:56:23.030 --> 05:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
your uh testimony as uh completely and
 
05:56:25.750 --> 05:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
as fairly as possible
 
05:56:28.868 --> 05:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
is it the position of your group that
 
05:56:28.878 --> 05:56:30.310 align:start position:0%
is it the position of your group that
consumers

05:56:30.310 --> 05:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
05:56:31.990 --> 05:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
should not be in the business
 
05:56:34.390 --> 05:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote of repairing
 
05:56:36.470 --> 05:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
your own appliances
 
05:56:38.150 --> 05:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to give you two specific
 
05:56:39.430 --> 05:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
examples and
 
05:56:40.548 --> 05:56:40.558 align:start position:0%
have you
 
05:56:43.110 --> 05:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
have you speak to them
 
05:56:45.110 --> 05:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
the upper thermostat on my electric hot
 
05:56:46.830 --> 05:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
water failed just
 
05:56:49.830 --> 05:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
recently i ordered the part
 
05:56:52.548 --> 05:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
followed the instructions and fixed
 
05:56:56.708 --> 05:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
the unit in about 15 to 20 minutes
 
05:56:59.270 --> 05:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
similarly i had a problem with my
 
05:57:01.670 --> 05:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
dishwasher a few years ago the printed
 
05:57:03.510 --> 05:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
circuit board
 
05:57:06.548 --> 05:57:06.558 align:start position:0%
that controls the dishwasher was faulty
 
05:57:07.750 --> 05:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
i ordered
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
the part from a third party
 
05:57:12.628 --> 05:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
and followed the instructions and i
 
05:57:15.030 --> 05:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
completed the repair myself
 
05:57:16.788 --> 05:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
do you have an opinion about that would
 
05:57:19.590 --> 05:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
you prefer that i not do that
 
05:57:22.310 --> 05:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
and uh called in an authorized service
 
05:57:22.320 --> 05:57:23.350 align:start position:0%
and uh called in an authorized service
dealer

05:57:23.350 --> 05:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
dealer
 
05:57:27.030 --> 05:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
or was it okay that i did what i did
 
05:57:30.470 --> 05:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
some appliance repairs can be done by
 
05:57:32.070 --> 05:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
you know consumers
 
05:57:34.310 --> 05:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's those repairs that
 
05:57:34.320 --> 05:57:35.670 align:start position:0%
it's it's those repairs that
involve

05:57:35.670 --> 05:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
involve
 
05:57:36.948 --> 05:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:57:36.958 --> 05:57:38.470 align:start position:0%
you know
radiation

05:57:38.470 --> 05:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
05:57:41.110 --> 05:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
gas electricity you know i think it's
 
05:57:44.628 --> 05:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
they require certifications to handle um
 
05:57:44.638 --> 05:57:45.350 align:start position:0%
they require certifications to handle um
so

05:57:45.350 --> 05:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:57:47.590 --> 05:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
i i've done repairs i'm not an engineer
 
05:57:49.990 --> 05:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
but i've done repairs myself so
 
05:57:51.830 --> 05:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
um but
 
05:57:54.070 --> 05:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
in many manufactures because of you know
 
05:57:56.230 --> 05:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
the high demand for repairs
 
05:57:59.190 --> 05:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
they want people um they'll they'll help
 
05:58:01.190 --> 05:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
you do them um doesn't have to come to
 
05:58:04.070 --> 05:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:07.350 --> 05:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative abramson has a question
 
05:58:09.510 --> 05:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr keen
 
05:58:09.520 --> 05:58:10.948 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr keen
for

05:58:10.948 --> 05:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:58:10.958 --> 05:58:12.390 align:start position:0%
for
sorry

05:58:12.390 --> 05:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:58:15.270 --> 05:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh my my question
 
05:58:15.280 --> 05:58:16.310 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh my my question
is

05:58:16.310 --> 05:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:58:19.110 --> 05:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
um if i own a refrigerator whether it's
 
05:58:21.430 --> 05:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
10 years old or 20 years old or any
 
05:58:23.830 --> 05:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
other appliance isn't it isn't it mine
 
05:58:25.350 --> 05:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
to repair if i want to take it to an
 
05:58:27.910 --> 05:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
independent repair shop or if i if i
 
05:58:30.628 --> 05:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
know someone who does repairs
 
05:58:32.310 --> 05:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
why is it uh
 
05:58:34.310 --> 05:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
why should the the manufacturer have the
 
05:58:36.230 --> 05:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
ability to prevent me from repairing
 
05:58:38.548 --> 05:58:38.558 align:start position:0%
something that belongs to me
 
05:58:40.628 --> 05:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer is not preventing there
 
05:58:42.548 --> 05:58:42.558 align:start position:0%
there are authorized independent repair
 
05:58:45.510 --> 05:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
people who can fix your refrigerator
 
05:58:45.520 --> 05:58:46.390 align:start position:0%
people who can fix your refrigerator
um

05:58:46.390 --> 05:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:48.070 --> 05:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
it is our belief that
 
05:58:49.430 --> 05:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure the refrigerator
 
05:58:51.590 --> 05:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
lives its full life cycle it should be
 
05:58:54.310 --> 05:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
fixed with it with products that would
 
05:58:55.510 --> 05:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that it
 
05:58:57.510 --> 05:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
lives its full life cycle we don't want
 
05:58:59.110 --> 05:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
things in the refrigerator that are not
 
05:59:01.830 --> 05:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
meant for that refrigerator
 
05:59:04.948 --> 05:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:11.270 --> 05:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:13.750 --> 05:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman huh
 
05:59:16.390 --> 05:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr king for answering my
 
05:59:19.350 --> 05:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
question mine is
 
05:59:21.190 --> 05:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
in the association that you're a member
 
05:59:23.030 --> 05:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
of or represent
 
05:59:25.750 --> 05:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
of men original equipment manufacturers
 
05:59:28.708 --> 05:59:28.718 align:start position:0%
i guess that's what they are basically
 
05:59:31.110 --> 05:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
is there a commitment to
 
05:59:33.350 --> 05:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
have the
 
05:59:33.360 --> 05:59:34.628 align:start position:0%
have the
parts

05:59:34.628 --> 05:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
parts
 
05:59:37.270 --> 05:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
available for a certain period of time
 
05:59:38.948 --> 05:59:38.958 align:start position:0%
so in other words if the
 
05:59:40.628 --> 05:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
if the um
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
expected life expectancy of a
 
05:59:45.750 --> 05:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
a refrigerator or something like that is
 
05:59:48.548 --> 05:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:50.708 --> 05:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
is there a commitment by the members of
 
05:59:53.030 --> 05:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
your organization to
 
05:59:54.628 --> 05:59:54.638 align:start position:0%
have available
 
05:59:54.638 --> 05:59:55.990 align:start position:0%
have available
uh

05:59:55.990 --> 05:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:59:58.150 --> 05:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
parts that would uh
 
06:00:01.910 --> 06:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
be easily available to repair for repair
 
06:00:03.510 --> 06:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
i mean there is no
 
06:00:05.110 --> 06:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
formal commitment
 
06:00:07.270 --> 06:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's between manufacturers
 
06:00:07.280 --> 06:00:08.070 align:start position:0%
that's between manufacturers
but

06:00:08.070 --> 06:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:00:10.548 --> 06:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
they do their best to make sure that all
 
06:00:12.150 --> 06:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
the appliances on the market have the
 
06:00:14.628 --> 06:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
repair parts that they can be fixed with
 
06:00:16.070 --> 06:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:00:17.910 --> 06:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
but i mean there is no formal commitment
 
06:00:19.350 --> 06:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
but they do their best to make sure that
 
06:00:21.510 --> 06:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
their parts are available to fix the
 
06:00:23.350 --> 06:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
refrigerator or any appliance in the
 
06:00:23.360 --> 06:00:24.628 align:start position:0%
refrigerator or any appliance in the
market

06:00:24.628 --> 06:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
market
 
06:00:26.548 --> 06:00:26.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:00:26.558 --> 06:00:27.350 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

06:00:27.350 --> 06:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:00:28.868 --> 06:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
we just had a new question
 
06:00:31.350 --> 06:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
representative has a question for you
 
06:00:33.030 --> 06:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:00:35.990 --> 06:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh before i ask the
 
06:00:37.830 --> 06:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
question would you be willing to submit
 
06:00:40.070 --> 06:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
the testimony that you read uh through
 
06:00:40.080 --> 06:00:40.788 align:start position:0%
the testimony that you read uh through
the

06:00:40.788 --> 06:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:00:42.470 --> 06:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
committee yeah yeah
 
06:00:45.190 --> 06:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
yeah no problem yeah all right
 
06:00:48.070 --> 06:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion earlier about
 
06:00:48.080 --> 06:00:51.510 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion earlier about
diagnostics

06:00:51.510 --> 06:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:53.190 --> 06:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
that you know you plug in a piece of
 
06:00:55.270 --> 06:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
diagnostic equipment and there's an
 
06:00:58.070 --> 06:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
error code that displays
 
06:00:59.430 --> 06:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
06:00:59.440 --> 06:01:01.750 align:start position:0%
and the
manufacturer

06:01:01.750 --> 06:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
06:01:04.310 --> 06:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh has control of what those error codes
 
06:01:07.270 --> 06:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
mean right they're designed to have
 
06:01:07.280 --> 06:01:08.230 align:start position:0%
mean right they're designed to have
the

06:01:08.230 --> 06:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:01:09.910 --> 06:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
they're designed to speed up the
 
06:01:12.150 --> 06:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of the problem
 
06:01:13.430 --> 06:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
but there's also
 
06:01:17.190 --> 06:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
a an opportunity to kind of obfuscate
 
06:01:19.430 --> 06:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
those codes um
 
06:01:21.510 --> 06:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know not not make them publicly
 
06:01:21.520 --> 06:01:22.868 align:start position:0%
you know not not make them publicly
available

06:01:22.868 --> 06:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
available
 
06:01:25.190 --> 06:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
so that only a certain number of people
 
06:01:26.390 --> 06:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
know what those
 
06:01:28.390 --> 06:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
special codes mean
 
06:01:29.670 --> 06:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
06:01:34.070 --> 06:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:36.150 --> 06:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
to make those codes and those that
 
06:01:38.390 --> 06:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
diagnostic equipment publicly available
 
06:01:40.150 --> 06:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
so at least
 
06:01:42.070 --> 06:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
some people aren't at a disadvantage in
 
06:01:44.788 --> 06:01:44.798 align:start position:0%
diagnosing a problem
 
06:01:44.798 --> 06:01:45.830 align:start position:0%
diagnosing a problem
so

06:01:45.830 --> 06:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:01:48.948 --> 06:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
i cannot commit to that um and i think i
 
06:01:49.910 --> 06:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
want to
 
06:01:51.430 --> 06:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
articulate that
 
06:01:53.750 --> 06:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know the reason diagnostic tools are
 
06:01:56.230 --> 06:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
there is it make sure we have our
 
06:01:57.430 --> 06:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
professionals who can handle those
 
06:01:59.750 --> 06:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
diagnostics as they are
 
06:02:01.110 --> 06:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
one thing to keep in mind for our
 
06:02:02.470 --> 06:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
appliances is
 
06:02:04.470 --> 06:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
with the smart appliances
 
06:02:06.230 --> 06:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're all connected you know we want
 
06:02:08.310 --> 06:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure people who are trained who
 
06:02:10.390 --> 06:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
know where to handle those appliances
 
06:02:12.230 --> 06:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
and we don't want people who can
 
06:02:16.548 --> 06:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
access them freely um so i think it's
 
06:02:18.390 --> 06:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
it's there's tools there that allow
 
06:02:19.750 --> 06:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
people who are trained to handle those
 
06:02:19.760 --> 06:02:21.430 align:start position:0%
people who are trained to handle those
appliances

06:02:21.430 --> 06:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
appliances
 
06:02:23.350 --> 06:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up question mr true what is
 
06:02:25.590 --> 06:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
the question you may inquire
 
06:02:28.628 --> 06:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
there's a relatively new um
 
06:02:30.150 --> 06:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
thing happening
 
06:02:31.750 --> 06:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
with repair and it was it was referred
 
06:02:33.670 --> 06:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
to earlier in one of our first
 
06:02:36.708 --> 06:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
testimonies and that is
 
06:02:38.628 --> 06:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of not just appliances but
 
06:02:40.470 --> 06:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
also cell phones and tablets and
 
06:02:40.480 --> 06:02:41.270 align:start position:0%
also cell phones and tablets and
different

06:02:41.270 --> 06:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:02:43.990 --> 06:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
types of equipment electronic equipment
 
06:02:47.750 --> 06:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer is password protecting
 
06:02:50.390 --> 06:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
the replacement of a component
 
06:02:52.070 --> 06:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
and we heard that referenced uh earlier
 
06:02:54.310 --> 06:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
i think it was a refrigerator so
 
06:02:56.548 --> 06:02:56.558 align:start position:0%
you can die let's say you get you figure
 
06:02:59.350 --> 06:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
out what the magic trouble code means
 
06:03:01.750 --> 06:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
you get your hands on a
 
06:03:01.760 --> 06:03:02.868 align:start position:0%
you get your hands on a
like

06:03:02.868 --> 06:03:02.878 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:03:06.548 --> 06:03:06.558 align:start position:0%
uh like an identical part to replace
 
06:03:08.470 --> 06:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
but in order to install that part you
 
06:03:09.990 --> 06:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
need a password
 
06:03:11.750 --> 06:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
to install that part
 
06:03:13.590 --> 06:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
what's the purpose of
 
06:03:16.070 --> 06:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
password protecting
 
06:03:18.150 --> 06:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
identical components
 
06:03:20.390 --> 06:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
so that the manufacturer keeps control
 
06:03:20.400 --> 06:03:22.070 align:start position:0%
so that the manufacturer keeps control
over

06:03:22.070 --> 06:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
over
 
06:03:24.470 --> 06:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh even who can install an identical
 
06:03:26.310 --> 06:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
part why would you do that
 
06:03:26.320 --> 06:03:27.270 align:start position:0%
part why would you do that
well

06:03:27.270 --> 06:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:03:31.270 --> 06:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
for personal protection um you know with
 
06:03:34.708 --> 06:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
what this build does is it opens up your
 
06:03:36.310 --> 06:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
home network to anyone who can come into
 
06:03:38.788 --> 06:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
your house you know our industry is
 
06:03:40.310 --> 06:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
unique that people can walk into your
 
06:03:40.320 --> 06:03:41.510 align:start position:0%
unique that people can walk into your
house

06:03:41.510 --> 06:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
house
 
06:03:41.520 --> 06:03:42.708 align:start position:0%
house
and

06:03:42.708 --> 06:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:44.470 --> 06:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
they repair your products
 
06:03:46.948 --> 06:03:46.958 align:start position:0%
having a password protection makes it so
 
06:03:49.190 --> 06:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's just you and the people who know
 
06:03:52.310 --> 06:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
the products can handle your products
 
06:03:52.320 --> 06:03:56.548 align:start position:0%
the products can handle your products
so

06:03:56.548 --> 06:03:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:56.558 --> 06:03:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:03:57.830 --> 06:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:03:59.510 --> 06:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh well thank you very much for your
 
06:04:01.430 --> 06:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
testimony uh
 
06:04:03.270 --> 06:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
i only have one more person and about
 
06:04:05.830 --> 06:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes i'll more might pop up but
 
06:04:07.350 --> 06:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
nathan proctor
 
06:04:10.310 --> 06:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
who represents uh us perg and i know
 
06:04:11.990 --> 06:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
what that is public interest research
 
06:04:12.000 --> 06:04:13.430 align:start position:0%
what that is public interest research
group

06:04:13.430 --> 06:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
group
 
06:04:15.270 --> 06:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
and uh it does say you're a lobbyist are
 
06:04:17.190 --> 06:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
you from uh washington or are you from
 
06:04:18.070 --> 06:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it looks like you have a
 
06:04:19.990 --> 06:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
wood stove in the back i you know i'm in
 
06:04:22.150 --> 06:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
arlington i was cut you made a comment
 
06:04:23.910 --> 06:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
that i was from dc and i was a little
 
06:04:26.390 --> 06:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
bit insulted earlier chair hunt
 
06:04:28.150 --> 06:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
um no i'm i'm here in arlington

massachusetts um it's so good to be in
france

06:04:30.708 --> 06:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
france
 
06:04:32.390 --> 06:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
and i was thinking oh yes no no
 
06:04:34.070 --> 06:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
arlington massachusetts i said what is
 
06:04:35.430 --> 06:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
he offended by you know are they just
 
06:04:37.750 --> 06:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
right next to dc okay that's it for the
 
06:04:40.948 --> 06:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
second yeah yes no um yeah
 
06:04:43.510 --> 06:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
so anyway so happy to be here um
 
06:04:45.030 --> 06:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
as chair hunts at the u.s public
 
06:04:46.628 --> 06:04:46.638 align:start position:0%
interest research group we're a consumer
 
06:04:48.628 --> 06:04:48.638 align:start position:0%
advocacy group with state affiliates all
 
06:04:49.990 --> 06:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
over the country including new hampshire
 
06:04:52.470 --> 06:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
perg and and so you know some of this
 
06:04:53.590 --> 06:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
some of the things i was going to say
 
06:04:55.110 --> 06:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
are covered so i'm going to just kind of
 
06:04:56.948 --> 06:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
make a couple points
 
06:04:59.990 --> 06:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
um you know the first is like i believe
 
06:05:02.150 --> 06:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
people are capable and smart
 
06:05:04.230 --> 06:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
this is my world view
 
06:05:07.910 --> 06:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
i don't imagine a world in which we need
 
06:05:09.990 --> 06:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of our appliances to
 
06:05:12.390 --> 06:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
decide what we should be able to do with
 
06:05:14.390 --> 06:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
them that what we can fix and what we
 
06:05:17.030 --> 06:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
can't fix like people are resourceful if
 
06:05:19.430 --> 06:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
you give them the parts and information
 
06:05:21.430 --> 06:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
they'll probably do
 
06:05:23.670 --> 06:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
more and it's their stuff so they take
 
06:05:23.680 --> 06:05:25.030 align:start position:0%
more and it's their stuff so they take
responsibility

06:05:25.030 --> 06:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
06:05:26.788 --> 06:05:26.798 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's and i think that they
 
06:05:28.708 --> 06:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
can do it i don't believe that we need
 
06:05:30.788 --> 06:05:30.798 align:start position:0%
companies to dictate who who is
 
06:05:32.708 --> 06:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
qualified or smart enough to do basic
 
06:05:34.788 --> 06:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
maintenance of appliances
 
06:05:34.798 --> 06:05:35.830 align:start position:0%
maintenance of appliances
um

06:05:35.830 --> 06:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:37.510 --> 06:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
i i did want to say you know we've had
 
06:05:40.150 --> 06:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
these products in our homes for 70 years
 
06:05:42.070 --> 06:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
there's a billion or so appliances out
 
06:05:43.990 --> 06:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
in america in the wild living in
 
06:05:46.470 --> 06:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
people's houses if there was some safety
 
06:05:46.480 --> 06:05:47.350 align:start position:0%
people's houses if there was some safety
issue

06:05:47.350 --> 06:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:05:49.990 --> 06:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
that was a real thing
 
06:05:51.670 --> 06:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
introduced by independent repair or
 
06:05:51.680 --> 06:05:53.030 align:start position:0%
introduced by independent repair or
self-repair

06:05:53.030 --> 06:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
self-repair
 
06:05:54.868 --> 06:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
there would be some data to back up that
 
06:05:56.948 --> 06:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
assertion but because there isn't you
 
06:05:58.628 --> 06:05:58.638 align:start position:0%
know i think that we have enough data to
 
06:06:00.948 --> 06:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
say yeah that's because
 
06:06:02.868 --> 06:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
you know people can manage the risk of
 
06:06:04.230 --> 06:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
an appliance
 
06:06:05.910 --> 06:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know repair without causing
 
06:06:08.868 --> 06:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
themselves too many problems uh and and
 
06:06:10.470 --> 06:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
then i i also wanted to talk a little
 
06:06:12.390 --> 06:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
bit about
 
06:06:13.990 --> 06:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
just exactly what's happening in this
 
06:06:16.310 --> 06:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
industry and kind of to de-obfuscate
 
06:06:17.990 --> 06:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
some of the you know certified
 
06:06:18.000 --> 06:06:19.190 align:start position:0%
some of the you know certified
authorized

06:06:19.190 --> 06:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
06:06:20.830 --> 06:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
um questions
 
06:06:20.840 --> 06:06:22.470 align:start position:0%
um questions
so

06:06:22.470 --> 06:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:06:24.868 --> 06:06:24.878 align:start position:0%
when you become authorized it's not
 
06:06:27.270 --> 06:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
because you are credentialed and trained
 
06:06:29.110 --> 06:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
i mean that might be part of the process
 
06:06:30.708 --> 06:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
but you've signed
 
06:06:32.310 --> 06:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
a contract
 
06:06:34.230 --> 06:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
with the manufacturer
 
06:06:36.310 --> 06:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
which gives them significant power over
 
06:06:38.708 --> 06:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
what you do with their equipment um some
 
06:06:41.110 --> 06:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
of these like contracts i've i've seen
 
06:06:44.150 --> 06:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
they're 40 plus pages long for appliance
 
06:06:46.470 --> 06:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
you know authorized technicians they
 
06:06:48.230 --> 06:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
what kind of uniforms you have to wear
 
06:06:50.070 --> 06:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
what kind of trucks you have to drive
 
06:06:52.070 --> 06:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of technicians who
 
06:06:55.910 --> 06:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
do not want to sign those kinds of
 
06:06:57.270 --> 06:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
contracts because they lose a lot of
 
06:06:59.350 --> 06:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
independence the second thing is that
 
06:07:00.948 --> 06:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
even if you're authorized for one
 
06:07:03.510 --> 06:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
provider you aren't for the other one
 
06:07:05.350 --> 06:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
and what manufacturers are doing in this
 
06:07:05.360 --> 06:07:06.390 align:start position:0%
and what manufacturers are doing in this
space

06:07:06.390 --> 06:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
space
 
06:07:06.400 --> 06:07:07.270 align:start position:0%
space
is

06:07:07.270 --> 06:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:07:08.548 --> 06:07:08.558 align:start position:0%
they use
 
06:07:08.558 --> 06:07:09.350 align:start position:0%
they use
the

06:07:09.350 --> 06:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:07:11.190 --> 06:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
access to the parts and service
 
06:07:11.200 --> 06:07:12.628 align:start position:0%
access to the parts and service
documentation

06:07:12.628 --> 06:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
06:07:15.110 --> 06:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh to get people to become authorized
 
06:07:16.390 --> 06:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
because without that authorization you
 
06:07:17.750 --> 06:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
can't get access
 
06:07:19.750 --> 06:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
and then if you're authorized you have
 
06:07:22.390 --> 06:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
to do all the warranty jobs at a loss so
 
06:07:23.750 --> 06:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
let's just say you're authorized by
 
06:07:27.510 --> 06:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
company a you you come in to to you get
 
06:07:28.948 --> 06:07:28.958 align:start position:0%
the access to the parts and information
 
06:07:30.230 --> 06:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
but then you have to take the warranty
 
06:07:32.310 --> 06:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
jobs and you lose money on every single
 
06:07:34.230 --> 06:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
one of those warranty jobs
 
06:07:35.910 --> 06:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
and you
 
06:07:37.430 --> 06:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
you're limited to how many different
 
06:07:39.030 --> 06:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
oems you can partner with in that
 
06:07:41.270 --> 06:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
scenario because otherwise you just lose
 
06:07:43.350 --> 06:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
your shirt so even if there's whatever
 
06:07:44.628 --> 06:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
he said eleven thousand eighteen
 
06:07:46.628 --> 06:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
thousand independent uh you know
 
06:07:48.150 --> 06:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
authorized people they're only
 
06:07:49.830 --> 06:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
authorized for one or two companies so
 
06:07:52.548 --> 06:07:52.558 align:start position:0%
if you have a fridge made by samsung and
 
06:07:54.548 --> 06:07:54.558 align:start position:0%
they're authorized ge
 
06:07:57.350 --> 06:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know you just you don't have access
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
they have the same level of quality to
 
06:08:01.190 --> 06:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
satisfy samsung
 
06:08:03.190 --> 06:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
and they could satisfy ge but they can't
 
06:08:04.708 --> 06:08:04.718 align:start position:0%
do it just because they'd lose too much
 
06:08:04.718 --> 06:08:05.910 align:start position:0%
do it just because they'd lose too much
money

06:08:05.910 --> 06:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:08:07.830 --> 06:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
and so manufacturers are using this to
 
06:08:09.750 --> 06:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
kind of to kind of keep their warranty
 
06:08:11.430 --> 06:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
costs down but i think that has a couple
 
06:08:13.670 --> 06:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
impacts on consumers one manufacturers
 
06:08:15.510 --> 06:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
have a lower incentive to provide
 
06:08:17.990 --> 06:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
durable products because they're
 
06:08:20.708 --> 06:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
subsidizing the cost of their warranty
 
06:08:20.718 --> 06:08:21.830 align:start position:0%
subsidizing the cost of their warranty
service

06:08:21.830 --> 06:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
service
 
06:08:21.840 --> 06:08:23.030 align:start position:0%
service
repairs

06:08:23.030 --> 06:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
repairs
 
06:08:25.030 --> 06:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
the post warranty repair costs have to
 
06:08:27.110 --> 06:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
go up because the you know the
 
06:08:28.628 --> 06:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
independent repair people have to kind
 
06:08:30.470 --> 06:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
of make up for the losses they do on the
 
06:08:33.270 --> 06:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
warranty jobs um and then it lowers the
 
06:08:35.190 --> 06:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
availability of of the number of
 
06:08:37.110 --> 06:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
technicians so you have
 
06:08:39.510 --> 06:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
worse appliances that are harder to fix
 
06:08:41.750 --> 06:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
and and more expensive and so i think i
 
06:08:43.910 --> 06:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
think it's just unacceptable
 
06:08:45.430 --> 06:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
we should just have access to the parts
 
06:08:47.270 --> 06:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
and service information just like we did
 
06:08:48.948 --> 06:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
50 years ago
 
06:08:51.190 --> 06:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
this is a new change in the industry and
 
06:08:53.270 --> 06:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense for consumers and
 
06:08:55.510 --> 06:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
and already this is this is being done
 
06:08:57.830 --> 06:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
now in france and and the eu they passed
 
06:09:00.070 --> 06:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
a rule that they have to
 
06:09:02.230 --> 06:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's even it goes farther than this bill
 
06:09:04.150 --> 06:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
but this would just kind of get uh you
 
06:09:06.310 --> 06:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
know the the market in new hampshire up
 
06:09:07.670 --> 06:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
to speed with some with what they're
 
06:09:09.270 --> 06:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
doing in some other places and with that
 
06:09:09.280 --> 06:09:10.230 align:start position:0%
doing in some other places and with that
i'll

06:09:10.230 --> 06:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
06:09:13.110 --> 06:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'll wrap up my comments
 
06:09:14.788 --> 06:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
great uh we do have a question if you're
 
06:09:16.628 --> 06:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
willing to take one
 
06:09:19.110 --> 06:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative abramson
 
06:09:21.190 --> 06:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and uh thank you mr
 
06:09:23.910 --> 06:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
proctor for your uh testimony um i did
 
06:09:26.070 --> 06:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
have a question do you do you believe
 
06:09:27.750 --> 06:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's that uh
 
06:09:29.830 --> 06:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
a motivation or the motivation for
 
06:09:32.548 --> 06:09:32.558 align:start position:0%
manufacturers is that they're they're
 
06:09:35.030 --> 06:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
trying to uh overcharge consumers for
 
06:09:39.670 --> 06:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:42.390 --> 06:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
i you know i i don't not inside the the
 
06:09:43.830 --> 06:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
heads i mean
 
06:09:45.430 --> 06:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
the from talking to technicians i've
 
06:09:47.190 --> 06:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
talked to i think it's this dynamic
 
06:09:49.750 --> 06:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
which i just described which is they use
 
06:09:51.990 --> 06:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
it to control the cost of warranty
 
06:09:52.000 --> 06:09:53.030 align:start position:0%
it to control the cost of warranty
repairs

06:09:53.030 --> 06:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
repairs
 
06:09:54.628 --> 06:09:54.638 align:start position:0%
because they can say oh you can't get
 
06:09:56.788 --> 06:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
access to our you know part network or
 
06:09:58.708 --> 06:09:58.718 align:start position:0%
our service documentation unless you
 
06:10:01.430 --> 06:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
agree to do all the warranty jobs
 
06:10:04.070 --> 06:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know for this price even even though
 
06:10:06.470 --> 06:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
you're losing money on those um and so
 
06:10:06.480 --> 06:10:08.230 align:start position:0%
you're losing money on those um and so
if

06:10:08.230 --> 06:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:10:10.470 --> 06:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know if they were if they had an
 
06:10:12.868 --> 06:10:12.878 align:start position:0%
open market for repair then then they
 
06:10:14.470 --> 06:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
would they would have to be a little bit
 
06:10:16.390 --> 06:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
more honest with their warranty charges
 
06:10:17.830 --> 06:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
which i think would be good because i
 
06:10:19.430 --> 06:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
think that would increase their
 
06:10:21.030 --> 06:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
incentive to make products that don't
 
06:10:21.040 --> 06:10:22.390 align:start position:0%
incentive to make products that don't
break

06:10:22.390 --> 06:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
break
 
06:10:22.400 --> 06:10:23.430 align:start position:0%
break
follow-up

06:10:23.430 --> 06:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:10:25.670 --> 06:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire
 
06:10:28.070 --> 06:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
so is it the intent of this bill
 
06:10:30.868 --> 06:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
that uh local shops more local shops
 
06:10:32.708 --> 06:10:32.718 align:start position:0%
would be able to repair existing
 
06:10:32.718 --> 06:10:35.910 align:start position:0%
would be able to repair existing
appliances

06:10:35.910 --> 06:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:38.390 --> 06:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely yep and then i think some of
 
06:10:40.310 --> 06:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
the repair shops that are authorized by
 
06:10:43.670 --> 06:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
one manufacturer now can have access to
 
06:10:45.270 --> 06:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
the documentation for the other
 
06:10:47.110 --> 06:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturers if they get called in and
 
06:10:49.990 --> 06:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
there's both an lg and a ge product that
 
06:10:51.670 --> 06:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
they have to fix
 
06:10:53.430 --> 06:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
06:10:53.440 --> 06:10:56.628 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
representative

06:10:56.628 --> 06:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:59.030 --> 06:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for your
 
06:11:01.350 --> 06:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
testimony as well
 
06:11:03.270 --> 06:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to start my question with a
 
06:11:03.280 --> 06:11:05.110 align:start position:0%
i'm going to start my question with a
statement

06:11:05.110 --> 06:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
statement
 
06:11:06.548 --> 06:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:11:06.558 --> 06:11:08.310 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
has

06:11:08.310 --> 06:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
has
 
06:11:11.910 --> 06:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
six tenths of one percent
 
06:11:14.470 --> 06:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
of the nation's population
 
06:11:16.628 --> 06:11:16.638 align:start position:0%
so if new hampshire were the only state
 
06:11:17.830 --> 06:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
to have
 
06:11:17.840 --> 06:11:20.230 align:start position:0%
to have
this

06:11:20.230 --> 06:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:23.670 --> 06:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
bill passed is this law enacted
 
06:11:26.150 --> 06:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
we would probably have a lot of
 
06:11:29.990 --> 06:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
difficulty having uh the critical mass
 
06:11:32.948 --> 06:11:32.958 align:start position:0%
to uh to affect anything
 
06:11:35.030 --> 06:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
um can you tell us
 
06:11:35.040 --> 06:11:36.310 align:start position:0%
um can you tell us
uh

06:11:36.310 --> 06:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:11:38.948 --> 06:11:38.958 align:start position:0%
other state which states so far have
 
06:11:42.070 --> 06:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
this uh have this kind of bill uh in
 
06:11:42.080 --> 06:11:44.868 align:start position:0%
this uh have this kind of bill uh in
place

06:11:44.868 --> 06:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:11:44.878 --> 06:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
place
so

06:11:46.310 --> 06:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:11:48.628 --> 06:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
nationally there has been no
 
06:11:50.230 --> 06:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
appliance right to repair which has been
 
06:11:51.750 --> 06:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
passed or enacted
 
06:11:53.190 --> 06:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know right now
 
06:11:55.110 --> 06:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
across the country there are 19 states
 
06:11:56.830 --> 06:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
considering 31
 
06:12:00.390 --> 06:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
bills this is an issue which um is not
 
06:12:01.670 --> 06:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
going to go away
 
06:12:04.150 --> 06:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
consumers are unhappy with the status
 
06:12:06.230 --> 06:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
quo whether they be
 
06:12:07.590 --> 06:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know appliance consumers or cell
 
06:12:09.350 --> 06:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
phone consumers or track you know using
 
06:12:11.670 --> 06:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
tractors like this is uh it's pretty
 
06:12:13.430 --> 06:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous in the field
 
06:12:13.440 --> 06:12:14.310 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous in the field
uh

06:12:14.310 --> 06:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:12:17.430 --> 06:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
and it's you know it's it's gonna happen
 
06:12:19.830 --> 06:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
at some point uh you know i think we
 
06:12:21.910 --> 06:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
narrowed to appliances in part because i
 
06:12:24.628 --> 06:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that the repair
 
06:12:27.350 --> 06:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
control is quite as important to the
 
06:12:29.030 --> 06:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
appliance industry as it is to some of
 
06:12:30.628 --> 06:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
the other industries
 
06:12:32.548 --> 06:12:32.558 align:start position:0%
um and i don't think that that would be
 
06:12:34.788 --> 06:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
that challenging i mean i've heard on
 
06:12:36.628 --> 06:12:36.638 align:start position:0%
the back end that manufacturers kind of
 
06:12:38.230 --> 06:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
predict this will happen and they're
 
06:12:41.990 --> 06:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
just kind of waiting it out um
 
06:12:44.390 --> 06:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what i say
 
06:12:45.510 --> 06:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
all set
 
06:12:45.520 --> 06:12:47.030 align:start position:0%
all set
okay

06:12:47.030 --> 06:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:12:49.430 --> 06:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh having no more questions we thank you
 
06:12:52.150 --> 06:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony
 
06:12:52.160 --> 06:12:53.110 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony
and

06:12:53.110 --> 06:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:12:54.868 --> 06:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
always a little daring is there anybody
 
06:12:58.628 --> 06:12:58.638 align:start position:0%
in the attendees who would like to
 
06:13:01.590 --> 06:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:04.230 --> 06:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh see none
 
06:13:09.430 --> 06:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh so we had 25 people in support
 
06:13:12.470 --> 06:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
12 opposed and
 
06:13:15.030 --> 06:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
i will close the public hearing on oh
 
06:13:16.470 --> 06:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative fargo i'm sorry i'm
 
06:13:18.070 --> 06:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
looking down yes
 
06:13:20.150 --> 06:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
i know i just had one question i noticed
 
06:13:22.868 --> 06:13:22.878 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note on this and yet
 
06:13:22.878 --> 06:13:23.830 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note on this and yet
um

06:13:23.830 --> 06:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:25.750 --> 06:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
it has to be enforced by the attorney
 
06:13:28.788 --> 06:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
general's office is that a concern okay
 
06:13:30.788 --> 06:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:13:32.868 --> 06:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
i was going to discuss that when we had
 
06:13:34.830 --> 06:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
the attorney general on earlier
 
06:13:37.910 --> 06:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
um i've never seen a physical note come
 
06:13:39.990 --> 06:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
out of the ag's office
 
06:13:43.830 --> 06:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
okay so they so if if when they looked
 
06:13:44.948 --> 06:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
at the bill
 
06:13:46.470 --> 06:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
when a fiscal note they're sending it to
 
06:13:48.948 --> 06:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
a department agency you know the terms
 
06:13:51.830 --> 06:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
of who's going to write it um but ag's
 
06:13:51.840 --> 06:13:52.868 align:start position:0%
of who's going to write it um but ag's
office

06:13:52.868 --> 06:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
office
 
06:13:55.110 --> 06:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
is uh and that and
 
06:13:57.190 --> 06:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
what it was uh it was a miracle to get
 
06:13:58.708 --> 06:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state and the ag's
 
06:14:00.708 --> 06:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
office to actually do rules they
 
06:14:02.390 --> 06:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even do rules because they were
 
06:14:04.070 --> 06:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
constitutionally created so they felt
 
06:14:06.390 --> 06:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
that they were exempt from rumiking so
 
06:14:07.990 --> 06:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
but they did do rules they have done
 
06:14:11.110 --> 06:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
rules but fiscal notes i think this year
 
06:14:13.750 --> 06:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
there's been an incredible darth
 
06:14:16.868 --> 06:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes ever generated but in terms
 
06:14:18.948 --> 06:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
of getting one out of that out of the
 
06:14:21.910 --> 06:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
ag's office for implementation um
 
06:14:23.430 --> 06:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're gonna say it's it's
 
06:14:25.510 --> 06:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
undeterminable but you know i mean he
 
06:14:28.390 --> 06:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
did make it clear in that one bill that
 
06:14:30.470 --> 06:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
that it would be the telephone robocall
 
06:14:33.350 --> 06:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
it would be a huge uh huge project that
 
06:14:34.868 --> 06:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
you know how many people you have to
 
06:14:38.070 --> 06:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
hire right and i just i guess that kind
 
06:14:39.990 --> 06:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
of raised some concerns with me if we're
 
06:14:41.590 --> 06:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
going to enforce that through through
 
06:14:43.430 --> 06:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
their office and he already says his
 
06:14:45.430 --> 06:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
staff is at capacity
 
06:14:47.030 --> 06:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know how are we going to be able to
 
06:14:49.830 --> 06:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
do that right right and yeah then the
 
06:14:53.590 --> 06:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
idea of chasing um some samsung
 
06:14:53.600 --> 06:14:54.548 align:start position:0%
idea of chasing um some samsung
to

06:14:54.548 --> 06:14:54.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:14:56.230 --> 06:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
give us the manual it might be a little
 
06:14:56.240 --> 06:14:57.750 align:start position:0%
give us the manual it might be a little
tricky

06:14:57.750 --> 06:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
tricky
 
06:14:59.430 --> 06:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
but i don't know
 
06:15:01.670 --> 06:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sometimes it's better on
 
06:15:03.910 --> 06:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
these just to have a cause of action for
 
06:15:06.470 --> 06:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
someone they can take it to if
 
06:15:08.310 --> 06:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
if they want to spend the money sue
 
06:15:09.910 --> 06:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
don't you max you've said this a couple
 
06:15:11.590 --> 06:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
of times today you just like i always
 
06:15:13.190 --> 06:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
say small claims
 
06:15:17.190 --> 06:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:17.200 --> 06:15:18.150 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:15:18.150 --> 06:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:15:20.868 --> 06:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
you you'd be lucky to get a
 
06:15:22.548 --> 06:15:22.558 align:start position:0%
judgment against them
 
06:15:25.110 --> 06:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
international corporation good luck
 
06:15:27.670 --> 06:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
but they do all usa divisions i guess so
 
06:15:29.590 --> 06:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
06:15:30.948 --> 06:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
good luck but
 
06:15:32.708 --> 06:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
all right so rich i assume your hands up
 
06:15:34.310 --> 06:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
just because you're still up and we're
 
06:15:35.750 --> 06:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
everybody all set
 
06:15:38.628 --> 06:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
so we have miraculously gone through all
 
06:15:39.910 --> 06:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
our hearings
 
06:15:42.868 --> 06:15:42.878 align:start position:0%
so uh which is and this is uh you know
 
06:15:42.878 --> 06:15:44.230 align:start position:0%
so uh which is and this is uh you know
in

06:15:44.230 --> 06:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:15:47.270 --> 06:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
well i have to say having having a zoom
 
06:15:48.868 --> 06:15:48.878 align:start position:0%
meeting starting at nine we've been able
 
06:15:51.670 --> 06:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
to do things a lot faster um i'm very
 
06:15:53.350 --> 06:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
pleased to say that we stayed pretty
 
06:15:55.430 --> 06:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
well on time i think i did good in
 
06:15:58.548 --> 06:15:58.558 align:start position:0%
scheduling time you did you did
 
06:16:00.628 --> 06:16:00.638 align:start position:0%
and we didn't have too much uh over and
 
06:16:02.390 --> 06:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
we certainly you know had no five
 
06:16:04.470 --> 06:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
o'clock session uh study you know work
 
06:16:06.548 --> 06:16:06.558 align:start position:0%
section so that this works good
 
06:16:09.030 --> 06:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
um and as i said earlier on just in case
 
06:16:10.708 --> 06:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
some of you weren't here with that so
 
06:16:14.150 --> 06:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
next tuesday um we got a day off from
 
06:16:16.948 --> 06:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
commerce and then but the following week
 
06:16:19.270 --> 06:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
we'll um i'll start you know scheduling
 
06:16:21.350 --> 06:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
bills to to exact
 
06:16:23.030 --> 06:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
do you expect it'll be both tuesday and
 
06:16:25.270 --> 06:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
wednesday i'll switch i have to find out
 
06:16:26.628 --> 06:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
whether they'll give me the wednesday
 
06:16:28.390 --> 06:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
because i know you know this wednesday
 
06:16:31.750 --> 06:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
was for us to push to the hearing so um
 
06:16:34.470 --> 06:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
but we'll see how it goes and um and
 
06:16:35.910 --> 06:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
i'll you know i'll be in conversation
 
06:16:37.590 --> 06:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
with you chrissy once once i have an
 
06:16:39.510 --> 06:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
idea where where we republicans are
 
06:16:42.470 --> 06:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
going so that so that we can maybe i i i
 
06:16:45.030 --> 06:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
would hope as i you know that we can go
 
06:16:47.270 --> 06:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
through our exact session painlessly
 
06:16:48.548 --> 06:16:48.558 align:start position:0%
without too much
 
06:16:49.990 --> 06:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know drawn i mean i know obviously
 
06:16:51.430 --> 06:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be on the same page
 
06:16:53.030 --> 06:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
for everything but there are some things
 
06:16:55.670 --> 06:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
where we can and and i and
 
06:16:56.788 --> 06:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
obviously this year we're going to
 
06:16:56.798 --> 06:16:57.910 align:start position:0%
obviously this year we're going to
retain

06:16:57.910 --> 06:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
retain
 
06:17:00.070 --> 06:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
more bills than we've ever done before
 
06:17:01.750 --> 06:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
um and i don't feel bad about that
 
06:17:04.070 --> 06:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
because no just i was planning to go to
 
06:17:06.070 --> 06:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
england and how they're saying we're not
 
06:17:08.788 --> 06:17:08.798 align:start position:0%
going england until 2022 so so much for
 
06:17:08.798 --> 06:17:10.310 align:start position:0%
going england until 2022 so so much for
that

06:17:10.310 --> 06:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:17:12.470 --> 06:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh don't just go earlier you know wait
 
06:17:14.070 --> 06:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
till i go home i don't think i'm going
 
06:17:14.080 --> 06:17:15.430 align:start position:0%
till i go home i don't think i'm going
earlier

06:17:15.430 --> 06:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
06:17:17.670 --> 06:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
anyways okay cancel that trip to south
 
06:17:21.270 --> 06:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
africa yes yeah good idea um it is the
 
06:17:23.430 --> 06:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
last time i was in europe was in the off
 
06:17:26.230 --> 06:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
year in september yeah
 
06:17:28.548 --> 06:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
um it's my kids i got to see
 
06:17:29.990 --> 06:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's been three years
 
06:17:31.910 --> 06:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
at this point i would urge everybody to
 
06:17:33.750 --> 06:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
be aware that yeah we'll we'll do these
 
06:17:33.760 --> 06:17:34.390 align:start position:0%
be aware that yeah we'll we'll do these
bills

06:17:34.390 --> 06:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
bills
 
06:17:36.150 --> 06:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
i mean we don't you know we're when we
 
06:17:37.430 --> 06:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
do these subcommittees in the up we
 
06:17:38.948 --> 06:17:38.958 align:start position:0%
don't we're not too busy i mean i
 
06:17:40.948 --> 06:17:40.958 align:start position:0%
usually just one day a week is enough
 
06:17:42.868 --> 06:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
because we actually have like six weeks
 
06:17:44.230 --> 06:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
to get through things
 
06:17:47.990 --> 06:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
so um and and we'll i'll have again
 
06:17:49.750 --> 06:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
we'll try to break up in divisions we'll
 
06:17:49.760 --> 06:17:51.350 align:start position:0%
we'll try to break up in divisions we'll
revisit
