uh thank you representative led and for
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
the record
 
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
i'm alone in my house in durham if
 
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so um let me start
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
by saying i really appreciate the
 
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to the
 
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um this is a critical issue
 
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire and all
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
our residents
 
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
i mean reading the language of house
 
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
bill 2 is primarily focused on
 
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
the appointment process for this new
 
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.590 align:start position:0%
the appointment process for this new
superboard

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
superboard
 
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
but it did cite four things that were
 
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
the goals and that is to provide
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
an effective and efficient system of
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
public higher education that is
 
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.590 align:start position:0%
public higher education that is
affordable

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 align:start position:0%
and accessible so i think we should look
 
00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
at that and see what the current status
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
is of the current context
 
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
for that first the university system of
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has the highest graduation
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
rate of any four-year public system in
 
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
new england
 
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
the community college system has the
 
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
highest graduation
 
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 align:start position:0%
rate of any two-year public system
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
public system in new england so i think
 
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
you can check the effectiveness box
 
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of efficiency is documented
 
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
by kathy provencher at a presentation
 
00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 align:start position:0%
last week to division two
 
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
the university system has the lowest
 
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
administrative costs of any public
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
higher education system in new england
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
and i could not find
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
comparable data for the community
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
college system but i think we all know
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
how administratively lean
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
they are so i think if we can
 
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that they're extremely
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
efficient so we can check that box and
 
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.029 align:start position:0%
efficient so we can check that box and
moreover

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
moreover
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
um the university system is engaged in a
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
multi-year process has been for
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
streamlining its backroom operations
 
00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
called far
 
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
financial and administrative
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
reorganization that will prove
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
within the aggregate with other efforts
 
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
will produce savings of 70 million
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
dollars by
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2023 their commitment to
 
00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:09.430 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2023 their commitment to
efficiency

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh cannot be denied we look at
 
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.710 align:start position:0%
uh cannot be denied we look at
affordability

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
we look at the community college system
 
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.749 align:start position:0%
we look at the community college system
um

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
in the last decade has increased its per
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
credit hour treasury
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
rate from 210 to 215 dollars
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
a total of about two percent in a decade
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
not not per year
 
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
over the whole time so they're really
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
committed to keeping that rate as low as
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
possible and in fact other community
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
college systems have
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
caught up with the university system
 
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.350 align:start position:0%
caught up with the university system
given

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
its rather i think we acknowledge low
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
level of state
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
subsidy or state appropriations support
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
has always had higher
 
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 align:start position:0%
uh tuition rates and it's functioned for
 
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
a long time on a
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
on a higher tuition rate higher aid kind
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
of philosophy and
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
for many decades embrace the notion of
 
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.629 align:start position:0%
for many decades embrace the notion of
well

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
the out of state tuition rate should be
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
higher because they provide a subsidy
 
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
for the in-state students also in-state
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
rates should be higher
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
um and we started this in 1980 on the
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
advice of a
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
then governor in that time that go with
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
a high tuition high rate approach
 
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
and we embraced a financial aid package
 
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
that we called meeting all need
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
that that proc that meeting all need
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh existed until uh the legislature
 
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately can cut the state of
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
operating appropriation by 50 percent to
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
the average system
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
but now it's in a different form with
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
only dealing with tuition
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
in the granite guarantee so again the
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
commitment is there to reducing the net
 
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.029 align:start position:0%
commitment is there to reducing the net
price

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
price
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh for students and sustaining that
 
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.469 align:start position:0%
uh for students and sustaining that
affordability

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
in terms of access i think
 
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
we can we know about the commitment of
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
the community college in particular to
 
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
individuals in high school the
 
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
long standing success with running start
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
and under representative lads leadership
 
00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
support appropriation with support for
 
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.230 align:start position:0%
support appropriation with support for
gained

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
gained
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
gain for dual and concurrent courses
 
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
stem courses in support of that they
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
also have the early college initiative
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
e-start there's a number of ways in high
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
school students in new hampshire
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
can gain college access or college
 
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
credits which are then
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
fully transferable moreover the
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
community colleges by their very nature
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
are nimble and respond to local business
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
needs and i would say that's true also
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
the university system
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
if you look at how these systems have
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
been so effective and efficient
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
for decades it's because they've been
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
responsive to student
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
local state and regional in some cases
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
even national needs
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
in terms of student services so there's
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of success there
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
um i want to also mention one aspect
 
00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:48.550 align:start position:0%
um i want to also mention one aspect
about

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
the the university system success and
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
recruiting out of state students
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's been a tremendous economic
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
benefit for the state of new hampshire
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
how many of those students then stay in
 
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.230 align:start position:0%
how many of those students then stay in
state

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
and then feed our pipeline and help
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
address our workforce
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
issues not only is it their economic
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
impact while they're here and paying
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
tuition and their parents and
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
family are coming for events but staying
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
afterwards but also
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
it enables us to create the critical
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
mass to offer many academic programs
 
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
that would not otherwise be able to been
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
offered if we were strictly
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
relying on our in-state population could
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
we have chemical engineering we have
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
electrical engineering
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
without 50 or more of the students being
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
from out of state
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think you have a sufficient
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
critical mass so that's been critical so
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
when you look at the
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
the track record of both systems to date
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's been a success
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
and during this particular time they're
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
both dealing with the
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
impact of covid as cathy preventure
 
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.310 align:start position:0%
impact of covid as cathy preventure
testified

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
testified
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
160 million dollars in lost revenue and
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
increased expenses were incurred
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
as a result of covid and
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
while there'll be there is state and
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
federal aid and hopefully more to come
 
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's only going to cover a fraction
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
that just compounds it
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
the the pressures on these these systems
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
so now let's look if that's the context
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
what are the important questions that
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
raised in order to fully consider the
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
the issue before you and are there
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
alternative paths to take
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
well again in house bill 2
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
there are no specific issues raised
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
let's identify
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
what are the set of issues to be
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
addressed and what are the desired
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
outcomes and why not provide the
 
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.190 align:start position:0%
outcomes and why not provide the
opportunity

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
to the current independent boards to
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
respond to those
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's not sufficient in my
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
perspective simply state
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
the creation new super bowl will somehow
 
00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:45.509 align:start position:0%
the creation new super bowl will somehow
accelerate

00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
accelerate
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
resolution of perceived issues when
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
they're not even clear what they are
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
the current boards really consist of
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated individuals
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
that do represent the experiences and
 
00:10:57.839 --> 00:10:58.550 align:start position:0%
that do represent the experiences and
skills

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
skills
 
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
need to achieve their respective
 
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.670 align:start position:0%
need to achieve their respective
missions

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
missions
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
the 23 person super board essentially
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
is all uh and will be all individuals
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
appointed to a political process and we
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
can walk through the 23
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
names every in each a case of the
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
nominations from the
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
current university system or community
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
college boards each has to be
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
individually approved by the governor
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
before going to executive council
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
the governor nominates his own five
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
individuals that's 15. the other eight
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
are the governor representative from the
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
house representative from the senate
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
four commissioners and finally the
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
chancellor who will be appointed by this
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
new board
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
so essentially all political
 
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.269 align:start position:0%
so essentially all political
appointments

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
i think there is an existing mechanism
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
that should consideration should be
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
given to how to examine this
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
this issue there's a synergies group
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
made up of representatives from the
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
community college system and the
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
university system that's been meeting
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
since last july
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
they are collaborating on joint
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
initiatives and with a particular focus
 
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.150 align:start position:0%
initiatives and with a particular focus
on

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
transfer issues and this is really
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
critically important because
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
those issues have embedded in them
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
the need for adherence to meeting
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
learning outcome expectations
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
for the respective academic institutions
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
that are that would be accepting the
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
these credits and transfer for either an
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
institutional level or specific program
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
level so if the real issue that's being
 
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:28.790 align:start position:0%
level so if the real issue that's being
raised

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
can we facilitate transfer in one manner
 
00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:32.870 align:start position:0%
can we facilitate transfer in one manner
another

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
let's have a group of individuals who
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
have the expertise and the experience
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to those academic issues
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
deal with it
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
i do not think there's really any
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for meaningful
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
cost savings because of the initiatives
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
because of documented already
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
efficient operations and the initiatives
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
all underway in particular
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
at the university system there is a
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
to have the synergies group report to a
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
legislative body the public higher
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
education study committee
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
and if you read the charter of that
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
committee it says explicitly
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to study the
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
operation goals and purposes
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
organization size and financing of
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
public higher education in the state
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
isn't that exactly what this is about so
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
why not
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
charge the synergies group or some
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
entity to make a recommendation
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
or to analyze whatever the specific
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
issues that are being raised
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
and have that entity then recommend
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
to the public higher education study
 
00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:36.230 align:start position:0%
to the public higher education study
committee

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
their findings report those findings
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
that again the public higher education
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
study committee is the entity that was
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
established to hold the public irish
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
education systems accountable and then
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
based on that report
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
then the public higher education study
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
committee can make right
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the legislature about
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
what actions if any
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
should be taken and what the timeline is
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
to accomplish any
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
measurable outcomes that need to be
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
addressed so again let's identify what
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
are the issues that need to be addressed
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
specifically what are the outcomes what
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
are the metrics what are the
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
quantifiable metrics that need to be met
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
and then have some entity an entity with
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
the expertise
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
report back to the public higher
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
education study committee on the
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
timeline for doing that maybe the
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
dollars that will be needed to
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish those also and and that seems
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
to be a more reasonable process and
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
creating a super board and and no
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
process for
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
the subsequent filling of the of those
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
seats and the
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation in my view seems to put
 
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
the cart before the horse
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm just um suggesting that there
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
may be
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
um a better way to approach addressing
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
whatever issues may be out there
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative led and i'm
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry i couldn't hear you um
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
representative lad i think you have
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
muted i i had myself muted because i got
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
a little two-year-old running around out
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
back there and
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
i i wanted uh to not interfere with what
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
you were saying but i
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there's many questions which we
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
have and so are
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
you good with just participating with us
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
for the next hour or so
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
and and helping us out with some of
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
the our discussion and questions i am
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you ed um so i'll i'll i'll start
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
out with one question here
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
and one of the issues that has been
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
at stake here and and as a pops up in
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
everybody's mind initially
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
is our tuition costs for the community
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
college system
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
are significantly lower than that of the
 
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:44.949 align:start position:0%
are significantly lower than that of the
uh

00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
the four-year schools even within the
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
four-year schools we have different
 
00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:50.069 align:start position:0%
four-year schools we have different
tuitioning

00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
tuitioning
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
costs um in your uh
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
working previously with various uh
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
college and university systems and i'm
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
sure you have
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
um and even within uh
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
in the effort to do these types of
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
studies like
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
consolidating our structure and our
 
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.030 align:start position:0%
consolidating our structure and our
organization

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
have we seen the tuition costs
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
changed in those districts which have
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
gone for us in those states where
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
they've moved forward to
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
get one overseeing board or
 
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
do those disparities between costs
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
still exist i i think in
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
general the disparities in cost
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
still exist however let me say there
 
00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:36.550 align:start position:0%
still exist however let me say there
because

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
of those efforts to merge
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
there is often pressure on
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
the faculty from the faculty and staff
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the community college system
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
typically on generalizing here
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
to raise the compensation levels and to
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
equalize those things so costs actually
 
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.150 align:start position:0%
equalize those things so costs actually
may

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
increase on that increasing the pressure
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
to equalize
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
in some ways the tuition
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
the the i'm more familiar with the
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
efforts within
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
new england although again the end gems
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
report that was referenced earlier
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
um does have some national information
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
and there has been
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
in that case some national examples but
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
um i i think there would
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
it would be critical and again the board
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
if there was such a merger
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
that superboy would have to have the
 
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.590 align:start position:0%
that superboy would have to have the
authority

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
to set tuition um and
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
one would hope but again um it's unclear
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
that they would be respectful of the
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
need of the community college system in
 
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.230 align:start position:0%
need of the community college system in
particular

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
to maintain the lowest cost of a
 
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.070 align:start position:0%
to maintain the lowest cost of a
possible

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
price because it's not only the reason
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
the recent high school graduates is all
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
those adults and part-time learners and
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
we can talk about the financial aid
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
available through the 529 commission and
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
others that will help
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
address that so i think um
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
some kinds of differentiation in the
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
price is absolutely critical going forth
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
because there's different populations
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
being served so i'll stop there
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm going to open it
 
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
up to uh the committee to ask questions
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative miler uh uh thank you
 
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.070 align:start position:0%
uh representative miler uh uh thank you
uh

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
rep representing vlad uh dr mckay
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
the question one of the questions that
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
we deal with you currently have
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
vacancies in both the chancellors of
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
both systems
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
they're they're in a uh i believe
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
they're currently in a search
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
process to identify uh qualified
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
applicants etc
 
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
what's your recommendation if if this
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
were to go forward if we were to take
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
your recommendation to take some time to
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
really look at this
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
and have a significant study
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the vision of higher
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
education for the state
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
and how does this potential merger fit
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
that particular vision
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
what's your suggestions on the search
 
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.230 align:start position:0%
what's your suggestions on the search
process

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
that's currently taking place within
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
both systems
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
and what would your recommendations be
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
regarding that that's one of my
 
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.710 align:start position:0%
regarding that that's one of my
questions

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
that is challenging and to be candid i i
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
think it will
 
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
it's going to impact the ability to hire
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
the best person for this if there's not
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
a clear commitment to
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
maintaining the separate systems if it's
 
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.590 align:start position:0%
maintaining the separate systems if it's
in

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
in question then i would recommend as
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
if as a result of your deliberations and
 
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.110 align:start position:0%
if as a result of your deliberations and
decisions

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
throughout this legislative process if
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
if the ultimate answer
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
of whether to merge or not is still in
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
question then i would recommend
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
for the next year hiring another
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
interim because i think it will
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
make it more difficult to sustain the
 
00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.750 align:start position:0%
make it more difficult to sustain the
commitment

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
of an individual for what typically is
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
at least a four or five year
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
expectation um because of this uh
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
cloud that would be hanging over it uh
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
so until that is
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
resolved i think there will be an impact
 
00:20:11.679 --> 00:20:12.710 align:start position:0%
resolved i think there will be an impact
um

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately so you're basically saying
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
that there should be a suspension
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
of any further uh um
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
search for these uh
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
for the for replacements of these two
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
positions then
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
yes i i think that would that would be
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
my recommendation if i was a candidate
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
for any position like this
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
i would want to know that i have the
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
ability over the next four or five years
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
to make a difference
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
and if that's not clear
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
then i i think that may have may in
 
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
some way restrict the african pool now i
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
know there's been a lot of
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
um interest expressed in these positions
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
but that was
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
may have been prior to this announcement
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
of the proposed merging
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
another question i guess i have too is
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
that it appears if you look at the data
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
particularly with the community college
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
a growing reliance on the use of
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
adjunct professors vis-a-vis that
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
full-time now granted there needs to be
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
a balance
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
i understand that because in some ways
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
you want to have
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
practitioners in the field working with
 
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:28.870 align:start position:0%
practitioners in the field working with
students

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand it looks like
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps one of the ways that the tuition
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
at least at the community colleges has
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
been maintained at a lower rate
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
is because they use the adjunct
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
professors which obviously
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
costs less not as much overhead there's
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
not as much
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
benefits etc so one of the concerns i
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
have is that the reliance on adjuncts
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
visiting that of full-time professors at
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
the at the
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
university level any do you have any
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
thoughts about that
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
as it relates to this combining these
 
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.909 align:start position:0%
as it relates to this combining these
institutions

00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
right well let me just say as a
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
generality throughout new england and
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
nationally you're seeing greater
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
reliance on
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
adjunct part-time sometimes
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
full-time individuals that are hired as
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
instructors for example
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
i and i think part of it is a car saving
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
but also very importantly it does enable
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
the institution
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
to be more nimble to respond to emerging
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
areas of interest and provide
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
specific expertise in those those areas
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's a much appreciative and valued
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
component to the overall faculty
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
load i i do think the reality going
 
00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:49.029 align:start position:0%
load i i do think the reality going
forward

00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
um given the demographic headwinds
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
that the state of new hampshire and
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
all of new england are facing is that i
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
don't see any
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
expansion in the ten the number of
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
tenure track faculty
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
or nominal expansion and probably
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
through this period
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh sustaining that number of adjunct
 
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.510 align:start position:0%
uh sustaining that number of adjunct
faculty

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
faculty
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
is that the best for the longer term no
 
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
but i think the real
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
the financial reality facing is that is
 
00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:16.950 align:start position:0%
the financial reality facing is that is
where

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
we are at this point and where we're
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
likely to be unfortunately for the next
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative ellison i um okay let me
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
go rick is
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
taking care of the two-year-old i think
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
no i just had to
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
answer the phone the other end so yes go
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
ahead art uh thank you
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you ed for for being here
 
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.549 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you ed for for being here
today

00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh i i would start by saying i share
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
mel's concern about the numbers
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
of adjunct professors in the community
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
college system
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
but my question i guess getting down
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
into the weeds on this
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
is the synergies group
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
is there a timeline for them to contin
 
00:23:59.360 --> 00:23:59.990 align:start position:0%
is there a timeline for them to contin
to

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
sort of finish their work uh
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
and the second question is given what's
 
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.510 align:start position:0%
and the second question is given what's
transpired

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
transpired
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
in the budget and the reason we're all
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
talking are they fairly nimble to
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
start to maybe refocus their work in a
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
different way because of the urgency of
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
i i do not know of a deadline or
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
timeline for the completion of their
 
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.710 align:start position:0%
timeline for the completion of their
work

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
i would say this would be their priority
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
and they would refocus and
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
for example you could ask them to
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
complete an analysis of the issues
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
identified and the specific outcomes uh
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
desired once those are made by i think
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
the end of this
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
calendar year by sometime in the fall so
 
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
report could be received by the public
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
higher education study committee
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
and i think it would be incumbent um
 
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.269 align:start position:0%
and i think it would be incumbent um
upon

00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
upon
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
both of the independent boards now to
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that the representatives on that
 
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:00.950 align:start position:0%
ensure that the representatives on that
synergy

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
synergy
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
group address that issue as their issues
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
as their top priority so i
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
would i believe representative ellison
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
it can and should
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh take precedent over other issues
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
now especially if they may relate as i
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
believe that be the case to the academic
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
area because there are
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
mechanisms already in place with regard
 
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.149 align:start position:0%
mechanisms already in place with regard
to

00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
the finance and administrative structure
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh ed i have a a sort of a follow-up
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
question when we were talking about the
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
position of chancellor
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
and that you have held uh and in
 
00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.710 align:start position:0%
and that you have held uh and in
speaking

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
with our two past chancellors uh
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
roscatel and todd leach
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
i was informed um that the chancellor
 
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.190 align:start position:0%
i was informed um that the chancellor
position

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
in this state is not as strong as it is
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
in some other states in terms of
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
statutory authority
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh is that in our restructuring process
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
um obviously we're still i would think
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
going to need to have chancellors or
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
is there any need for us to address that
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
position which
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
the duties of the chancellor and the
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
authority of the chancellor verse those
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
of the presidents of the various
 
00:26:17.039 --> 00:26:22.549 align:start position:0%
of the presidents of the various
institutions

00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
so the the question was you know it for
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
you ed
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
dr mckay um
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
the authority of the chancellor versus
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
the authority of the presidents of the
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
colleges and the universities
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
um do we have to look at those job
 
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.590 align:start position:0%
um do we have to look at those job
descriptions

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
descriptions
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities if we're going to
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
go through a restructuring process
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
absolutely i attempt to attempt to talk
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
through it
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
and without getting too much in the
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
weeds i believe
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
that based on personal experience and my
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
observations and other systems
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
the chancellor of the system
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
ought to be the the ceo and that all the
 
00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.269 align:start position:0%
ought to be the the ceo and that all the
presidents

00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
presidents
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
ought to report to that chancellor that
 
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.549 align:start position:0%
ought to report to that chancellor that
was

00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
the procedure and and internal
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
in the university system until 2013
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
um i didn't i left at that time
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
because i believed it was not in the
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
best long-term interest of the
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
functioning of the system
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
to have the president's report directly
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
as a board i understand
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
and todd dealt with that so i now i
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
think there is some revisiting of that
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
and so again my personal bias
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
on this is that there ought to be a
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
single ceo
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
that the board can hold accountable for
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
the results of the performance of the um
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
institutions and their respective ceos
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
i do not believe in staff that's a
 
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.870 align:start position:0%
i do not believe in staff that's a
problem

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
i think that's a internal problem to
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
each of
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
the governing boards if not sufficient
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
latitude and authorities given to the
 
00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:00.789 align:start position:0%
latitude and authorities given to the
chancellor

00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
chancellor
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much dr mckay um are
 
00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:03.909 align:start position:0%
thank you very much dr mckay um are
there

00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh questions from from the committee i
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
see a uh uh
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
dr ford yes uh dr mckay
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
um i'm a former ace fellow and i've been
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
involved in some of these uh
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
merger things minnesota in particular
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
as well as massachusetts um one of the
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
things that bothered me most
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
in the n champs report was the fact that
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
when they merged into systems of one
 
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.149 align:start position:0%
when they merged into systems of one
system

00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
only one shall we say category
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
wound up getting the real attention and
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
that that concerned me a great deal
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
because then they go on to ask for
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
something like system-wide
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh accreditation and
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
i think that if you get too far behind
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
on the institution you don't know what
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
you're accrediting
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
i representative for i share your
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
concerns and i think that is a a
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
particular issue that needs to be
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
addressed as part of your deliberations
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
with regard to the issue i
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
i i think the community college
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
is committed to its its mission i think
 
00:29:19.919 --> 00:29:20.230 align:start position:0%
is committed to its its mission i think
the

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
individuals on that board are committed
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
to it and addressing
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
local business needs local and i do
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
worry that they're
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
that would not always be the case if the
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
systems emerged
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
i mean in the university system we
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
worked hard to
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
make sure that each institution within
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
had a distinctive aspect to it
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
unh was a land grant sea grant space
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
grant institution
 
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
plymouth regional public university
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
king ko plaque which is a public liberal
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
arts college
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
granite state was a focused on adult
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
learners throughout this
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to maintain the
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
distinctiveness of each of those
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
entities and i do worry as
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
you you create a larger system that some
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
will be less attention paid to those
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
distinctive needs
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
and that one institution may have a
 
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.430 align:start position:0%
and that one institution may have a
disproportionate

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
disproportionate
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so i'd like to follow that up
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
with either
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
you know the past president of of lowell
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
or the you know the past chancellor for
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
the university system now
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
do we have uh some evidence out there
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
that where these consolidations have
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
been made
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
and what occurs or occurred
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
is similar to what dr ford was
 
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.510 align:start position:0%
is similar to what dr ford was
referencing

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
referencing
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
uh is that as something that
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
is quite possibly going to happen where
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
the the mission
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
of the community college system becomes
 
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.470 align:start position:0%
of the community college system becomes
lost

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
lost
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
or the mission to engage in
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
certification pathways which build
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
two skills is that going to get lost
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
versus the
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh the traditional four-year uh degree
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
masters and going on with doctoral
 
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.430 align:start position:0%
masters and going on with doctoral
programs

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
i think that's a risk i i i have
 
00:31:14.159 --> 00:31:15.110 align:start position:0%
i think that's a risk i i i have
characterized

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
characterized
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
this initiative as high risk low reward
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
and that would be one of the risks that
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um one other question i
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
don't see people putting their hands up
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
so if you put your hands up i can
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
see it but we have a declining
 
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:34.950 align:start position:0%
see it but we have a declining
demographic

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
demographic
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
in this state obviously k-12 population
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
has just dropped off significantly we
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
all know that and we've all thrown
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
around the
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
you know the figures um and so that
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
certainly uh shrinks the pool of
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
eligibility or
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
pool students which are going to go on
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
to a
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
system here in new hampshire and of
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
course we have the issue
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
of competition that's occurring from
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
others other states around us
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
namely you know massachusetts and maine
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
so uh in dealing with this
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
we can deal with it as vermont maybe did
 
00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:10.950 align:start position:0%
we can deal with it as vermont maybe did
by

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
increasing the number of out-of-state
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
students so we start
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
having you know the money come in
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
through the tuition
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
that i think's a catch-22 for vermont
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
they're at the point now where there's
 
00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:21.350 align:start position:0%
they're at the point now where there's
up

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
close to 70 80 percent out-of-state
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
students and and it's
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
it's still in economic trouble
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
we also have the situation where we may
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
have duplication of various departments
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
from keene to plymouth to unh
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
have we looked at consolidation of
 
00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:39.830 align:start position:0%
have we looked at consolidation of
programs

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
to certain locations within our state so
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
eliminate some of its duplicity so
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
demographics is
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
causing some issues uh are there any
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
ways to resolve this issue
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
without having to change our whole
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
structure and organization uh ed
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
i believe there are um let me just say
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
you cited uvm which it does have less i
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
saw 78
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
of its um students were out of state but
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's separate from
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
the vermont um college and community
 
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.269 align:start position:0%
the vermont um college and community
college

00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
system which is really struggling um
 
00:33:13.919 --> 00:33:14.310 align:start position:0%
system which is really struggling um
they

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
merged lyndon and johnson state colleges
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
in the northern
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
vermont university now they're merging
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
that with
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
castleton and so there's a lot of issues
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
there and they do not
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
have um that proportion of out-of-state
 
00:33:28.399 --> 00:33:29.110 align:start position:0%
have um that proportion of out-of-state
students

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
again the universe system has been very
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
the residential campus is very effective
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
but it will be a continuing challenge
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned that part of the
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
critical issue here is this critical
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
mass with
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
offer programs so i think one of the
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
things to
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
to um look to in the future and some
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
campuses are beginning to the university
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
of maine system is being explored that
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
a program hosted primarily at one
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
campus and one department but then
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
offered in multiple
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
sites so that students have access to
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
programs wherever they may
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
attend i think with the pivoting to
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
various methods of academic program
 
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.310 align:start position:0%
various methods of academic program
delivery

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
last spring there is much more comfort
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
and expertise with regarding to deliver
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
programs online especially from our
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
traditionally residential campuses than
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
there had been previously
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
so i think that actually has opened the
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
door to more of
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
these opportunities and if in
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
enrollments at a particular residential
 
00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:35.829 align:start position:0%
enrollments at a particular residential
campus

00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
campus
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
decline and but you can offer students
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
on that residential campus the
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
same access or maybe greater access to
 
00:34:43.119 --> 00:34:44.389 align:start position:0%
same access or maybe greater access to
other

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
academic programs that may be primarily
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
housed at another
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh institution i i think that is a
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to be explored and i
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
think we'll see more of that
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
that is program sharing if you will
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
or ways to enable individuals
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state to gain act greater
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
access to programs that may be primarily
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you art uh
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you rick uh ed just a question
 
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.550 align:start position:0%
thank you rick uh ed just a question
about

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh financing which obviously
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have an answer to yet but there
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
appears to be
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh some feeling on the part of some
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
people that a merger
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
will result in cost savings down the
 
00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.750 align:start position:0%
will result in cost savings down the
road

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
road
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh just your view of
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
sort of that issue and how possible that
 
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.430 align:start position:0%
sort of that issue and how possible that
is

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
and yeah how possible that would be
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
based on your experience uh within the
 
00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:45.910 align:start position:0%
based on your experience uh within the
state

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
and your knowledge of other states
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
i thank you representative ellison for
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
that question i
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
and as documented previously the
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
university system and the community
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
college system
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
already have very low administrative
 
00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:01.750 align:start position:0%
already have very low administrative
costs

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
and the university system is engaged in
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
this far
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
effort finance and administrative
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
reorganization to
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
further reduce those costs i think the
 
00:36:11.839 --> 00:36:12.470 align:start position:0%
further reduce those costs i think the
whatever

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
incremental um savings would be
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
available through this merger are de
 
00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:18.950 align:start position:0%
available through this merger are de
minimis

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
minimis
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
i mean i i i don't i think no one should
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
expect that there'd be any
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
substantive financial savings
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
i just want to be candid about that i
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
see no evidence for that
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you transferability of credits
 
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.310 align:start position:0%
thank you transferability of credits
okay

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead dave you go first yeah yeah no
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
worries rick um and
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
and um i i was going to ask about that
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
too but i'll hold off on that one
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
um because i know that's one of the
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
things that that i think the governor
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
was talking about
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
specifically but but um i wanted to
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
ask you dr mckay about um other
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
sort of i don't want to call them sort
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
of accessory
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
you know issues that that that might
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
come up during
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
during um during a merger but things
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
like um
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
like you know system foundations and
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
what sort of considerations um have to
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
sort of be looked at um about those
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
types of things
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you just for the record i chair
 
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:22.069 align:start position:0%
thank you just for the record i chair
the

00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
foundation for new hampshire community
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
colleges and
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
several members of that board you met
 
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.550 align:start position:0%
several members of that board you met
yesterday

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
are appointed from the governing board
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
the board of trustees of the community
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
college system now
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
if there is no longer a governing board
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
what what are the impact
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
in my personal view is because there has
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
not been a history
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
of advancement and development in the
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely essential that that
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
that function that is development a
 
00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.750 align:start position:0%
that function that is development a
system-wide

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
system-wide
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
foundation for the community college be
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
in place because
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh i don't believe another entity uh
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
unh or could could serve those needs and
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
the amount of time that's spent with the
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
advisory committees on the different
 
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.470 align:start position:0%
advisory committees on the different
campuses

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
campuses
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
on the community college campuses going
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
there me
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
and trying to build an expectation for
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
development and support it is critical
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
so those are
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
the kind of the issues
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh the unintended consequences i think
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
that could result
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
from a rush to merger
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
okay thanks so there are there other
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
things that would sort of fall into
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
that category of i
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
well i i um the law school at unh has
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
its own you know
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
advisor unh manchester i think there are
 
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.190 align:start position:0%
advisor unh manchester i think there are
other

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
entities that have different
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
relationships and different
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
um appointments coming from the
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
governing board
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
i have not seen the most recent list of
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
that so i might i
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't state that because i'm not
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
that familiar with the current
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
but i there are relationships there and
 
00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.990 align:start position:0%
but i there are relationships there and
again

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
being built with the local communities
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
that host these campuses and their
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
businesses and
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
um i just if you look at what the
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
i'll pick on the community colleges
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
again what they've done in terms of
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
relationship with local businesses and
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
securing support for students during
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
cove at 19 time
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
and and responding to specific training
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
and credentialing
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be helpful to as
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
these businesses re-emerge
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's moral i will that attention still
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
be paid if there was only one
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
entity i i don't know that's a
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
question okay great no thanks thanks
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
very much ed
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
i i've got a question regarding i know
 
00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.589 align:start position:0%
i i've got a question regarding i know
that

00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
there are um
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
labor contracts at keene state
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
at unh at uh at the
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
community college uh what's your
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
experience and how those uh
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements are
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
i think there is likely to be impact
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
down the road as you i
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
believe is something like 10 or 11
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
different union agreements between the
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
two systems
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
um and it's hard for me to imagine that
 
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.270 align:start position:0%
um and it's hard for me to imagine that
as

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
if you're representing a group of
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
employees at x you don't look at
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
what's the provisions for benefits at
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
why and saying
 
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
well if those are better than what we
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
have shouldn't we be
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
equalized under a single system
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
so i do think again that may be one of
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
those unintended consequences that
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
um that will result as a
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
yeah that's going to be a very difficult
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
one with the compensation and terms and
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
conditions of various contracts
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
and it i can't help but think it's going
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
to end up with having some more costs
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
to try to equalize that out or try to
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
come to a if we're going to go that
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
direction towards some kind of a single
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
contract for certain groups
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
well and then the other it's also uh
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
complex because you've got different
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
international unions representing
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
various different
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
different contracts so it's not like
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
you've got one universal representative
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
throughout the system so
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
you've got those entities would have to
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
be dealt with from
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative ford
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
more than just that problem which i
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
don't think is an impossible problem
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
it's just simply
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
having to go through the process being a
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
former union president myself
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
it is just you're going to have to sit
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
down and negotiate all those
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
the more difficult thing in making
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
equations with people have
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
who have apparent equal status if you
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
will as a professor
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
is that they don't have equal status in
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
the marketplace
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
right and so now you're getting people
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
who are in high demand in industry
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
wanting to be paid more than someone who
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
just teaches
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
that subject quote unquote and so
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
you get into all of those kinds of
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
rather nasty
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
internacing kind of fights and they are
 
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.589 align:start position:0%
internacing kind of fights and they are
nasty

00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
nasty
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
i know i've i've lived through a couple
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
of them so
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
for our uh representative how long does
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
it take to get resolution on these
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
okay but you do
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
finally reach a working agreement
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
because you don't have any choice
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
and they don't have any choice we've all
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
got to work together
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
somehow and so you sort of hammer out
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
but you have to do it they're almost all
 
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.589 align:start position:0%
but you have to do it they're almost all
individual

00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
yeah the one thing i'd say with my
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
experience with the university system
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
and it may be an issue here is that when
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
the university system was created
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
employees at keene and plymouth were
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
part of the state
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
union and so it took which is a defined
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
benefit program not a defined
 
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.069 align:start position:0%
benefit program not a defined
contribution

00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
so it took there was a phase-out program
 
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.349 align:start position:0%
so it took there was a phase-out program
and

00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
and eventually all employees in the
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
university became part of
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
our 403 b which is a defined
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
contribution program
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
but i think a similar issue would exist
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
here is that a number of individuals in
 
00:43:29.119 --> 00:43:29.750 align:start position:0%
here is that a number of individuals in
the

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
community college system are part of the
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
state pension program to be able to find
 
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.230 align:start position:0%
state pension program to be able to find
benefit

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
um which makes it more problematic
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
to negotiate a resolution on that
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
embedded benefits and the time uh that
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
one may have in that particular program
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
but i agree with you it's possible and i
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
also agree with you the
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
faculty salaries for business faculty
 
00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:54.710 align:start position:0%
faculty salaries for business faculty
versus

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
um a question for you ed um
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
some people equate this and i've
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned i think in the committee
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
several times
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
it's like marching down the football
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
field on your 50-yard line you want to
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
get to the end zone with a hail mary
 
00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.710 align:start position:0%
get to the end zone with a hail mary
pass

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
rather than going incrementally down the
 
00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.069 align:start position:0%
rather than going incrementally down the
field

00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
field
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
and looking at our four-year system
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
granite state plymouth keene unh
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
have to the best of your knowledge have
 
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.510 align:start position:0%
have to the best of your knowledge have
we

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
had any kind of an effort to move
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
forward in merging
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
those systems into a system whereas
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
a course title in one situation in keene
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
is the same title in another
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
plymouth state and you get the same
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
three credits
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
and they're transferable between
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
departments it i understand maine is
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
trying to work through something like
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
this right now they have
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
all those satellites they expanded in
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
the 70s and 80s
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
to augusta to lewiston to presque isle
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
to carry you know all over
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
and now they're finding they can't
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
afford to keep those locations afloat
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
so this transferability of credit is
 
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
really important do we merge that first
 
00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.069 align:start position:0%
really important do we merge that first
amongst

00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
amongst
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
one level and then try to go
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
to the larger scope of structure and
 
00:45:21.359 --> 00:45:22.790 align:start position:0%
to the larger scope of structure and
organization

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good question i think
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
that would be a question to the
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
synergies group how to approach
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of that there has been adoption of
 
00:45:31.359 --> 00:45:33.270 align:start position:0%
a lot of that there has been adoption of
a

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
common learning management system but i
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
think in terms of the actual titling
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
and and you also find there's variances
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
now there's
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
three credit courses uh like kane and
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
other places for credit and
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
unh and so forth so part of it is
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
there's a number of things to
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
to resolve with that and i think if if
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
that is a specific concern
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
with regard to students transferring and
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
i don't uh know that it hasn't been
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
addressed to a great extent then um it
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
to create creation of a common student
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
information system
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
across both systems
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
is would be a very big project and would
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
cost a lot of money
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
so i i i think that and take time
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
um so i think that is the kind of
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
question that could be posed
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
and um would take some research
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
and and then you'd have more information
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
to the deal to
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
help you to define what the best path
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
forward is
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative ford yes dr mckay
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
when i was at lowell where i was not the
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
president by the way i was the assistant
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
to the president
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
but i was the president at southwest
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
minnesota state
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
okay just to clarify my my
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
bio here but we ran in when we were
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
merged with the community colleges
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
we ran into a situation in which our
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
introductory math course for example
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
had was being taught at the community
 
00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.630 align:start position:0%
had was being taught at the community
college

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
and you looked at the course description
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
and their
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
course description was exactly one
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
third of what we described in our course
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
that we taught and so we finally had to
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
have said
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to go by the competency
 
00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.150 align:start position:0%
we're going to go by the competency
achieved

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
achieved
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
in the course we'll give you the credits
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
as free electives
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
right we're going to go by fulfilling
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
requirements based on
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
what you did in the course and that
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
proved to be
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
pretty reasonably acceptable yeah
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative ford raises a good issue
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
and that is what are the learning
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
outcomes i know you have
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
an individual who really has expertise
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
coming to a future
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
in this arena with regard to
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
accreditation learning outcomes and so
 
00:47:47.839 --> 00:47:48.710 align:start position:0%
accreditation learning outcomes and so
forth

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
coming to a future meeting and that
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
would be a good conversation to have
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
with her
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
um but you're absolutely right there are
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
learning outcomes for specific programs
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
and institutions and if you're accepting
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
transfer and what were the learning
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
outcomes from those particular courses
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
um and how do they mesh them with the
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
program requirements at your
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
host institution so yes those are
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
that that's why there are um it's
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
difficult to find simple answers to a
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
lot of these transfer issues unless you
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
do a
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
pipe two plus two problem which do exist
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of places but you know
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
associate degree and accepting that
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
package and
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
that's that's helpful but if you're
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
talking about individual courses
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
or taking three courses here and one
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
course here
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of challenges in that
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
because again
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
the institution needs to protect its
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
integrity with regard to awarding
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately awarding of its degrees and
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
making sure its learning outcomes
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
are met for individuals who they're
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
granting their agree to so
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
as you suggested that analysis needs to
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
be done
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i can i do a follow-up on that one
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
rick sure go for it dave
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
so so thanks and oliver that was a that
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
was an excellent question and um
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
and i think you know dr mckay's response
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
on that i've i've
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
i've served um i think 20 plus years
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
on the unh engineering technology
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
program board
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
and on the nhti advisory board
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
and so there's always been a very very
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
close relationship
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
in a two plus two program where students
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
in engineering technology at the
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
have a seamless um
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
transfer into the into unh
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
and uh uh when i began on it it was unh
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
at durham it's now unh in manchester
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
but it's been a very very successful
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
program but
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
it wasn't at all easy to make sure
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
that that students particularly in the
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
math courses
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
had what they need coming out of high
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
school getting into
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
you know going to nhti for example and
 
00:49:56.319 --> 00:49:57.510 align:start position:0%
you know going to nhti for example and
then

00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
transferring into um into the
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
engineering technology program
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
at unh and so so even for
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
one very well established program it
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
required a tremendous amount of effort
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
on the part of you know essentially
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
faculty to um
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
to to make that um um make that happen
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
and and i guess you know uh one it
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like one of the concerns would be
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
um you know how do you go about
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
um making that happen on a broader basis
 
00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:34.069 align:start position:0%
um making that happen on a broader basis
um

00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
and and i i i don't know if that would
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
be easier under one system or
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
or or what
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
so yeah i based on the n champs report
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure would be easier under one
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
system i think that's one of the things
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
they cite is
 
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
the expectation was it was going to be
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
easier but when you get down to the
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty if you will
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's just as you suggest you have to
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
look at those learning outcomes and
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
align those so the individual
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
earning the degree has met those
 
00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.790 align:start position:0%
earning the degree has met those
expectations

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
expectations
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah no thank thanks very much dr
 
00:51:11.599 --> 00:51:12.390 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah no thank thanks very much dr
mccann

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
mccann
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
yeah you have a question art yes i do
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
please thank you rick
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
uh and you may not know this one because
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
it gets down into the weeds i understand
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
some of the issues between transferring
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
credits from the community college
 
00:51:24.079 --> 00:51:24.549 align:start position:0%
credits from the community college
system

00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
up into the college university system
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
and i this question is probably for
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
somebody at the community college system
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
is there sort of are there differences
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
between courses
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
and credits from the individual
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
community college campuses for instance
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
on math 101
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
is math 101 pretty much the same across
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
at the community college i
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
it is a question that would be better
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
addressed to uh chancellor hubert
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
um but based on my prior conversations
 
00:51:57.119 --> 00:51:57.910 align:start position:0%
um but based on my prior conversations
with

00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
chancellor cattell i know that enormous
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
amount of work was being done across the
 
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.349 align:start position:0%
amount of work was being done across the
system

00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
to um equalize those or to make
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
to resolve those kind of issues so i
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
don't want to say definitively that
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
many of those issues have been addressed
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
but i know they were being addressed and
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
but whether they're resolved or not i
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
just don't know
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you just just to follow up to what
 
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.030 align:start position:0%
thank you just just to follow up to what
where

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
art's coming from and and i've heard
 
00:52:23.599 --> 00:52:24.150 align:start position:0%
art's coming from and and i've heard
others

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
speaking the same way here um we've
 
00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.270 align:start position:0%
speaking the same way here um we've
heard

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
from beth dorian over at the community
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
college system
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
at a high percentage of of students
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
leaving high school that are coming into
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
the community college
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
they as well as adults uh are not
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
prepared for mathematics
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
yeah and they we at times have had as
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
high as 60 percent
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
of those incoming uh individuals
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
require remedial mathematics when i've
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
talked before to several college
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
presidents of our four years i don't
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
want to mention names of those
 
00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.150 align:start position:0%
want to mention names of those
presidents

00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
presidents
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
they've indicated to us on the committee
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
that they don't have remediation at the
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
four-year level
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
we we have it at the two-year level but
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
of that sixty percent that
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
come in fifty percent never come out
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
with a degree
 
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
um i'm fearful that if we lose
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
this uh access that we have through the
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
that we're going to lose a number of
 
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.230 align:start position:0%
that we're going to lose a number of
students

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
that i have hopes of getting a degree in
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
a higher level of education
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
would this program in your perspective
 
00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:33.829 align:start position:0%
would this program in your perspective
ed

00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
ed
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
be somewhat lost if we start emerging
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh everything our academic program our
 
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.349 align:start position:0%
uh everything our academic program our
accreditation

00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
accreditation
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
um of the various two years and four
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
years into one accreditation
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
if that's the route we go um or we can
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
lose something
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
well if if you go that route one
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
accreditation that's a
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
very big jump and especially if you
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
would combine two-year institutions and
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
four-year institutions uh
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
the university of maine system is just
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
looking at all their four-year
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
institutions and the unified
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
accreditation and again that's a good
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
question for one of your
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
future yes but let me say and i want to
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
applaud the work that the community
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
college system has done in
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
embracing what they call complete
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
college america initiatives and that
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
in in not having
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
students take these remedial courses
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
that don't count
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
for credit uh towards a degree but what
 
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.190 align:start position:0%
for credit uh towards a degree but what
they

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
have done is expanded them so the
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
remedial plus if you will
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
and they they have extra time and that
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
they convert those
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
into courses that then by measuring the
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
learning outcomes again
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
they can count towards satisfying degree
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
requirements for the two-year degree and
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
then if there's a two plus two
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
transfer so it really is helping so many
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
of those students who may come
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
to the community colleges not fully
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
prepared to
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
succeed and that's one of the critical
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
aspects of the community college again
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
being able to work
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
and with those students and provide more
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
attention and hands-on support maybe
 
00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:05.990 align:start position:0%
attention and hands-on support maybe
then

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
would reside otherwise and again some of
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
the initiatives that have been embraced
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
by the community college system
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
have i think been very effective at um
 
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.470 align:start position:0%
have i think been very effective at um
elevating

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
elevating
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
students so that they are prepared to
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
succeed at post-secondary education
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
dave yeah thanks thanks rick so um
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
ed something that's that's come up um
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
certainly it's come up at nhti but i
 
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
think it's probably come up at other
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
community colleges too
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
where where there is a um
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
a unique opportunity to to
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
possibly provide a baccalaureate degree
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
at the community community college level
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
in a
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
um in a in a course or in a
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
sorry in a program of studies that isn't
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
offered let's say
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
you know it through the university
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
system and
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
and i was uh i guess i was wondering is
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
is that something that um that
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
could could have been improved you know
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
improve the um the uh
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
degree attainment potential for
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
students under the existing separate
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
systems or
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
or under under a combined system
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i again i'll
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
express my personal
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
bias here i would rather in those
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
circumstances where there's
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
identification for a need of a
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
bachelor's program
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
with um then i would
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
prefer uh collaboration with the
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
university system one of the
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
institutions that's best aligned
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
to serve that need and to partner with
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
that including the potential delivery on
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
the nhdi campus
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
of that four full years because as you
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
all know
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
many of those individuals may be place
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
bound and not able to
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
travel to plymouth or wherever to
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
complete a degree so
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
i i think again this is the kind of
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
collaboration i think that they're
 
00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:10.230 align:start position:0%
collaboration i think that they're
seeking

00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
seeking
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
through the synergies group and other
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
initiatives and i i'm optimistic about
 
00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:15.510 align:start position:0%
initiatives and i i'm optimistic about
those

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh producing those kinds of results and
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
whether that happens um under a merger
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
or not i don't know
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
okay in the past
 
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
ed i've talked with todd and asked him
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
the question should the community
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
college system be
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
issuing a four-year degree and of course
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
he was objecting to that but i talked to
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
roscatel and they've oftentimes come
 
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
before the education committee saying
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
well they'd like to have some programs
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
which can
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
engage you know a four-year certificate
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
would you see this happening
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh with a merger
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's a necessary
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
outcome and again my bias is to
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
have each of the systems ideally
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
maintain their
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
distinctive features and focus i also
 
00:58:05.599 --> 00:58:06.390 align:start position:0%
distinctive features and focus i also
think

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
it begins to blur that line about
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
compensation for faculty going back
 
00:58:10.079 --> 00:58:10.630 align:start position:0%
compensation for faculty going back
there

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
and it it again may create unintended
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
consequences and
 
00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
challenges down the road if you start to
 
00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:19.990 align:start position:0%
challenges down the road if you start to
initiate

00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
initiate
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
the deliver the awarding of four-year
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
degrees on the community college
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
campuses um so
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
i i think there are issues embedded in
 
00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:30.390 align:start position:0%
i i think there are issues embedded in
that

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
now well along that along that same line
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
the one of the things that was cited um
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
by the governor
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
was the competition for students
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
with a diminishing number of
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
students in school and graduating et
 
00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.510 align:start position:0%
students in school and graduating et
cetera

00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
cetera
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
is the competition of how do you attract
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
students to to come and one of the one
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
of the points you make in your
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
presentation is the uh the the unh
 
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.190 align:start position:0%
presentation is the uh the the unh
system

00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
helps to get people from out of state to
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
come into the state
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
but uh how do you look at the issue of
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
the question of
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
a student competing to get students
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh on campus i
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
i think that's an excellent question and
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
i think that some of the
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
the dual admission programs that grants
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
um great bay
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
community college as with unh i think
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
more initiatives like that so
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
you can so the university system the
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
community college system could market
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
and communicate to new hampshire high
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
school students
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
here's a pathway for you here's a lower
 
00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
cost pathway for your first two years at
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
community college you may where you may
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
be able to commute to
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
it and then you all your credits are
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
transferred in the 2 program
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
and that you're able to complete that
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
degree with relatively low levels
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
of student debt and and again
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
financial aid is you know particularly
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
important here in providing that aid
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
we've mentioned that i've mentioned
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
before the granite can guarantee
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
i think there are ways to
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
market the this capacity to earn four
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
two and four-year degrees at a a lower
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
price tag which
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
makes collectively the public systems in
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
more competitive without out-of-state
 
01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.430 align:start position:0%
more competitive without out-of-state
offerings

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
offerings
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
um i think that's exactly the kind of
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
initiative that should be embraced and i
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
think is being embraced but we've seen
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
some examples of it but expanded
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
um and i think it would be very helpful
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
to say i i share those concerns as many
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
of you know i've been involved in what
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
they've called 65 by 25 for a number of
 
01:00:42.079 --> 01:00:42.630 align:start position:0%
they've called 65 by 25 for a number of
years

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
so i am concerned about our future
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
workforce needs
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
but but with that said the merger
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
this could happen even without any kind
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
of a merger then
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely it does exist yeah right
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
exactly just you just need to ramp it up
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
it's what you're saying you just wrap
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
up the opportunity ramp it up and and
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
maybe special
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
support from our like like
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative led secured uh
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
state support for dual and current
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment in stem courses
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
now that is an important initiative to
 
01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
have students
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
earn college level or credit
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
for stem courses before going on maybe
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's a special
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
support appropriation for marketing of
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
this these pathways that
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
let them identify the pathways whatever
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
i i do agree it's an issue and we need
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
to work on it
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
ed can you talk a little bit about
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
granite guarantee
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
where does the funding come from for
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
granted guarantee i thought that was
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
only for a four-year school
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it is only offered by the
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
residential campuses within the
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
university system in new hampshire i
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear about that
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
but what they did what the university
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
system did two years ago i believe
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
they said if you're a graduate of the
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
community college system and you meet
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
the criteria which is your pedal
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
eligible and you're going full time
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
and you then we will extend that to you
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
and basically what it says it provides
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
last dollar support such that there's no
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
net cost for tuition
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
so if you're pell eligible and you've
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
got two or three
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
whatever the the let's say it's ten
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar or eleven thousand
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
dollars for tuition of
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
plymouth whatever the current figure
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
maybe thirteen thousand let's say
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
thirteen thousand and your your um pell
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
grant is four thousand um through other
 
01:02:26.559 --> 01:02:27.430 align:start position:0%
grant is four thousand um through other
packages

01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
packages
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh including the unique endowment payout
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
and others that institutional aid
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
the institution will commit to so that
 
01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.349 align:start position:0%
the institution will commit to so that
you

01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
um your full need is met for tuition it
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover room and board
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
but that's an important marketing piece
 
01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:42.470 align:start position:0%
but that's an important marketing piece
and

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:44.310 align:start position:0%
again i'm hopeful that those kinds of
 
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:45.430 align:start position:0%
again i'm hopeful that those kinds of
[Music]

01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities can be expanded
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
enough but you're right it only goes to
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
the three residential
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh universities and camps now so so ed
 
01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
where is the revenue come from
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
for this for the the university to have
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
these funds to help a kid would grant it
 
01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.829 align:start position:0%
these funds to help a kid would grant it
guarantee

01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
guarantee
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
is it out of the the the assets that the
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
four years have that the community
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
college does not have
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
yes that's that's true um sorry my
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
phone's ringing in the background but
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
yes i um just
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
the um yes the the university system
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh awards a great deal of financial aid
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
to both in-state and out-of-state
 
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
students and
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
in prioritizing this initiative they
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
looked at the
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
assets they had including again the
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
payoff from the unique endowment and
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
others uh sources other grants and gifts
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
that have been
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
you know to provide scholarship funds
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
and that and they've awarded those so
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
let me just again so yes
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
thank you uh alvar
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i have
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
advocated for years now with students
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
that the easiest way to reduce the cost
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
of education
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
is to not interrupt it with summers
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
simply go straight through
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
and you can get out in two and a half
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
years with a bachelor's degree
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
that be something that with community
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
colleges in concert and so forth
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
it might be possible to get more people
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
to think in those terms
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
i absolutely absolutely agree and i
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
think that's a wonderful idea
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
and let me go back though the fact that
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
some high school students are earning
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
significant number of college credits
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
now through the various community
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
college initiatives in fact
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
i i just saw yesterday a preview of what
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
will be announced soon
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
an student graduating from high school
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
um will earn her associate's degree
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
several months after
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
graduating from high school so that is
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
exactly the kind of thing we're trying
 
01:04:50.799 --> 01:04:51.510 align:start position:0%
exactly the kind of thing we're trying
to

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
is everybody is anybody able to hear ed
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
i apologize i have some uh
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
internet connection issues here so um
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure but i i'm embracing uh
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
the notion
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
and cited the fact that uh again we we
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
have an example of a student
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
who um i've been having a problem two
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so i i
 
01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
a student who would graduate high school
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
and regret earning associate degrees
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
soon thereafter so
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
um i think that is the kind of thing we
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
in vermont i'm sorry i didn't
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
hear that question i'm sorry i i just i
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
was going to confirm
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
what you said about vermont earlier i
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
was on a castleton's
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
knee ask visit and therefore their
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
foreign students i.e from new york just
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
quit coming after a while they would
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
come there for two years
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
and ski and then they would go back home
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
and get their degree from a local place
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and eventually that just quit
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
happening and it was
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
very bad on them for enrollments yeah
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh ed when you were a chancellor for the
 
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
university system
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
and you must have been seeing some of
 
01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:42.470 align:start position:0%
and you must have been seeing some of
the

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
departments within the university system
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh at various college location
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
university locations
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
which were being funded through revenues
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
via other departments in other words the
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
student attendance in these programs was
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
is shrinking sort of like our
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
law school now in the center part of the
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
state here
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
um are there any programs that you know
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
that need consolidation
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
or maybe it's time to say that maybe
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
we'll have that done through reciprocity
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
with another state school in another
 
01:07:19.039 --> 01:07:19.829 align:start position:0%
with another state school in another
state

01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
like maine has their physical therapy
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
kids coming to unh
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
maine doesn't have such a program is
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
there room for us to try
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
to have a little bit more reciprocity
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
and work agreements with some of these
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
other state universities
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
well yes and in fact the the vehicle
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
exists for that and that's the new
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
england board of higher education or
 
01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:43.589 align:start position:0%
england board of higher education or
nebby

01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
nebby
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
nebby has this regional tuition program
 
01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
where if a program is not offered in
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
your state
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
you can get the in-state rate to
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
participate in that program
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
in that state for example there's no
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
pharmacy program in the state of new
 
01:07:59.829 --> 01:07:59.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire so new hampshire
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
students can go to rhode island to go
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
for their their
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
pharmacy program the nebby program has
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
been established for 20-some years
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
and is a viable vehicle for
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
allowing students those opportunities
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
we wanted to attract a lot of out of
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
state students and so we
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire residential campuses so
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
that we had the
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
capacity to offer as many programs that
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
we thought
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
met the state needs but if you're as we
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
look collectively the demographics
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
across new england you may see
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
rick i'm gonna have to drop now okay
 
01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:43.749 align:start position:0%
rick i'm gonna have to drop now okay
dave

01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
dave
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
but but i want to thank you very much
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%

it's great to see you this morning and
 
01:08:49.679 --> 01:08:50.149 align:start position:0%
it's great to see you this morning and
um

01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%

01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
and we'll we'll see you back on uh on
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
this real soon
 
01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
so everyone have a great weekend all
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much dave good luck
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
um alumni associations ed are extremely
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
important and alumni associations at unh
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
are probably
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
i i'm just making a guess are much
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
stronger than they are at nhti
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
um nhgi does a good job by the way with
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
30. so let me say of
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
of all the uh community colleges they
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
may be have the strongest
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
i think they do have the strongest
 
01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.829 align:start position:0%
i think they do have the strongest
association

01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
do alumni associations and of course
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
this is our perception or
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
you know more of a a guess
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
would if they see that their university
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
is going to come underneath the roof
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
of a larger global structure system
 
01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:51.189 align:start position:0%
of a larger global structure system
structure

01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
do you think there would be a chance
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
that you would see
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
fewer gifts in terms of finances going
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
to that institution or
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
alumni contributions are very important
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
to unh
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
yes i i um
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
i don't see that much having much impact
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
on you and age because
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's really distinct but let me say i
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
think pennsylvania is looking at some of
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
those issues
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
now consolidating in two different cases
 
01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.550 align:start position:0%
now consolidating in two different cases
three

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
campuses into one i
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
i think most donors identification
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
is with particular institution not with
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
a system
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
so what we have found over the years
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
is that while you want to support
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
um collective fundraising by backroom
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
operations such as the foundation for
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire community colleges
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
does and the v the
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
asking primarily if not almost
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
exclusively but primarily has to come
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
from the particular
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
institution that has the affiliation
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
that individual or that association and
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
individuals do give back to institutions
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
yes there are some gifts received at a
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
system level
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
and they're very appreciated but i have
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
to say the great majority i think that
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
if there was some blending of brand and
 
01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.950 align:start position:0%
if there was some blending of brand and
identification

01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
identification
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
um then i think there's a potential to
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
lose some
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
some aspect of giving you mentioned
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
the pennsylvania higher education system
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting system they have
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
the commonwealth
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh system of higher education which
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
involves 14 different institutions
 
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
however one of those
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
institutions penn state has 23 units
 
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:44.390 align:start position:0%
institutions penn state has 23 units
within

01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
it and so they have a separate uh system
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
called the penn state
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
higher education system
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
and within their system i always thought
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
temple university was
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
a private in philadelphia but that's
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
part of the commonwealth system
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
so does the university of pittsburgh
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
university of pittsburgh temple
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and and penn state essentially
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
functions independently then they have a
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
state university system as you said with
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
14 institutions and that's
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
where two pairs of three um those three
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
institutions can be combined in one case
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
three others and in other kings
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
yeah very different model that uh
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
that works uh of course that might be a
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
question for don burks too because he
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
was a chancellor within that system
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
i'll wait and hold that one okay
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of uh ed
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
right now he's been with us now for
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
an hour and 15 or 20 minutes it's quite
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
a lengthy period
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
um representative ellison may have a
 
01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.070 align:start position:0%
um representative ellison may have a
question

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
yes art
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's better thank you going back to
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
the math question
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty familiar with how the
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
community college system has
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
made those changes to with students who
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
come in without
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
the need in math skills and i applaud
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
them for that because by putting those
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
into the credit situation
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
then students are not pulling off their
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
pell grant money without getting any
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
any credits given that situation and i
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
just want to be a little clear
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
how does unh or plymouth or keene handle
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
that if the same student comes in
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
who is has some limited math
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
do you have some sense of that no i as
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
representative lad said earlier the
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
position of the university system has
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
been historically and
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
um i admit i don't have real current
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
information but
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
their their position was there were no
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
remedial courses there
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
and that uh students sought
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
support from from the faculty members or
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
maybe from other students to help them
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
through that i think that
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
was more challenging for them okay
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you that's helpful thank you uh i
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
have one last question i've been sort of
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
holding off on it
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh for you ed it deals with the new
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
governing board and you spoke about this
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
at the very beginning
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
and when i look at the community college
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
system now they're
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
very closely aligned with regional
 
01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.510 align:start position:0%
very closely aligned with regional
business

01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
when i look at the university system new
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire and that board of trustees
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
i i see a number of folks which are are
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
government related various departments
 
01:14:33.199 --> 01:14:35.030 align:start position:0%
government related various departments
um

01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
represented from the house and the
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
senate by way
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the president and the speaker
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
you have folks from the various
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture the
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
on all the departments it's it's a much
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
different makeup
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
of a board than you have at the
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
community college level
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
and you spoke about the new board being
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
politically appointed um does that
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
and our are what you trying to say is
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
that by
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
we might be missing that element of
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
tying our education to
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh current changing needs of our
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
business community
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
by not having business oriented people
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
on on
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
on the overarching board well i and i
 
01:15:17.199 --> 01:15:18.149 align:start position:0%
on the overarching board well i and i
think

01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
i think that is a concern um
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
again one of the individuals i know that
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to have soon
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
has just written a paper
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
or a publication for the association of
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
governing boards which
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
talks about the composition
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
and the challenges to governing boards
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
now and do they have the individuals in
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
that board
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
with the right set of experiences and
 
01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.229 align:start position:0%
with the right set of experiences and
skills

01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
skills
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
and perspectives to enable
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
that respective board institution to
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
move forward in a strategic
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
manner so it's unclear from me
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
unclear to me given the appointment
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
process that's embedded
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2 how there'll be
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
assurances that
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
all those perspectives in terms of the
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
local state and regional economic needs
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
and different
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
needs are going to be addressed in that
 
01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:14.630 align:start position:0%
needs are going to be addressed in that
composition

01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
composition
 
01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:16.270 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:18.149 align:start position:0%
there's no
[Music]

01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
no assurance of that at this point
 
01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:24.110 align:start position:0%
may be the intent but again
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:25.189 align:start position:0%
may be the intent but again
[Music]

01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's not possible to infer that based on
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
the information that's currently
 
01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.630 align:start position:0%
the information that's currently
available

01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any more questions
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
for ed at this time
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
yes fraps and milor uh thank you rick
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
one of the questions i have you know you
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
have the unh
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
at least uh its brand is this what is
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
the leading in
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
in research institution in the in the
 
01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:49.669 align:start position:0%
in research institution in the in the
state

01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
how does that brand then relate
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
to the vision of the community college
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
which is different than that brand how
 
01:16:59.040 --> 01:16:59.669 align:start position:0%
which is different than that brand how
do

01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
how do you see the merging of those two
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
different visions coming together
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
i i think they the branding would have
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
to under any scenario must
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
remain distinct i think the
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
unh appropriately brands itself as a
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
a carnegie one research institution
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
um attracts students from across the
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
country and
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
internationally and um again
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
with its land-grant sea grant space
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
grant designations
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
offers the opportunity for students to
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
do high
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
end research and though again
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
that experience is different than what
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
may appeal to other
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
individuals and whatever happens
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
has to ensure that those uh institutions
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
whatever their respective
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
mission is are able to continue to
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
market that
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
if it's blurred in any way that will
 
01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.590 align:start position:0%
if it's blurred in any way that will
potentially

01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
put it at risk their ability to
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
successfully continue
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh ed i'm looking at some of the
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
structures that connecticut has
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
with their their uh academic of the
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
connecticut board of regents for higher
 
01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:18.709 align:start position:0%
connecticut board of regents for higher
education

01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
they have both financial and academic
 
01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.950 align:start position:0%
they have both financial and academic
authority

01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any familiarity with
 
01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.310 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any familiarity with
connecticut

01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of do they still have their
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
boards for the community college
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
and the university system below this
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
they may have advisory boards for those
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
different campuses
 
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
i do not believe they have any governing
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
boards any longer but i'm not sure
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
and of course you know uconn is not part
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
that system so it's just the former
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
state universities colleges and the
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
community college that were put into
 
01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:54.709 align:start position:0%
community college that were put into
that

01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
that that board um i think again susan
 
01:18:58.560 --> 01:18:59.270 align:start position:0%
that that board um i think again susan
hughes

01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
hughes
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
or others that have had experience in
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
that system
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
um would be better able to tell you
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
about some of their experiences
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
okay going through that process which
 
01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
has been challenging
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
so uconn is a stand-alone university
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
that's correct and receives separate
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation funding separate board of
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
trustees etc
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you okay um
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
well we are we're not uh 11
 
01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
20 here um are there any more questions
 
01:19:32.239 --> 01:19:32.950 align:start position:0%
20 here um are there any more questions
for

01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%

01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%

very much appreciate the work you do
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature establishes the policy
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
for the executive branch to put him
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
implement and i know
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
i it's in good hands whatever this
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
decision may be i have faith and

[Music]
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
what we have coming up and and i'll i'll
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
try to make sure did
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
did everybody get there was a report
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
that was put out that
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
mike moffitt asked for from the
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
education commission of the states
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh did did you receive that one
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
he he asked the question and they
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
responded you were inquired about state
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
examples of post-secondary system
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
mergers including those
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
which created a single statewide
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
governance structure
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
and they responded with a a brief which
 
01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:47.669 align:start position:0%
and they responded with a a brief which
was

01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh four pages long or a little longer
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
i got it i i okay it came through to me
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
okay good uh because at the latter part
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
of that there
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
there were some uh they compared to some
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
and i thought the their their summary
 
01:21:09.679 --> 01:21:10.070 align:start position:0%
and i thought the their their summary
are

01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
there's a a section there on page three
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
of that report
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
which gave an overview of post-secondary
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
institutional mergers with some of the
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
key questions which need to be resolved
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's something we want to might look
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
at in terms of
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
questions that we might be asking the
 
01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.629 align:start position:0%
questions that we might be asking the
practitioners

01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
which are going to be with us on
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
wednesday the practitioners are those
 
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
that have been presidents of
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
of university colleges and that and one
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
of those practitioners will
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
is also the chancellor for the community
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
college system
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
today the other practitioner is don
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
burks who was a chancellor with the
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
penn state system uh out in
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
bay run that's the penn state university
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
in erie pennsylvania which is an
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
engineering school
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
and uh that there's some very
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
interesting questions that that
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
need to be answered regarding that
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
system because some of the differences
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
in courses that are
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
supposedly transferable are not accepted
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
they were done at a a school which
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
didn't come up with those types of
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
standards that
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
we have been talking about with ed mckay
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
so um and then we have barbara
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
brittenham coming up on
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
on friday and barbara is
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
one that's very familiar with the
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
crediting in fact she is
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
the individual with the old knee ass
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
program out of boston that is seen as
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
misaccrediting for the country she's
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
she's it
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
good that's good yeah rick rick
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
i've got a question for oliver allard
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
when you were when you were at lowell
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
did you say that you guys did go through
 
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
some kind of a consolidation
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh yeah in your experience when we were
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
there originally the
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
the first push was merging lowell tech
 
01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
and lowell state
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
into one university and then it got
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
caught up into
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
becoming part of umass lowell and then
 
01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
the state system and all of that
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
sort of tumbled one thing into another
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
so so the tech the tech program and this
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
college program then came together
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
in that merger with the with umass
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's how i became
 
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh an aft union president and when we
 
01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:29.910 align:start position:0%
uh an aft union president and when we
merged

01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
merged
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
we agreed to join nea if i was the
 
01:23:33.199 --> 01:23:34.229 align:start position:0%
we agreed to join nea if i was the
president

01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
president
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay and that's how we settled that
 
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
issue with the faculty
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
and then so i became an nea president
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
and then i became an ace fellow and went
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
into college administration
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right so how long did that
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
merger take place oliver
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
what was it uh done uh um over how many
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
years it wasn't wasn't all that long i
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
mean it happened fairly fast
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
i don't remember exactly because i was
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
away for part of it
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm the end of it how much it went but i
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
remember meeting
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
with the community colleges and haggling
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
out courses and things like that
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
and they got a new person in from
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
florida who was all
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
hot and bothered and wanting to push
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
ahead to community colleges
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any problem with that we
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
just wanted equatability
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
and so how did the how did these uh how
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
did the cbas
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
merge the collective bargaining uh what
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
was the only one
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
i was in any part of merging was the one
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
when the university merged
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
and we worked it out between us
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
and did the compensation uh was there a
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
leveling of the compensation or
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
and benefits item was not there for the
 
01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:48.709 align:start position:0%
and benefits item was not there for the
partner

01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
partner
 
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
outside like going to community colleges
 
01:24:54.149 --> 01:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
i was not there when when that because
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
their requirements for credentials
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
are different from the university so
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
you know you you're you're getting
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
someone with fewer credentials
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
so i wasn't there for that but i would
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
imagine it it
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
still they're still operating on a
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
and a university system so when you went
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
through all this
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
oliver was there when that was occurring
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
in working with the community college
 
01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.189 align:start position:0%
in working with the community college
system

01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
did the community college mission
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
become subordinate to that of the
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
baccalaureate degree programs
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i mean i i had never
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
no sense of that at all
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay because that's something i taught
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
at nj mass bay and i taught it
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
i i think that's a major concern that
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
folks are having
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
that you know we don't want to lose
 
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
sight of the certification programs that
 
01:25:54.159 --> 01:25:54.470 align:start position:0%
sight of the certification programs that
the

01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
community college is doing and those
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
two-year programs which are so necessary
 
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
for regional business
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i thought ed brown i
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
thought i thought ed
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
brought an important point and that's
 
01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:08.870 align:start position:0%
brought an important point and that's
the

01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
the role of the uh the the public
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
higher education um oversight committee
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
the study committee
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
and its role its potential role in this
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
thing which
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
has not been mentioned i i mean this is
 
01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
the first time he had mentioned it
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
and you and i uh rick had talked about
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
this before but
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this is a from a
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
statute standpoint
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
it is a governing process that needs to
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
be engaged in this thing i would think
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
yeah and for our our our committee
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
members here i'll give you the statutory
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
reference for that
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh because i i was looking at this
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
so 187 dash a
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
colon 28 and then there's dash a small a
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
and basically here's what it says in the
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
last part of that public education study
 
01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:10.950 align:start position:0%
last part of that public education study
committee

01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
there it says the study committee shall
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
be composed of eight members
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
and shall examine the goals purposes
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
organization and financing of public
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
higher education in new hampshire
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
and shall evaluate and make
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations on the university of new
 
01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:27.990 align:start position:0%
recommendations on the university of new
hampshire

01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
plymouth state university keene state
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
college granite state college
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
and the community college system of new
 
01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.990 align:start position:0%
and the community college system of new
hampshire

01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
so that that uh education study
 
01:27:38.719 --> 01:27:39.270 align:start position:0%
so that that uh education study
committee

01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
really has oversight over organization
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
and structure yeah it does yeah
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
by statute so so it seemed to be that
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
any kind of a study committee
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's looking at this merger would
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately have to make some
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation to that group that would
 
01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.310 align:start position:0%
recommendation to that group that would
then

01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
deal with whatever legislative changes
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
that need to take place
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
or if if this this committee chooses
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
not to engage i guess we're you know
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
defaulting on our obligation to
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
fulfill this duty that's been assigned
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
to us so uh
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
i i for one am going to be contacting
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
ruth ward
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
and because i'm assuming that she is the
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
chair of this commission
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
committee now uh seeing that she's the
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
chair of
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh senate education yeah also i also
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
need to check with the speaker because i
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
the the speaker is the one who basically
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
makes those appointments to go to that
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
study committee and i would assume
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
with the change of administration that
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
there may be a change
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
because remember to my surprise i
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
chaired that last year
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and and i would assume there's
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
going to be new people on that and
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
if that hasn't been appointed i would
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
assume that he should uh
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
move uh forth with that give me that
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's been done mel
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
oh it has okay good great okay so the
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
the k
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
the committee can go ahead but it got
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
him it has to be called by the senate
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
yeah right exactly yes ago there was a
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
time when
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
john reagan had it yeah and then um at
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
one point in time i believe i don't
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
think ruth
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
ruth was on that but she never was
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
cheering it i think she was on it during
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
your tenure yes correct yeah
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
and so and i can remember that when i
 
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
chaired it
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
reagan was on it and i think
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
alessandro was on it but
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's something that we got to
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
get on top of
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
i think also in we're going to be
 
01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:41.110 align:start position:0%
i think also in we're going to be
talking

01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
next week on wednesday with the two
 
01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:44.390 align:start position:0%
next week on wednesday with the two
individuals

01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
you know i've mentioned i'd be looking
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
at that report that comes out of the
 
01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
national center for
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
higher education management um systems
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
and those 10 questions on page 27 of
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
that report
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
very good are very very good questions
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
we need to discuss those questions
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
we also want to look at you know some of
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
the information
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
before that which they deal with these
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
different states that have gone through
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
some of this consolidation
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
um i i'd be you know
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
interested in and really looking at what
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
happened in minnesota and connecticut
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not too concerned what happened
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
alaska i'm familiar what happened there
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
and it's just a whole different ball
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
game than
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
tiny new hampshire it doesn't have the
 
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
geographic issues that
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
we have here um they also didn't really
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
have the demographic issues as well at
 
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
so is our role here rick uh as we
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
move forward on this in the next two
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
meetings is to come up with a series of
 
01:30:45.199 --> 01:30:46.470 align:start position:0%
meetings is to come up with a series of
questions

01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
for division two uh exactly what is
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative umberger uh looking
 
01:30:52.719 --> 01:30:53.270 align:start position:0%
uh representative umberger uh looking
for

01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
for our group to to give to her
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
yeah she's looking for basic information
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
and facts
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
and considerations so um
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of that today i'm
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
going to go back and listen to
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
streaming here and try to extract from
 
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:12.470 align:start position:0%
streaming here and try to extract from
that

01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
some of these particular issues that
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
need consideration we're not going to
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
have resolution today no
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
no and we it's impossible uh one of the
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
issues that's
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
popping up is timeline you know what's
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
the timeline for this transfer and what
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
are the associated costs
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
to go through a restructure there's
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
going to be some sideways
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
costs and that's what i've i've had that
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
indicated to me by both the
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
community college system and the
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
university system
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh i don't see that in the budget well i
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
i also
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
thought uh ed's comment regarding about
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
suspending the search process
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
um is a good one because frankly
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh if how are they going to get
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
candidates who are going to
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
who know that this is possible how are
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
they going to get good candidates if
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
they know this is possible knowing full
 
01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:07.430 align:start position:0%
they know this is possible knowing full
well

01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
that there may be a merger here it just
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
seems to me that that
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
we this needs to be resolved before
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
any finalization of the selection
 
01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.030 align:start position:0%
any finalization of the selection
process

01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
for the respective chancellors take
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
place i it's just
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
i think that what we could do is we
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
could also perhaps have
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh we could ask to have somebody from
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
the university system come in that might
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
have some answers to
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh because they're in the process of
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
chancellor right now so so is the
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
but i as i'm sure oliver here having
 
01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:43.669 align:start position:0%
but i as i'm sure oliver here having
been

01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
in this capacity before would want to
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
know what's the structure
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
what are going to be my obligations
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and duties here
 
01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
and that could certainly change
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
drastically with the
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
with a new organizational framework um
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
i can tell you right now rick you don't
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
want a
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
a system in which there's no one in
 
01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:06.629 align:start position:0%
a system in which there's no one in
charge

01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
charge
 
01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
and all the presidents report to the
 
01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:09.669 align:start position:0%
and all the presidents report to the
legislature

01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
or somebody some other dealing with
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
their own deal it just turns into a dog
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
fight well that's not what we have
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
exactly right now but we do not have
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
a strong chancellor ceo system
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
yes we saw what happened in in case of
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
keene state when they were
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
down with uh with their revenues and
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
and needed some help over there and todd
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
went over and basically
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
lived at keene state trying to help them
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
climb out
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
which melinda did a great job in doing
 
01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:47.270 align:start position:0%
which melinda did a great job in doing
that

01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
um so but the chancellor has to be
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
your boss it has to be the the one in
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
which the presidents
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
are underneath the chancellor in my
 
01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:57.910 align:start position:0%
are underneath the chancellor in my
perspective

01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe that's the way the
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
structure is set up right now
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
they're oliver is that is that your
 
01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:04.790 align:start position:0%
they're oliver is that is that your
point

01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much my point i can
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
remember when we got into competition
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
one of our branches got into competition
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
with a community college
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
who was giving a bachelor's degree in
 
01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:17.990 align:start position:0%
who was giving a bachelor's degree in
plumbing

01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
plumbing
 
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
and so that got sorted out by the
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
by the chancellor well you also you also
 
01:34:24.639 --> 01:34:25.030 align:start position:0%
by the chancellor well you also you also
have

01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
you not only have the the coursework
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
stuff but one of the concerns i've had
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
what's the coordination of of the
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh the building process of the the
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
capital improvement issues
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
i mean how do you determine within
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
particular institutions well
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
you can put that building here and you
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
can put that building there but we
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
wait a second we already have that
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
building over here so i mean
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
that we haven't even talked about the
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
capital improvement issues yet
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
and the fact is you have campuses that
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
you if you were starting from scratch
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
you might not create but they already
 
01:34:59.280 --> 01:34:59.990 align:start position:0%
you might not create but they already
exist

01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
exactly right now and so what do you do
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
with them
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
yeah and if you say the word closed in
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
anyone's hearing
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
you just it all just dissolves into
 
01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.270 align:start position:0%
you just it all just dissolves into
chaos

01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
chaos
 
01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right it's all there's a lot
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
of ownership
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
oh yeah rick i have i have a question
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
for you or oliver or anybody on the call
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
i've gone through we're going through
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
sort of the studies in the various
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
states and
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
raising questions and some some plans
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
are here and some are there do we
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
have any states that you're aware of
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
that have successfully merged those
 
01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:37.750 align:start position:0%
that have successfully merged those
systems

01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
that we can now say whatever
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
nebraska did a great job let's look at
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
that and see what
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
how they did it does anything come to
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
mind for picking out a state or states
 
01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
i i can't honestly tell you that because
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
this is not really my bailiwick but
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh i i i got to assume
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
that yes restructuring is occurring
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
throughout this country right now
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
simply because of dollar availability
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
shrinking demographic
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
increased competition for those limited
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
pool of
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
of students uh and we see that in
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
our small region of new england really
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
see it
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
look what happened to the law school
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
here at unh
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
they're under attack from law schools in
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
the boston area for the same
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
student our population at the law school
 
01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:33.830 align:start position:0%
student our population at the law school
was

01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
half of what it was several years ago
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
you have problems maintaining your
 
01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
professors and your
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
your instructors um you just don't have
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
the revenue so you have to borrow from
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
elsewhere within your university system
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
to maintain that school that can't
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
and that that but that goes back to the
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
question i had earlier
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
regarding the consolidation of certain
 
01:36:59.679 --> 01:37:00.870 align:start position:0%
regarding the consolidation of certain
programs

01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
um do we have we have we looked at that
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
and is that something that
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at i don't know
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
because because the community colleges
 
01:37:09.199 --> 01:37:10.310 align:start position:0%
because because the community colleges
frankly

01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
have done that i mean they have
 
01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.990 align:start position:0%
have done that i mean they have
diversified

01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
diversified
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
their programs to meet their respective
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
needs of their
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
their region so you know you don't have
 
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:20.790 align:start position:0%
their region so you know you don't have
a

01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
you don't have a a big engine program
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh down in nhti you've got that up in
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
the berlin area i mean so
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
they have i think they've done a pretty
 
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
good job of trying to diversify
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
their programs to meet the the
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
demographics of their particular
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
regional area
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
so i i think that when we when we meet
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
with don burks
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh next week on wednesday don was
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned before in the
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania system yeah and when i went
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
out there
 
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
and and uh met with the folks in erie
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania last summer
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
where my grandson was thinking of going
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
to school
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
that school he was at the strength of
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
that school was their
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
engineering program in plastics and
 
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:05.910 align:start position:0%
engineering program in plastics and
molding

01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
molding
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
and um that what they drew a lot of kids
 
01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:09.830 align:start position:0%
and um that what they drew a lot of kids
from

01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
university park to go up to erie uh
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
and that and of course that's within
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
penn state higher education system which
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
is underneath the commonwealth system
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's a system that seems to be
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
working and growing and that
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
is one that they had to go through and
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
retool that back in the 80s
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
so don might be able to help us out with
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
that type of question that art asked
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
are there any systems that have gone
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
through this i know
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
maine right now is looking at trying to
 
01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:42.709 align:start position:0%
maine right now is looking at trying to
restructure

01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
restructure
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
their four-year schools in terms of
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
credits and accreditation
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
and that's what barbara brittenham is
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
going to speak to
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
on on friday up next
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
and barbara's also familiar with some of
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
those other retoolings going on
 
01:38:59.590 --> 01:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in new england and so is susan
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
heward in terms of what happened in
 
01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.390 align:start position:0%
heward in terms of what happened in
connecticut

01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
and that's in the report right here that
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
we have in front of us
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
i thought it was interesting that ed
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
kind of i think he not only implied but
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
stated that
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
he didn't think that from a cost savings
 
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
stands point
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
that he didn't think that there would be
 
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
much cost savings
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
in the merging of it i mean there may be
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
some from a
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
from a policy standpoint from an
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
institutional standpoint there may be
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
some merits to bringing people to
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
bringing together but i don't think he i
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
don't think he was saying that
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
don't think that there's going to be any
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
cost savings going on here so
 
01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
i thought that was an interest
 
01:39:40.229 --> 01:39:40.239 align:start position:0%
interesting comment he mentioned that in
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
in that that uh email he sent us that
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
attachment he mentions the fire program
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
yeah and uh that's something we may want
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
to get some more information on
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of where are where are these
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
synergies right now and
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
and and um unfortunately we just don't
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
have the time here
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
we may be able to get somebody to come
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
in if we're looking at
 
01:40:05.669 --> 01:40:05.679 align:start position:0%
um next friday we have barbara
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
brittenham maybe we can park somebody
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
else in
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
there and maybe do the same thing and
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
make a larger conference type thing
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
either on wednesday too
 
01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
with um uh um
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
with uh don and with susan how and maybe
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
we could get
 
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know catherine provencher's also one
 
01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:24.470 align:start position:0%
you know catherine provencher's also one
that's

01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
as a previous treasurer of our state
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
and and now the interim chancellor maybe
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh it'd be wise to ask and i spoke
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
with catherine last night
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
and she's open to working with us she's
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
she's very good
 
01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
she's ready so maybe what i'll do is on
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
on the day that we're
 
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
next wednesday uh i'll i'll call up
 
01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:45.669 align:start position:0%
next wednesday uh i'll i'll call up
catherine

01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
catherine
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
and find out if there's somebody there
 
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
can help us a little bit with some of
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
this financial information
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
now remember also that right now there
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
is a briefing
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
going on with the division two right
 
01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.149 align:start position:0%
going on with the division two right
yeah

01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:58.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
and then they're going to have a
 
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
briefing on monday regarding the unique
 
01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:04.070 align:start position:0%
briefing on monday regarding the unique
program

01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i think we need to realize that
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do the study
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
that's what that's exactly right i i
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
understand that all we all we can do is
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
is kind of say
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
here are some issues that need to be
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
looked at before we
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
go down this road and i think well
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
we can also do that identify this
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
quote laundry list of of issues but
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
recommend these
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
issues to our higher education committee
 
01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:34.629 align:start position:0%
issues to our higher education committee
that

01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
we have right right statutory authority
 
01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:38.709 align:start position:0%
we have right right statutory authority
for

01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
um and for a resolution also send it off
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
to division two and say here's
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
you know some policy issues from the
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
policy committee
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
need answers yeah okay good
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not taking one side or the
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
other on this whole thing right now i'm
 
01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
pretty neutral on it
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
um i just feel like i'm out in left
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
field still i'm not even maybe in the
 
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
you're still trying to buy the ticket to
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
get in that's exactly
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
right oliver you got your hand up
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to ask you if you
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
could contribute anything about the
 
01:42:13.679 --> 01:42:14.390 align:start position:0%
could contribute anything about the
alaska

01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
alaska
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
experience which seems to have been
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
something that took an
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
awful lot of tinkering with to get it to
 
01:42:20.239 --> 01:42:21.270 align:start position:0%
awful lot of tinkering with to get it to
work

01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
well what happened up in alaska that the
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
governor of state don hammond um
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
we we had we had some issues and also
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
the geography of alaska you have
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
southeast alaska which is down
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
on that arm which goes down towards
 
01:42:39.199 --> 01:42:39.910 align:start position:0%
on that arm which goes down towards
washington

01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
washington
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
seattle area and then you have the rest
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
of state which is just
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
gigantic you could place alaska right on
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
top of the lower 48.
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
we also had in the latter part of the
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
80s the time when the oil glut was
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
occurred in the country
 
01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
and alaska is a singular economy based
 
01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:57.750 align:start position:0%
and alaska is a singular economy based
upon

01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
upon
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
oil the fishing industry is basically
 
01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:01.430 align:start position:0%
oil the fishing industry is basically
dead

01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
dead
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
and when oil revenues went down a barrel
 
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
of oil went down and sank
 
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
well well below 50 bucks a barrel the
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
revenues coming into the state
 
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
which supported education took a
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
drastic cut so all of a sudden there is
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
fewer dollars available for uaf
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
university alaska fairbanks which is
 
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
their flagship campus much like our unh
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
and uaa university alaska
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
anchorage which is uh situated right in
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
anchorage and draws
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks from that where half the
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
folks in alaska live
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
and then yeah at that time you had the
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
university of southeast alaska and now
 
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's called university of southern
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
alaska i guess or
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
something such as that they've remolded
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
that but that system
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
had to change the demographics the
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
community college
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
also had to change community colleges
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
were only
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
used to be when i was there just a
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
singular building in a remote community
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
and it was oriented at the skill
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
certificates and skill training
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
that uh and not even at the level
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
of the the certificate that we're
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
talking about here in
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we're talking about
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
subsistence type oriented cultures
 
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
and and and and and uh trying to provide
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
another route towards uh daily life
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
through education uh so it
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
it was it was it's a successful program
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
but it's very tailored
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
very tailored to the remoteness of
 
01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:32.950 align:start position:0%
very tailored to the remoteness of
alaska

01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
alaska
 
01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
we through unh do research with uaf
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
um poker flats is where they put those
 
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
missiles up to study the aurora borealis
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
um our folks down in in durham are are
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
part of that program
 
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
so so we do work cooperatively with uaf
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
um so i i would i would
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
in that report i'd be really curious to
 
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
learn a little bit more about the
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
connecticut model than what happened in
 
01:44:59.119 --> 01:45:00.310 align:start position:0%
connecticut model than what happened in
minnesota

01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
minnesota
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
um in states which are have more in
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
common with
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
okay all right okay hey guys thanks a

ecs material along with the
 
01:45:48.550 --> 01:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
sheets we got from the community college
 
01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:50.960 align:start position:0%

i i did mention that you had asked that
 
01:45:53.679 --> 01:45:54.629 align:start position:0%
i i did mention that you had asked that
question

01:45:54.629 --> 01:45:54.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
to provide us examples of post-secondary
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
mergers elsewhere in the country
 
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
and on the bottom of page one it had i
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at it right now as we're
 
01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:05.189 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at it right now as we're
speaking

01:46:05.189 --> 01:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh objectives of system mergers may
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
include but the following and listed
 
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:10.470 align:start position:0%
include but the following and listed
five

01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
real critical points uh i think those
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
five critical points
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
are points that we should be all looking
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
at the first one
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
is improved coordination and alignment
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
across the institutions
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh coordination and alignment that's
 
01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:26.470 align:start position:0%
uh coordination and alignment that's
important

01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
the second part is achieve cost savings
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
and efficiencies
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
ed mckay talked about efficiencies and
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
cost savings
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
but we should continue to hammer on that
 
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
one as well
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
number three expand access to credential
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
and degree programs
 
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
and academic courses we we we
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
talked about certification programs at
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
the community college the different
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
types of programs offered
 
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
and the fourth one is streamline credit
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
transfers we spent some
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
good time on transfers between various
 
01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
levels of education here and the fifth
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
one was
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
increase the flexibility of institutions
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
to respond to changes
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
in student and workforce domain demands
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
that is where the community college is
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
really nimble
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
right now working with regional business
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
the the unh is looking for those bigger
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
institution corporations and they
 
01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
also are are working with those large
 
01:47:22.639 --> 01:47:24.149 align:start position:0%
also are are working with those large
corporations

01:47:24.149 --> 01:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh however a small business is really

ecs
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
materials you got are really key for us
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
to follow those broad elements
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
with further questions and i've been
 
01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
going through the
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
paperwork that jennifer put together
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
that you sent out there's a lot there
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
and i have some notes and
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
once i get jennifer's notes and i see
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
what you touched on today i'll
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
i'll try to get caught up as you know i
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
did i did spend 20 years in the
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
community system in in seven years in
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
the university system
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
plus five years as an undergrad as a i
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
guess i was in the five year plan so
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
anyway i have some some uh personal
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
history in both systems
 
01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
that hopefully will be a little bit
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
useful so i'll try to get caught up in
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
sorry i missed a lot of what was here
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
today but i will try to get caught up
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's okay mike uh when you're also
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the reports look at the
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
consolidation of post-secondary systems
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
that report which was
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you say the term
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
nechams the national center for higher
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
education management systems was
 
01:48:25.199 --> 01:48:26.229 align:start position:0%
education management systems was
requested

01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
requested
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
to do a report for the community college
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
system on page 27
 
01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
of that report there's ten questions
 
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
those ten questions are good questions
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
for us to keep up on our heads so when
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
we meet with don burks next week
 
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
and with susan heward uh we try to you
 
01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:44.550 align:start position:0%
and with susan heward uh we try to you
know

01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
ask those questions and try to you know
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know get information back we're not
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
going to be able to make any resolutions
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
or determinations but we can at least
 
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
get these policy statements and facts
 
01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:55.910 align:start position:0%
get these policy statements and facts
down

01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
so we share it uh with the division two
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
also mike i don't know if you heard our
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
last part of the discussion
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about an rsa rsa 187
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
which speaks specifically to the public
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
higher education study committee
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
we have a legislative committee tasked
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
with the responsibilities
 
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
for looking at the organization and
 
01:49:19.599 --> 01:49:20.310 align:start position:0%
for looking at the organization and
structure

01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
of our post-secondary education systems
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's already there
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's already in statute so what we
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
should be doing as a result of this
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
is taking some of the findings and facts
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
that we in questions
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
which we have noting it and sending
 
01:49:37.589 --> 01:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
written comment
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
