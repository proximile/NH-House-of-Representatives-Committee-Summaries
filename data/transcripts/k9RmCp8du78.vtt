insurance department and these include
 
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
to permit third party administrators
 
00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 align:start position:0%
tpas that cannot meet licensing
 
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
requirements for either net worth or
 
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
audited financial statements to post a
 
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 align:start position:0%
bond instead
 
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
modernized language and RSA 412 colon 6
 
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
which regulates forms and rates for
 
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
Property and Casualty Insurance this
 
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 align:start position:0%
change clarifies excuse me Senator
 
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
please talk into the microphone thank
 
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.770 align:start position:0%
please talk into the microphone thank
you

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
this change clarifies the insurer's
 
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
obligations and deletes unnecessary
 
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
language in that statute further it
 
00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 align:start position:0%
clarifies the registration requirements
 
00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 align:start position:0%
in relation to Consumer guarantee
 
00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 align:start position:0%
contracts for Property and Casualty
 
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
Insurance this change to the statute
 
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
requires insurers to register if they're
 
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
going to sell consumer guarantee
 
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
contracts the change would allow the
 
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
department to track the exact number of
 
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
companies who are selling these
 
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 align:start position:0%
contracts it updates in an accurate RSA
 
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
reference in RSA 420 J colon 5 and
 
00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 align:start position:0%
lastly makes amendments to the statute
 
00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
on federal health care reform the change
 
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
to RSA 420n will clarify the
 
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
Department's primary regulatory
 
00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 align:start position:0%
authority over Insurance reforms
 
00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 align:start position:0%
implemented by the Affordable Care Act
 
00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 align:start position:0%
also extends to amendments to the ACA
 
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
and related laws Heather Silverstein
 
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department is here
 
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
and I think can answer your more
 
00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 align:start position:0%
technical questions should you have them
 
00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 align:start position:0%
but as always I remain open to questions
 
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and appreciate the
 
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here thank you very
 
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions from the
 
00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
committee members see none thank you
 
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
even though I know you wrote such a
 
00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing there for Senator Susie
 
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
to read I'm sure there's more detail
 
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
that you would love to go through
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Heather Silverstein I'm
 
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
general counsel at the New Hampshire
 
00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
insurance department uh yes thank you
 
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
senator soucy for introducing our bill
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
today uh we uh this is a technical bill
 
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
you know as we practice at the
 
00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 align:start position:0%
department and we are in the statutes
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
and we use the statute so we apply the
 
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
statutes there's times that we realize
 
00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 align:start position:0%
something is either out of date or not
 
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 align:start position:0%
working or confusing so this bill is our
 
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
effort to try to get some of the
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
language in our statutes up to date and
 
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
make it more clear that's the overall
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
premise of this particular bill with
 
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
regard to third party administrators
 
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
we're permitting a bond this is an
 
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
unusual situation it would be instead of
 
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
the normal Financial requirements
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
um the the it's in the situation
 
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
according to our financial director is
 
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
unusual but if a TPA was doing work for
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
an unlicensed insurance company that
 
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
would be the situation and they wanted a
 
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
license in New Hampshire so they wanted
 
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
a TPA license in New Hampshire and so um
 
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
he feels comfortable with the posting of
 
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
the bond in those situations so that's
 
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
why we're adding that language
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
the RSA 4126 with regard to Property and
 
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
Casualty contracts the language was
 
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 align:start position:0%
confusing confusing with regard to
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
prepayment of judgments and we didn't
 
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
want the language in there to make it
 
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
seem like whether the insured could pay
 
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
or not was a condition related to the
 
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
contract that is not you know something
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
that we would want as a condition in
 
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
there so we cleaned that up like we
 
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
needed we needed that to be more clear
 
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
with regard to RSA 415c our consumer
 
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 align:start position:0%
guarantee contracts
 
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
we want to know
 
00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
who is registered to sell them and
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire we don't know
 
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
all the players and so this these
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
changes here make it so that we know
 
00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 align:start position:0%
everybody that is selling these in New
 
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's important for us
 
00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 align:start position:0%
because if we want to at some point
 
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
maybe do an exam or do exams on these
 
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
particular entities we know who's
 
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
registered here so this is what this
 
00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
language did
 
00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
um to clean up 415c and then the last
 
00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
couple of changes were really like
 
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
correcting a typo with regard to 420 J5
 
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
in relation to annual reports the annual
 
00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
report reference and then under
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
um 420n you know just making it clear
 
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
that even if there's amendments to the
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act or other health
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
insurance related federal laws that we
 
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
are the primary regulator and we would
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
be the ones reviewing the forms related
 
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
to those laws so that's what this bill
 
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.969 align:start position:0%
to those laws so that's what this bill
does

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh the only question I have again
 
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
is the Surplus line so this is we're
 
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
trying to identify the people rather
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
than the the product right the product
 
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
still has to be submitted to the
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
department and and I know we have I
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
think I sponsored the legislation for
 
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
the instant instant uh approval of of a
 
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
submitted product but just this is the
 
00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
people who are actually selling it
 
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
exactly okay so we wanted to make that
 
00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
clear that we want to know everybody
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
that's selling
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from committee
 
00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
members seeing them thank you very much
 
00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
okay is there anybody else who would
 
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
speak on
 
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.240 --> 00:16:38.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on Senate Bill 82 and
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
hear from the prime sponsor Senator
 
00:16:42.839 --> 00:16:44.210 align:start position:0%
hear from the prime sponsor Senator
Susie

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
Susie
 
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
good morning again Senator good morning
 
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and committee members once
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
again Donna soucy representing Senate
 
00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:52.019 align:start position:0%
District 18.
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
this time here on Senate Bill 82
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
relative to prompt payment for managed
 
00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.829 align:start position:0%
relative to prompt payment for managed
care

00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
this bill merely attempts to ensure that
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
claims that are are processed in a
 
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
timely manner
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
providers here in New Hampshire have
 
00:17:11.689 --> 00:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
experienced delays in getting claims
 
00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
fully adjudicated processed and paid
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
according to the current statute and the
 
00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:21.299 align:start position:0%
delay has resulted in accounts
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
receivable for providers well beyond 90
 
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
days from the date of service what this
 
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
delay does is impacts patients when you
 
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
receive one of those this is not a bill
 
00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:36.299 align:start position:0%
explanation of benefit forms from the
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
carrier with the final balance due after
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
insurance payment those are not issued
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner if those are not
 
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919 align:start position:0%
being resolved in a timely manner you as
 
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
a consumer a patient don't recognize
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
what you owe
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
as part of provision of service based on
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
the insurance coverage that you have so
 
00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
what the bill attempts to do is reduce
 
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
or eliminate some of the ongoing issues
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
of unresolved processing of claims and
 
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
if the carriers have denied or suspended
 
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
a claim requested and received the
 
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
additional information from the provider
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
then this bill provides that the claim
 
00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:17.539 align:start position:0%
needs to be adjudicated within 45 days
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
after 45 days if the carrier fails to
 
00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
act fails to request additional
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
information or provide reason for
 
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
disputed payment the claim would be
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
treated as clean and then paid
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
essentially the issue Mr chairman is to
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that if the carriers are
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
providing coverage and as long as the
 
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
providers of service are providing the
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
necessary information to and clean claim
 
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
is a term of art that's used in the
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
statute um
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
these these bills do get paid and then
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
we as consumers can pay our share as
 
00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:03.419 align:start position:0%
well to the extent we are required based
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
on our own individual plans
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions I know
 
00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:09.539 align:start position:0%
there are folks here from the industry
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
as well as from the hospital Association
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
that will speak to you about more
 
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
specific instances where this has
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
occurred and has really led to
 
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.490 align:start position:0%
occurred and has really led to
um

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
concern and the reason for the bill
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
we do have a question yes representative
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
Terry thank you could you just give us a
 
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
uh a real world a hypothetical example
 
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
of what you've just described
 
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.730 align:start position:0%
of what you've just described
well

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
um I I did not bring any of my own
 
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
medical bills with me but I
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough that you asked that
 
00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:45.169 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough that you asked that
question

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
um last November not November of 23
 
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
November of 21 I fell and injured my
 
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.789 align:start position:0%
November of 21 I fell and injured my
knee

00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
knee
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
and I went to Urgent Care the time I did
 
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.130 align:start position:0%
and I went to Urgent Care the time I did
it

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:57.140 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.850 align:start position:0%
it
this

00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
past November November of 22
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
I received a statement and I
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
kind of scratched my head because I
 
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
couldn't figure out what it was
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
referring to and I looked at it a second
 
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
time when I did I realized it was the
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
claim from a year ago that was finally
 
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
being resolved now at that point I have
 
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
a plan with a deductible so I had
 
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:25.820 align:start position:0%
already satisfied my deductible
 
00:20:30.049 --> 00:20:30.059 align:start position:0%
but it it was left hanging I don't I
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
don't know the reason that it hadn't
 
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
been resolved but the entity that
 
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
provided me care that day in November of
 
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.930 align:start position:0%
provided me care that day in November of
21

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
21
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
did not receive payment from my carrier
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
until November of the following year
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
and that's the kind of situation we're
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid to the extent that all
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
of the proper information to make the
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
claim a clean claim has been satisfied
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
follow please for the question so
 
00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
so you had an incident in November of 21
 
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
and then in November of 22 you receive a
 
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.590 align:start position:0%
and then in November of 22 you receive a
bill

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
from the provider
 
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
the Urgent Care no no no what I received
 
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
was a statement
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
from my insurer saying that they had
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
paid the claim yes
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
because I have a deductible of two
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that had already been
 
00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
satisfied because of other services I
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
did not owe anything additionally but
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
the provider had not been paid until
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
and what we're trying to do is ensure
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
that those claims that have the
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate information provided to the
 
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
insurer just get paid in a timely
 
00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:54.539 align:start position:0%
fashion we just want them to pay what
 
00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:57.020 align:start position:0%
they have negotiated
 
00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:00.539 align:start position:0%
with the carrier as with the providers
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
and pay those bills which they did but
 
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
not in a timely fashion correct thank
 
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:05.810 align:start position:0%
not in a timely fashion correct thank
you

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs
 
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question I
 
00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:12.059 align:start position:0%
was wondering what the average time is
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
if you know to adjudicate these um
 
00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.010 align:start position:0%
if you know to adjudicate these um
claims

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
claims
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
um representative Burroughs I think
 
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
there are people who will testify after
 
00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:21.059 align:start position:0%
me it might be better suited to answer
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
the question off my own experience I
 
00:22:26.169 --> 00:22:26.179 align:start position:0%
couldn't give you a good answer
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up for the question again it
 
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
might be people coming after you but do
 
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
you know what the obstacles have been in
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
terms of why like your claim that you
 
00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
talk about took so long
 
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
um in in my specific instance it's
 
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
unclear to me why it did take so long
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
there I know have been some changes some
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
of the carriers have changed computer
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
systems that has caused delays there are
 
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
from time to time delays because a
 
00:22:54.649 --> 00:22:54.659 align:start position:0%
carrier fails to provide sufficient
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
information so that you know once again
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
would you know renew the clock and and
 
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
give uh excuse me the provider failed to
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
provide sufficient information
 
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:05.870 align:start position:0%
provide sufficient information
um

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
but we do know and as I said you will
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
hear testimony um particularly from the
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
hospital Association what is happening
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
is sometimes it can take 90 days 120
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
days I attended a legislative breakfast
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
of a Manchester Hospital this past week
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
and they have outstanding claims of more
 
00:23:30.169 --> 00:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
than a million six uh that are well over
 
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
120 days so what that does to The Entity
 
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
is then it makes it harder for them in
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
turn to pay their bills and we're just
 
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
uh a little more efficiency and
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
timeliness of payment
 
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
so uh Senator before you go uh jog my
 
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
memory I feel like we just did this
 
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
legislation not so long ago about the
 
00:23:59.330 --> 00:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
timely payments so am I crazy or you
 
00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:00.419 align:start position:0%
don't remember
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
um we we may have done other legislation
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Church yeah we remember but
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
but tell you that there is an ongoing
 
00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:09.419 align:start position:0%
issue that
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
so and then the way I read the bill is
 
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
they they have these dates if you put in
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
45 days but
 
00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:21.289 align:start position:0%
45 days but
um

00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:21.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:24.059 align:start position:0%
it but I see that that within 15 days
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
supposed to Mclean 30 days upon receipt
 
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
and then and then processing and
 
00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
explaining why it's not paid timely then
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
and you scratch out if the required
 
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
notice is not provided
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm not sure what the consequence
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
of taking that phrase out but all I see
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
is that it fails to provide required
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
notice but that which is
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
saying the same thing right it fails to
 
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
require the dose we just said if the
 
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
requirement is not provided so it just
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
seems a little bizarre and then we have
 
00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
a new date a new number thrown in here
 
00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:00.500 align:start position:0%
and and I just wasn't sure how that
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
follows with the 15 and the 30 days that
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
are already in the statute well once
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
again the the
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
FIP out submission of the claim
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
to be clear we're taking out the
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
required notice part and expanding on it
 
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.059 align:start position:0%
to be sure that it's clear that the
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
carrier has to provide notice and their
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
failure to do so
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
within 45 days we're trying to give a
 
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
decent window of time to resolve the
 
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:30.890 align:start position:0%
decent window of time to resolve the
claim

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
claim
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
results in it being deemed clean clean
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
and their need to pay
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
but Jory they've already says that they
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
need to make a notice of why they're not
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
paying it
 
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
they had as long as the statutes is
 
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
saying you give us the reasoning
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
and then you're just repeating the same
 
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.250 align:start position:0%
and then you're just repeating the same
thing

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:54.260 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
but now you have this penalty is that if
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
if you didn't if they if whatever notice
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
they got they didn't get it or they
 
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
didn't see it or they didn't but now all
 
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
of a sudden you're gonna they're gonna
 
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
call up and say now you've got to pay it
 
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
and the insurance company is going to
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
say what do you mean you got to pay it
 
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
we're in compliance because we can
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
comply with the first part
 
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
chairman I think what we are trying to
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
do is make more explicit that the
 
00:26:27.649 --> 00:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
carrier has an obligation to adjudicate
 
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
the claim within the 45 days and failure
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
to do so I think this just makes the
 
00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:36.539 align:start position:0%
language more Express because as I said
 
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
this although we have you're right I
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
think I'm not sure how many years ago
 
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
have been looking at this statute
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
there is still a problem with long
 
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
outstanding claims without adequate
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
notice to the provider of how to resolve
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
them and it's resulting in burden on the
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
providers right so but basically this is
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
I guess the key word in this case is
 
00:27:03.649 --> 00:27:03.659 align:start position:0%
adjudicate in other words you you're
 
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
expecting that within 45 days this thing
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
is going to get solved
 
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.590 align:start position:0%
is going to get solved
unless

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
unless
 
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
unless the carrier requires additional
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
information and provides notice
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
right but that was already required
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
before 30 days
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
so in this case it it implies that even
 
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
if they did give Carter more information
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter at 45 days it's got to
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
be adjudicated because they've already
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
give the notice or the explanation of
 
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
why it wasn't paid on time
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
but all right we'll we'll review this in
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
in committee we'll have a subcommittee
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
on it yeah
 
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:53.330 align:start position:0%
on it yeah
[Music]

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
yes I don't know how many exchanges they
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
had with the provider
 
00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:00.169 align:start position:0%
had with the provider
um the

00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
that I uh went to
 
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
um but yes they would have because they
 
00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
needed to provide notice of the reason
 
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
that they are failing to pay the claim
 
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
and absent doing so it should be deemed
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
clean and they should have paid
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gibbs you have a
 
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:28.730 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gibbs you have a
question

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:34.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:43.490 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
and then uh from the question uh
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
the requirements is that the ensure
 
00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:54.539 align:start position:0%
notify the health care provider for
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
public portion of the reason for denying
 
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
or that this problem is explained
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh my question is and and I'm going to
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:11.409 --> 00:29:11.419 align:start position:0%
um uh my question is did you consider
 
00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:15.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to get to the inter
 
00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
shall notify both the provider and the
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
covered position of the problem and the
 
00:29:32.169 --> 00:29:32.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
when I received a bill to 37 000 from
 
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
the hospital uh because I have Medicare
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
part A but not Part B because I kept my
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
employer providers provided
 
00:29:48.059 --> 00:29:54.230 align:start position:0%
employer providers provided
foreign

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
and the hospital was not provided all
 
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
the information that was needed uh to
 
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:06.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
about the dollar bill so I had no idea
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
of this until I received the third and
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
seven thousand dollar bill which was
 
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.549 align:start position:0%
seven thousand dollar bill which was
about

00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
six or seven most active surgery
 
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:21.950 align:start position:0%
six or seven most active surgery
God

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
God
 
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:29.769 align:start position:0%
God
died

00:30:29.769 --> 00:30:29.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
okay let's let her answer the question
 
00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:36.299 align:start position:0%
okay but my point is that if they had no
 
00:30:36.299 --> 00:30:46.870 align:start position:0%
okay but my point is that if they had no
replies

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
both through Survivor and
 
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
so thanks for that question
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs no I didn't
 
00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
consider that I mean that's certainly
 
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
something that I think the committee and
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
its wisdom could consider because you
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
are right there are times that um
 
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
perhaps intervening as the patient
 
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.289 align:start position:0%
perhaps intervening as the patient
particularly

00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:06.299 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
for those of us that have a deductible
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
to meet earlier in time you want to
 
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
resolve those issues and hopefully get
 
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
them paid so that may make sense to uh
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
have those of us who are patients uh
 
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
intervene and assist with trying to
 
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
resolve these claims more quickly but I
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
leave that to the committee
 
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.230 align:start position:0%
leave that to the committee
okay

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
I guess we're all set thank you thank

00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
senability too and we do appreciate
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Souci sponsoring this bill as
 
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
well as all the co-sponsors with
 
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support this does amend the
 
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
prompt pay statute slightly we did ask
 
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie to put this bill in
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
um and the reason
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
um I think she did a great job
 
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
explaining why we need it but it is to
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
ensure ultimately that the health care
 
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
claims that are submitted to the
 
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
carriers are in fact processed in a
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
timely manner and unfortunately our
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
hospitals have experienced ongoing
 
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
delays in having claims processed in a
 
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
timely manner so what 82 does is merely
 
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
clarify when the carrier either denies
 
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
or suspends which is the current um
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
statute we don't have the entire Statute
 
00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:00.419 align:start position:0%
in the bill would just amending a
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
certain part of that statute that the
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
carrier receives the additional
 
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
information that they are that was
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
requested from the hospital or the
 
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
health care
 
00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:15.059 align:start position:0%
provider they must adjudicate within the
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
45 days and the problem is if they don't
 
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
adjudicate what happens because that's
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
the that's kind of the loophole if you
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
will right now they don't adjudicate
 
00:33:27.289 --> 00:33:27.299 align:start position:0%
within 45 days so what we did was we
 
00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:30.299 align:start position:0%
took existing statute and chairman hunt
 
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
you did identify that right now it says
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
if the required notice is not provided
 
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
well that's not necessarily the issue
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
what we did was we took that and we just
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
changed that that language we remove
 
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
that and then we just added if the
 
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
health carrier either fails to provide
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
required notice or and the new languages
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
to adjudicate the claim within 45
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
calendar days of receipt of additional
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
information that's the new language so
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
we're just saying you have all the
 
00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:03.059 align:start position:0%
requirements before and then if you
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
don't do it within 45 days then it
 
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
becomes a clean claim which I think
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs articulated so
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
that's really what this does this has
 
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
um the claims the delays in claims
 
00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:17.099 align:start position:0%
processing as Senator Susie said does
 
00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
cause much confusion for patients as um
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
because the claims are not processed in
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
a timely manner the responsibility the
 
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
patient responsibility determine it is
 
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
many months later results in confusion
 
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%
they get the EOB or the explanation of
 
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
benefits from the carrier then the
 
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
patient responsibility balance due from
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
the provider is sent and confusion
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
ensues so on behalf of the hospitals and
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
the patients that we care for we do
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
strongly urge you to support this bill
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions I
 
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
do can I just answer the comment or
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
question that representative Gibbs had
 
00:34:55.089 --> 00:34:55.099 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
sending bills at the same time I think
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
that could cause even more confusion and
 
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
I believe I don't see the contracts
 
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
between the providers and the carriers
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't believe they're allowed to
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
bill the patient you don't you don't
 
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
send a bill to a patient it would just
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
really cause confusion um so it's really
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
waiting for the processing and then
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
whatever the balance is due
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
um and I think in this case it was a um
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
a case of not of not having the provider
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
not having all the information on all
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
the insurer Insurance
 
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
um plans that um perhaps you had at the
 
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
time so um so that that is a
 
00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
coordination of benefits because
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
typically they would know if you have
 
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
part A and a supplemental then they
 
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
would know to Bill Medicare first and
 
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
then the supplemental follows so
 
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
um that I think was just a case of not
 
00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
having all the additional all the
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
information that unfortunately that they
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
needed I I don't believe
 
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:55.079 align:start position:0%
um sending a bill to the patient would
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
help I think it could actually cause
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
more confusion because we don't want
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
patients paying for claims that are
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
covered by Insurance
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
um but that's so that's not what we're
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
asking we're just asking that these be
 
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
processed in a timely manner so happy to
 
00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.970 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:18.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
well this is really a a follow-up
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
comment um so would you believe or the
 
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
question okay would you believe yes uh
 
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I was not asking
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
that anyone send me a bill which however
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
they eventually did uh for a uh a
 
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
payment that was actually owed by Blue
 
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.250 align:start position:0%
payment that was actually owed by Blue
Cross

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
Cross
 
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
um and yes it was a coordination of
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
benefits problem but I had in fact
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
provided to them with all the
 
00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
information they just had not recorded
 
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
it correctly and this is what they told
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
me they had not recorded it correctly
 
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
and therefore had not provided all the
 
00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
information either to Medicare or to
 
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
Blue Cross and therefore Medicare and
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
Blue Cross were just passing it back and
 
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
forth both refusing to pay it which then
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
as I said six or seven months later
 
00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
resulted in them sending me a bill which
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
in fact I did not owe so what I was
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
suggesting was not that anybody send me
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
a bill which I wish they had not done
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
but they did anyway but rather that they
 
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
send but what I was suggesting and I
 
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
guess my question is then do you see a
 
00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
problem with this uh send a notice to
 
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
the patient that there's a problem
 
00:37:32.329 --> 00:37:32.339 align:start position:0%
because it was only when I got involved
 
00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:35.099 align:start position:0%
that okay so I think I think we got it
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
was resolved I think we got it I think
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
the problem with that yeah yes
 
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.490 align:start position:0%
the problem with that yeah yes
yeah

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:42.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
would you believe it could just be yes
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
um I I Healthcare is very complicated
 
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
and insurance billing is really
 
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
complicated so I do believe that um
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
there was a error um and I I am hopeful
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
that it got resolved in a um in a
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
positive manner that um you were um that
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
you were satisfied with okay
 
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
representative Terry has another
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you so I I love these
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
terms that that we get uh on a routine
 
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.130 align:start position:0%
terms that that we get uh on a routine
basis

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
um and and the term here is clean claim
 
00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:20.180 align:start position:0%
in distinction I presume to dirty claim
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that's what you mean
 
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
clean versus dirty but that the term is
 
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
not defined here so one so I just want
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
you to be sure here that clean actually
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
means that there's no more no more
 
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
information that's going to be requested
 
00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
or provided there's no more anything it
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
just becomes finalized that is it's all
 
00:38:47.329 --> 00:38:47.339 align:start position:0%
finished and you have to pay the claim
 
00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
right thank you for the question
 
00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:53.579 align:start position:0%
um and yes these um terms are defined so
 
00:38:55.329 --> 00:38:55.339 align:start position:0%
if you go to
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
420j8 small a prompt pay request so go
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
to go to the definitions there is a
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
definition of clean claim and it is and
 
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
it is means a claim for payment of
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
covered health care expenses that is
 
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
submitted to a health carrier on the
 
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
carrier's standard claim form using the
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
most current Pub published procedural
 
00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
codes with all the required Fields

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
believe I was involved in this back in
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
2000 when this um bill and I believe
 
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt was here too so I believe
 
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
that's when this this original prompeii
 
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
law was passed back in 2000. so there
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%

in the past months for something
 
00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
um in relationship to medical stuff
 
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
um let's see here I've been employed at
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
Pembroke Wellness Center for over 25
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
years and I've been doing billing for
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
Pembroke Wellness Center for 20 years so
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
I am very well versed
 
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
in the medical billing world because
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
that's how we survive as an independent
 
00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:14.579 align:start position:0%
practice at Pembroke Wellness Center my
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
husband sold the practice just three
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
four months ago to another independent
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
physician Dr Jennifer McKenzie I am in
 
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
very strong support of SB 82 as a family
 
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
practice office we don't usually deal
 
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
with large-scale claims meaning volume
 
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:34.140 align:start position:0%
as large numbers but recently
 
00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:34.730 align:start position:0%
as large numbers but recently
um

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
I had a claim deny with no reason behind
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
this denial code which was denial code
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
co45 which I'll just quickly read that
 
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
it meant charges exceed your contractual
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
legislative fee Arrangement note this
 
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
adjusted amount cannot equal the total
 
00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:53.099 align:start position:0%
service charge amount basically the line
 
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
item just denied and it happened to be a
 
00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
line item that was over one thousand
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
dollars which in our field in my family
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
practice office we never bill out
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar claims except this
 
00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.990 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar claims except this
particular

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339 align:start position:0%
item that we were doing or dealing with
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
was a medical device that we were using
 
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
on a particular patient
 
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank goodness in our office we can um
 
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
uh bill on um uh ordering I had 90 days
 
00:42:21.849 --> 00:42:21.859 align:start position:0%
to pay for this particular item because
 
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
we actually in our small office our
 
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
checkbook only runs ten to twenty
 
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars maximum at any given
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
time so having to pay for an item that
 
00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:32.339 align:start position:0%
cost a thousand dollars and having the
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
insurance company deny said item
 
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
um the claim was submitted to the
 
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
insurance company clean there was zero
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
errors on the claim so I had been
 
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
watching this particular claim the
 
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
patient was seen on January 25th it was
 
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
billed clean electronically on the 25th
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
I received a partial payment on 220
 
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
meaning three of the line items totally
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
paid clean the actual device denied no
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
idea why I had to pick up the phone on
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
221 most places would not notice that
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
that but I was watching because I needed
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
that money to come through our door
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
I called and they said huh don't know
 
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:11.930 align:start position:0%
I called and they said huh don't know
why

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
we'll resubmit it to X Y and Z insurance
 
00:43:17.569 --> 00:43:17.579 align:start position:0%
company I called again on 321 still
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
waiting for my payment to come through
 
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
the door it did pay on 328 but it did
 
00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.970 align:start position:0%
the door it did pay on 328 but it did
require

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
my person to pay me
 
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
what amounted to be almost an hour's
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
worth of time on a phone just getting a
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
line item paid that should never have
 
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
not paid
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
the other interesting thing to me was
 
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
there was Zero interest that came with
 
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
this line item that should have been
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
paid cleanly straight out the door but
 
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.950 align:start position:0%
paid cleanly straight out the door but
hey

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
hey
 
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.470 align:start position:0%
hey
um

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much it on that so
 
00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:53.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
I know Paula minahan
 
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.410 align:start position:0%
I know Paula minahan
[Laughter]

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
but we appreciate having a real life
 
00:44:16.619 --> 00:44:19.010 align:start position:0%
but we appreciate having a real life
example

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
I have one card left uh Sabrina Dunlap
 
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
from anthem
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
committee I'll be very brief Sabrina
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
Dunlap I'm director of government
 
00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
relations for Anthem we do oppose the
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
bill we think it's repetitive and
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
unnecessary but if it does move forward
 
00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:50.579 align:start position:0%
we have a very small requested edit just
 
00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
to clarify that the information that
 
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
comes in is the actual information that
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
is needed and necessary to process the
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
claim and I have a copy of the full 420
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
j8a to show you where the little piece
 
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
fits into the bigger picture if that
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
would be helpful but it's just one minor
 
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
change to add a word that says receipt
 
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
of the requested additional information
 
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
not just receipt of additional
 
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.089 align:start position:0%
not just receipt of additional
information

00:45:17.089 --> 00:45:17.099 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:45:17.099 --> 00:45:25.790 align:start position:0%
information
okay

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
currently at least one of these audits
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
must be on site and Senate Bill 99 would
 
00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
remove this on-site requirement
 
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:54.020 align:start position:0%
the kova 19 pandemic led to a rapid
 
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
implementation of virtual business
 
00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
practices during this time the New
 
00:47:59.089 --> 00:47:59.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department like that
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
of most other states gave insurance
 
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
companies temporary allowance to conduct
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
their administrator audits virtually the
 
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
success of virtual audits makes
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
permanent modernization of administrator
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
audit laws both prudent And Timely
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
since insurance carriers are ultimately
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
accountable for the administrators with
 
00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:16.619 align:start position:0%
whom they contract it is the insured it
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
is in the insurer's best interest to
 
00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
complete effective comprehensive audits
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
control audits there we go
 
00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
virtual audits allow insurers to observe
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
administrative staff where they
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
primarily work in the digital Realm
 
00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
virtual audits are more accurate
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
inclusive and efficient and more
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
efficient than in-person audits insurers
 
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
should have the discretion to decide
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
whether an audit would be more effective
 
00:49:04.849 --> 00:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
virtually or in person thank you for
 
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
allowing me the opportunity to speak
 
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
this morning I will defer any questions
 
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
to The Advocates behind me
 
00:49:13.569 --> 00:49:13.579 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you very much
 
00:49:16.609 --> 00:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
Heather Silverstein from the insurance
 
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
department and is in
 
00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:20.990 align:start position:0%
department and is in
oh

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:49:22.849 --> 00:49:22.859 align:start position:0%
he doesn't know anything he doesn't know
 
00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:27.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
okay so do you have a question you can
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
ask me I couldn't hear it
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
no question but I'll whoever you ask me
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
the question ask what is the question
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
yeah if they want if they if they're
 
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
talking about virtual reviews right
 
00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
should we be able to have the word in
 
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
here that says that okay so we now have
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
the insurance departments coming up okay
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
and that would be a great question for
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
you to ask her
 
00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
no I understand
 
00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.849 align:start position:0%
no I understand
okay

00:49:55.849 --> 00:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
142. okay oh I think
 
00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that would be great
 
00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
we would want to know whether you guys
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
are in support of the question of the of
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
the bill anyways
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
you could say you don't take a position
 
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
uh good morning
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
um Heather Silverstein General counselor
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire insurance
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
department and with me is Doug Bartlett
 
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
our financial director for the insurance
 
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
department uh yes you know we don't take
 
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
a position as far as this bill goes
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
um which is why I wasn't planning on
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
speaking on it and I can have Doug fill
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
in the holes too as I speak it is
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
correct during the pandemic there was
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
difficulty with getting audits done the
 
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
insurers are part of their obligations
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
with regard to tpas is that they have to
 
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
audit these tpas and the way the statute
 
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
used to read was that it was appeared to
 
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
be in person and so this change allows
 
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
it to be
 
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
um electronically which is something
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
that as a department often when we do
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
examinations of our companies they used
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
to be in person and now there's plenty
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
of times we review the files
 
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
electronically so we understand that you
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
can still do that
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
um you can still fulfill the the
 
00:51:26.089 --> 00:51:26.099 align:start position:0%
obligation in electronic manner as we do
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
with our exams but I can have Doug fill
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
in more okay so I'll but I'll ask you
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
right out of the block doug because I
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
know we charge when we do an on-site
 
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
audit there's a fee we do right yeah we
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
I say we as the state of New Hampshire
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
I'm taking ownership yes yes we is in
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
here we we our insurance department
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
charges for that visit so when first
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
reading this it looks like all of a
 
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
sudden now we just saved some money to
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
that for the energy because we are not
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
going to do that on it but of course we
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
are doing that audit but you're doing
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
the audience this is this is the third
 
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
party person doing the insurance company
 
00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
uses a TPA to settle two games okay
 
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
this law says you have to audit them
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
twice a year
 
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
it's got nothing to do with insurance
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
right okay just that uh all right and um
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue neutral Revenue I get that okay
 
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
just thank you for clarifying that for
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
me so the question then would be is
 
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
um in terms of your support or
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
non-support what is the consequence or
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
why was this why was it put in the bill
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
in the first place you know why is it in
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
the law probably written a long time ago
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
when people used to do physical audits
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
before computers inside it's just never
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
changed and and and uh
 
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
as Heather mentioned and the person
 
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
before me mentioned during covid
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know they did all virtual audits for
 
00:52:59.650 --> 00:52:59.660 align:start position:0%
lack of a better word okay and and
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
they're fine I mean when we do exams
 
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
examinations of companies
 
00:53:08.329 --> 00:53:08.339 align:start position:0%
we usually only physically there when we
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
interview management management right
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
and and do the management interviews and
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
maybe go you know a week every two
 
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
months or something just to
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
show a presence but but this legislate
 
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with that in
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
particular this is just using the TBA
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
okay great so uh representative spear
 
00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
I've found there's somebody else in the
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
room who will be able to answer your
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
question and they will be next
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.390 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
members

00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:38.300 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay Henry
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh and members of
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
Henry vayu and I'm here on behalf of the
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
American Council of Life insurers
 
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
uh which is the group that asked Senator
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
ricciardi to sponsor the bill so the
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
requires the insurance company
 
00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
to semi-annually audit their third party
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
administrators so it's separate from
 
00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:18.740 align:start position:0%
what the department does
 
00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:20.780 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
says that at least one of them has to be
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
on site
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
now New Hampshire is only one of 13
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
states that still requires an on-site
 
00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:34.940 align:start position:0%
um audit
 
00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:38.900 align:start position:0%
the statute was enacted well before
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
there was an ability to do remote uh
 
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.150 align:start position:0%
there was an ability to do remote uh
auditing

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
auditing
 
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
um now some of the tpas don't even have
 
00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
office space
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
um they're they're doing it remotely
 
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
and so sometimes our folks will rent
 
00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
some space to meet with the
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
people so they can fulfill the statute
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
so I think the pandemic proved that it
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
can be done this way
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
um and we approached the department back
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
in the fall I spoke with the
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner because we wanted to make
 
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
sure they were fine uh with the bill
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and as um was stated he said we're
 
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
not going to take a position on the bill
 
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
that's something for the legislature to
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
decide but you know it worked well
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
through the pandemic and that seems to
 
00:55:35.569 --> 00:55:35.579 align:start position:0%
be where everything is headed so it's a
 
00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:38.339 align:start position:0%
pretty simple bill it still requires the
 
00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:40.140 align:start position:0%
audits to be done
 
00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:40.730 align:start position:0%
audits to be done
um

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
they were very effective dun remotely
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
through the pandemic and that's all
 
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
we're looking for and again we're still
 
00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
just one of 13 states that requires uh
 
00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
on site gradually they're you know
 
00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
removing that in the statute so
 
00:55:59.210 --> 00:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
great uh we do have questions
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
 
00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:02.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
our questions
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
are there any requirements to preserve
 
00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
physical documents uh as part of record
 
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
keeping that
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
may need to be examined physically
 
00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
um I will ask
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
my person at acli I'm not you know
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
intricately involved in this stuff but I
 
00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
will get you the answer before you guys
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
exactly on the committee
 
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
okay representative spirit
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
so now that I have the right person I'm
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
sorry about that uh you took out the
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
line that says at least one such review
 
00:56:41.809 --> 00:56:41.819 align:start position:0%
shall be on site but you don't say the
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
line that should say it could be done
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
remotely so it kind of sounds like a
 
00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
free-for-all at this point so should you
 
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
have something in there that says I
 
00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any problem I think uh
 
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
that's what we were attending uh and
 
00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
assuming but to make it clearer if if
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
you think it should be in there it'd be
 
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099 align:start position:0%
a friendly Amendment excuse me following
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
but if you do it remotely
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
you could still provide any hard paper
 
00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
via email or whatever exactly that might
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
be needed that you were going to look up
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
is that true correct that's correct
 
00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.470 align:start position:0%
is that true correct that's correct
okay

00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much all right
 
00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.569 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much all right
okay

00:57:23.569 --> 00:57:23.579 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
having no more cards instead about 99
 
00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll close the public hearing and
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 99.
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
and we'll go to subcommittee
 
00:57:33.119 --> 00:57:36.549 align:start position:0%
and we'll go to subcommittee
please

00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
so Henry do you mind just figuring out
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
how you want to rewrite it so I can get
 
00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
it and get the amendment I'm trying to
 
00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:49.010 align:start position:0%
it and get the amendment I'm trying to
thanks

00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:54.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:58.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
last but not least Mr chairman did we
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
say we wanted an amendment I I just told
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
yeah yes but did
 
00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:08.700 align:start position:0%
you say so you want an amendment I want
 
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
the amendment so when we went into this
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
committee we can discuss it
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
you know but that that in general
 
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
um I usually like to have the language
 
00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
worked out ahead of time so the
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee won't then about to have
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
another subcommittee if it you know try
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

um serving as chair of Fish and Game I'm
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
introducing Senate Bill 142 it's a
 
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
request of the insurance department this
 
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
bill passed the Senate on a consent
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
calendar with a 5-0 vote in the United
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote on consent
 
00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:29.339 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 142 clarifies stature
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
which regulates forms and rates for
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
property Casualty Insurance the
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
department proves removing the phrase
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
Rating Bureau and rating organization
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
from the forms and rates law and RSA for
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
412 both are Antiquated phrases that are
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
no longer in use by at the department
 
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
the current relevant term is advisory
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
organization this bill also amends RSA
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
412 colon 16 to clarify the language
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
regarding confidentiality of insurers
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
proprietary information submitted with a
 
00:59:59.569 --> 00:59:59.579 align:start position:0%
rate of rater rule filings
 
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
language change simply clarifies the
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
scope of the provision and was not
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
intended to expand or reduce it but
 
01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.990 align:start position:0%
intended to expand or reduce it but
clarify

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%

01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%

department is here to give a more
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
complete understanding because I know
 
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
almost nothing about the insurance
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
department other than they know my phone
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
number and asked me to file this bill so
 
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:20.040 align:start position:0%

01:00:34.329 --> 01:00:34.339 align:start position:0%

general counsel for the Hampshire
 
01:00:42.049 --> 01:00:42.059 align:start position:0%
insurance department and thank you to
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang for introducing this bill
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
for us and being a sponsor again this
 
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
bill is I've talked to Christian cirella
 
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
he's our opinion he's our chief PNC
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
actuary and after
 
01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.190 align:start position:0%
actuary and after
um

01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
his practice again as we practice with
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
the statute in our work on a daily basis
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis there are sometimes
 
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
tweaks that we need to be made and
 
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
according to Christian
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
um it's you know in working with rates
 
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
and approving rates for Property and
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
Casualty at the department
 
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
um you know he noticed that this term
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
Rating Bureau and rating organization
 
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
are in our statute and we don't even
 
01:01:24.049 --> 01:01:24.059 align:start position:0%
know what that means anymore it's out of
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
date advisory organization is different
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
and so that's the part where we just
 
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
want to change get rid of Rating Bureau
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
get rid of writing organization and just
 
01:01:36.289 --> 01:01:36.299 align:start position:0%
limit it to advisory organization
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
because we do license those
 
01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:41.579 align:start position:0%
organizations that will submit rates on
 
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
behalf of companies we allow these
 
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
advisor organizations to do that if
 
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
they're licensed with us the other piece
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
of this and I'm I am often drawn into
 
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
write to no requests at the department
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
in my position and what is permitted to
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
be disclosed and what is not permitted
 
01:02:02.589 --> 01:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
to be disclosed and
 
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
we have different confidentiality
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
provisions and then one of the
 
01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
exceptions for not disclosing something
 
01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
would be proprietary information and
 
01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
this language is just clarifying that
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
predictive models that companies use
 
01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
when they engage in determining rates
 
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
for you know insureds are proprietary so
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
we are just clarifying that we consider
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
that proprietary we want the company to
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
still identify that that these are this
 
01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
is proprietary and confidential
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
information but that's really what this
 
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
is is clarifying the rates still become
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
public it's not that we're trying to
 
01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:40.940 align:start position:0%
hide the rate but anything that would be
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
proprietary like a predictive model that
 
01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
really needs to be clarified we feel in
 
01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
the statute and that's why we want to
 
01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
make these changes
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative Terry can you speak uh
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just fascinated on the history of
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
ratings bureaus and advisory
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
organizations can you just speak uh
 
01:03:03.049 --> 01:03:03.059 align:start position:0%
briefly as to uh what happened over the
 
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
the course of the years that rating
 
01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:07.859 align:start position:0%
bureaus just disappeared and or did they
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
change their name or is this a broader
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
group now could you just elaborate a
 
01:03:14.809 --> 01:03:14.819 align:start position:0%
little bit on that so I've been at the
 
01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
department since 2015 and in my current
 
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
position since 2018
 
01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
and I know that this came up in the past
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
where we kind of scratched our heads as
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
to you know Rating Bureau ratings
 
01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:28.380 align:start position:0%
organization so I want to say sometime
 
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
before 2015 it kind of fell away now I
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
don't know if that has to do with the
 
01:03:35.569 --> 01:03:35.579 align:start position:0%
National Association of insurance
 
01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
Commissioners like sometimes they have
 
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
had terms Annie I see has had terms in
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
the past and then they changed their
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
terms over time which we change our
 
01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
terms over time too
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
um to kind of catch up so that may be
 
01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:50.900 align:start position:0%
why I'm not sure
 
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
 
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:03:57.289 --> 01:03:57.299 align:start position:0%
our questions just zeroing in on the
 
01:03:59.089 --> 01:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
predictive model is that something the
 
01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
department sees or they see it but they
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
don't disclose it to the public we see
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
it Christian will review it Christian
 
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
will see it when he's looking at the
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
rates to approve the rates but then
 
01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
um just label confidential we keep that
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
confidential so that is not public um
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
and so this is just for the question oh
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Mr chair so the
 
01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
predictive model can be like a
 
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that's easy to follow or it
 
01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
could be something like artificial
 
01:04:29.329 --> 01:04:29.339 align:start position:0%
intelligence that's a black box to a
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
regulator are you seeing me I know it
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
means something to Christian it seems a
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
actuary but if you would ask me to look
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
at it I probably could I think this is a
 
01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
great learning moment so basically what
 
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here is when we say
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
about the insurance company's secret
 
01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
formula and I used to joke about the guy
 
01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579 align:start position:0%
with the green shade and he's the one
 
01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
who uh who may look at a particular
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
legislation we pass and and say okay now
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
I need to add a predictability into our
 
01:05:02.329 --> 01:05:02.339 align:start position:0%
calculation of what your premium is
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
going to be and that I have to rate that
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
risk and figure out how much or how
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
great it is and what it is and what is
 
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
the statistical odds of it occurring and
 
01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
all of that is what is the secret sauce
 
01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
of an insurance product so you always
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
say how did they come up with this
 
01:05:23.809 --> 01:05:23.819 align:start position:0%
premium well they actually have to prove
 
01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:26.099 align:start position:0%
to the Department
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
their logic
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's what Christian is doing he's
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
going to look at their spreadsheet and
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
the numbers have gotta he's going to
 
01:05:34.849 --> 01:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
look at he's not just the spreading as
 
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
it calculations it's going to look at
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
what are the parameters that you're
 
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
putting in what are the assumptions that
 
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
they're making and that that's what
 
01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
they're getting from the advisory
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
organizations who are again saying but
 
01:05:49.609 --> 01:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
you know what we advise what we think
 
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
these things may be
 
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
um and and basically give the tools to
 
01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
that insurance company to make those
 
01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:59.089 align:start position:0%
that insurance company to make those
calculations

01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
make a comment just yes computers are
 
01:06:04.809 --> 01:06:04.819 align:start position:0%
replacing the the man with the green
 
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
the guy with the green change is still
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
there because he's got to come up he's
 
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
got it and like you say AI
 
01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
could you know could an AI uh uh figure
 
01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
out what are the statistical odds or
 
01:06:17.329 --> 01:06:17.339 align:start position:0%
something happens well then they have to
 
01:06:19.549 --> 01:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
look at statistics calculations what
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
occurs but at the end of the day there's
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
always that human factor is do I really
 
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
think this is really gonna there's claim
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
gonna be made on this issue or not or
 
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
that that calculation so I I I don't
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
think the green shade guy is ever going
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
to lose his job but but yes AI could
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
play a part in
 
01:06:40.569 --> 01:06:40.579 align:start position:0%
um sharpening his his uh his his
 
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
calculations and I will say that you
 
01:06:44.809 --> 01:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
know one of one of the main things
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
especially with PNC because it's
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
competitive rates you know related
 
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
competitive rates
 
01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:49.789 align:start position:0%
competitive rates
um

01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
you know Christian reviews whether the
 
01:06:53.329 --> 01:06:53.339 align:start position:0%
rates are discriminatory you know like
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
so you can't have you know a way to get
 
01:06:58.250 --> 01:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
to a a premium or rates based on
 
01:06:59.809 --> 01:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
discriminatory Factor so he would
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
consider those types of things when he's
 
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
looking at these predictive models too
 
01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
it represents appear do you have a
 
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
question or is you asking a question to
 
01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
yes but I'm
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
I don't even know how to phrase it but
 
01:07:15.289 --> 01:07:15.299 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking is I I'm trying to read
 
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
this and I understand that there's a a
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
portion of
 
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
the predictability for premiums is done
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
by an Actuarial kind of calculation and
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
all that kind of stuff and you have a
 
01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
group of people that or a person that
 
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
reviews that to make sure it's makes
 
01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.289 align:start position:0%
reviews that to make sure it's makes
sense

01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:33.299 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
in this bill you're talking about
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
other data that is not necessary for the
 
01:07:42.049 --> 01:07:42.059 align:start position:0%
calculation of policy premium
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
what kind of other data are we talking
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
about that is not necessary
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
so that so I know and this is from my
 
01:07:50.809 --> 01:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
conversations with Christian because I'm
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
not an actor okay so they could be
 
01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
predictive models there also could be
 
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
factors outside of a predictive model
 
01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
and so Christian will also look at
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
factors so it's not just that everybody
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
would file a predictive model that you
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
know that's becoming more popular but
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
there are also factors that are
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
considered in individual factors
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
considered and coming at a rate
 
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um so do
 
01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
do when when close close to the mic so
 
01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:21.380 align:start position:0%
represent kids sorry
 
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
so when
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
when Christian or whomever in the
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
department is looking working I don't
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
know yeah it's working okay good uh when
 
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
Christian or whoever in the apartment is
 
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
looking at this and the insurance
 
01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
company says is our secret sauce we want
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
it to be confidential
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
can he override that can he look at that
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
because I could see a world where they
 
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
just try to hide everything and I wonder
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
if he's able to look at like all right
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
this is fair this is actually
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
proprietary and this is them stretching
 
01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
to try to just keep it a little bit more
 
01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
black boxy okay so so for them for the
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
right to know and uh issue and my
 
01:08:59.209 --> 01:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
experience with that we've had
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
situations like that where you know you
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
might say this form is proprietary and
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
we might look at it and say yeah I don't
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
think so please explain to us why this
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
is proprietary we have had that back and
 
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
forth with our licensees and so it has
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
to pass the smell test and so we do do
 
01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
we do have those conversations we
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just automatically make it
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
public we would have a conversation with
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
our licensee so you're more than the
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
Spells a rubber stamp that's what you're
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
saying exactly
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah they could officially they can
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
disapprove it but they'll come back and
 
01:09:37.249 --> 01:09:37.259 align:start position:0%
say Okay show us your statistical
 
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
analysis to document what you you're
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
making that calculation on show us the
 
01:09:45.289 --> 01:09:45.299 align:start position:0%
evidence that you're making that on
 
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you uh the
 
01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
insurance department Christian or
 
01:09:53.329 --> 01:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
whoever does the evaluation has access
 
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
to this proprietary information so that
 
01:09:58.130 --> 01:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
he can determine whether there are any
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
discriminatory factors it's just that
 
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
it's not subject to the right to know
 
01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
law exactly thank you
 
01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:08.330 align:start position:0%
law exactly thank you

Jim you know
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
nobody else no okay all right we will
 
01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on Senate bill
 
01:10:21.780 --> 03:17:48.769 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on Senate bill
142.

03:17:48.769 --> 03:17:48.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:50.990 --> 03:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
and Senate Bill 198
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh uh and
 
03:17:59.510 --> 03:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:01.610 --> 03:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
excellent sorry I didn't notice you back
 
03:18:03.110 --> 03:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
there I would have started sooner but
 
03:18:05.690 --> 03:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
evidently there was a lot of sharing
 
03:18:07.070 --> 03:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
going on here
 
03:18:12.950 --> 03:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:14.929 --> 03:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
um good after
 
03:18:16.429 --> 03:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record I am
 
03:18:18.230 --> 03:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
Senator Rebecca Perkins quoka
 
03:18:20.690 --> 03:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
representing Senate District 21 the city
 
03:18:22.309 --> 03:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
of Portsmouth and several Seacoast
 
03:18:22.319 --> 03:18:23.389 align:start position:0%
of Portsmouth and several Seacoast
communities

03:18:23.389 --> 03:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:18:26.150 --> 03:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
SB 198 directing the insurance
 
03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
department to conduct a cost study of
 
03:18:30.410 --> 03:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
providing coverage for certain
 
03:18:31.969 --> 03:18:31.979 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care
 
03:18:33.950 --> 03:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
is a simple bill that could have a big
 
03:18:35.330 --> 03:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
impact for a lot of Granite State
 
03:18:35.340 --> 03:18:36.650 align:start position:0%
impact for a lot of Granite State
families

03:18:36.650 --> 03:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
families
 
03:18:38.809 --> 03:18:38.819 align:start position:0%
assisted reproductive treatment more
 
03:18:41.150 --> 03:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
commonly known as IVF is a pathway to
 
03:18:43.490 --> 03:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and the joys of a family that
 
03:18:45.230 --> 03:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
come with it for many people because
 
03:18:47.750 --> 03:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers however typically
 
03:18:50.570 --> 03:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
require a diagnosis of infertility in
 
03:18:52.969 --> 03:18:52.979 align:start position:0%
order to approve a claim same-sex
 
03:18:54.830 --> 03:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
families are finding that their claims
 
03:18:56.269 --> 03:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
are being denied
 
03:18:57.950 --> 03:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
this bill would direct the insurance
 
03:19:00.349 --> 03:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
department to take a simple first step
 
03:19:03.349 --> 03:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
of conducting a cost study on expanding
 
03:19:05.269 --> 03:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
group health insurance coverage for IVF
 
03:19:07.969 --> 03:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
without a diagnosis of infertility or at
 
03:19:09.530 --> 03:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
least a traditional one
 
03:19:11.690 --> 03:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
this bill is not a mandate and does not
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
create or change any existing insurance
 
03:19:16.309 --> 03:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
coverage it is simply directing the
 
03:19:18.889 --> 03:19:18.899 align:start position:0%
department to take a look at the cost of
 
03:19:20.809 --> 03:19:20.819 align:start position:0%
expanding this coverage and report back
 
03:19:22.429 --> 03:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
to the general court on their findings
 
03:19:24.410 --> 03:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to the Commissioner of
 
03:19:26.570 --> 03:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
Insurance on this bill and he is fine
 
03:19:27.910 --> 03:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
with it
 
03:19:31.130 --> 03:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
sb198 passed Senate Commerce unanimously
 
03:19:32.990 --> 03:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
and passed a full Senate on the consent
 
03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:33.830 align:start position:0%
and passed a full Senate on the consent
calendar

03:19:33.830 --> 03:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
and with that I am happy to answer any
 
03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:37.550 align:start position:0%
and with that I am happy to answer any
questions

03:19:37.550 --> 03:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
okay any questions representative
 
03:19:40.680 --> 03:19:42.349 align:start position:0%
okay any questions representative
Burroughs

03:19:42.349 --> 03:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
Burroughs
 
03:19:45.050 --> 03:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
one question I'm always concerned when I
 
03:19:47.750 --> 03:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
see a study or cost study are you
 
03:19:49.370 --> 03:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
concerned that this could be a study to
 
03:19:51.769 --> 03:19:51.779 align:start position:0%
know where or what would be what you
 
03:19:53.570 --> 03:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
hope would happen as a result of that
 
03:19:55.429 --> 03:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
sure sure thank you for the question
 
03:19:58.130 --> 03:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
representative so my personal hope is
 
03:20:00.950 --> 03:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
that the cost study would show that
 
03:20:03.290 --> 03:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
expanding this group health coverage is
 
03:20:06.110 --> 03:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
not that expensive for the carriers and
 
03:20:10.070 --> 03:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
so they would be open to revising their
 
03:20:12.590 --> 03:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
coverage to include
 
03:20:12.600 --> 03:20:13.570 align:start position:0%
coverage to include
um

03:20:13.570 --> 03:20:13.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:16.429 --> 03:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
IVF insurance coverage from the same
 
03:20:18.469 --> 03:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
stage as for heterosexual couples for
 
03:20:19.849 --> 03:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
same-sex couples
 
03:20:23.210 --> 03:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
so you do admit in the end of the day it
 
03:20:26.510 --> 03:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
is a mandate for insurance companies to
 
03:20:31.550 --> 03:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:34.250 --> 03:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
so we have to have the data to make
 
03:20:35.650 --> 03:20:35.660 align:start position:0%
exactly intriguing
 
03:20:39.110 --> 03:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
this is not a mandate well it is a
 
03:20:41.269 --> 03:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
mandate to the department for them to do
 
03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
a cost analysis correct to find out how
 
03:20:46.969 --> 03:20:46.979 align:start position:0%
much this is going to cost how much this
 
03:20:49.730 --> 03:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
mandate will cost if we were to
 
03:20:51.670 --> 03:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
implement it
 
03:20:55.010 --> 03:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
yes correct chair however that second
 
03:20:56.870 --> 03:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
step in that mandate is not in front of
 
03:20:58.550 --> 03:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
you once we have the data and what it
 
03:21:00.230 --> 03:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
would cost for that expansion then we
 
03:21:02.389 --> 03:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
could all consider whether the expansion
 
03:21:04.370 --> 03:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
and coverage was warranted or not right
 
03:21:08.150 --> 03:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
so in terms of doing a cost analysis
 
03:21:11.210 --> 03:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
how would the department do this is
 
03:21:13.670 --> 03:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
going to try to predict how many couples
 
03:21:13.680 --> 03:21:14.570 align:start position:0%
going to try to predict how many couples
May

03:21:14.570 --> 03:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
May
 
03:21:14.580 --> 03:21:16.969 align:start position:0%
May
chooses

03:21:16.969 --> 03:21:16.979 align:start position:0%
chooses
 
03:21:19.130 --> 03:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
are we supposed to do analysis of how
 
03:21:19.140 --> 03:21:19.969 align:start position:0%
are we supposed to do analysis of how
many

03:21:19.969 --> 03:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
many
 
03:21:23.330 --> 03:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
gay marriages are out there I mean what
 
03:21:25.070 --> 03:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
are what are they going to use for their
 
03:21:27.889 --> 03:21:27.899 align:start position:0%
calculating basis and to make this
 
03:21:29.630 --> 03:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
calculation how what are they going to
 
03:21:31.730 --> 03:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
be what kind of data are they going to
 
03:21:33.769 --> 03:21:33.779 align:start position:0%
be working from sure so there are
 
03:21:36.889 --> 03:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
fertility providers in New Hampshire
 
03:21:38.510 --> 03:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
um you know there's several and I have a
 
03:21:40.250 --> 03:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
couple of practitioners in this field
 
03:21:42.410 --> 03:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
that are here with me to testify and so
 
03:21:44.269 --> 03:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
they may be able to speak to this more
 
03:21:46.010 --> 03:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
accurately than I can but there's
 
03:21:47.809 --> 03:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
certainly data out there on same-sex
 
03:21:49.190 --> 03:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
couples that are seeking fertility
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
treatment and so I think the insurance
 
03:21:52.790 --> 03:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
department would probably look to that
 
03:21:54.950 --> 03:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:21:56.929 --> 03:21:56.939 align:start position:0%
and do we have any questions from the
 
03:21:59.570 --> 03:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
committee we do representative Burrows
 
03:22:01.550 --> 03:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my other question yes
 
03:22:03.710 --> 03:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is irrespective of
 
03:22:06.769 --> 03:22:06.779 align:start position:0%
cost do you believe that heterosexual
 
03:22:09.849 --> 03:22:09.859 align:start position:0%
couples and and um
 
03:22:11.990 --> 03:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
non-heterosexual couplers deserve the
 
03:22:14.870 --> 03:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:18.290 --> 03:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
I do and yeah so I just I figured you'd
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
say yes but I just even wonder why we
 
03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
need the cost study I mean it just seems
 
03:22:25.429 --> 03:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
like a basic right that everyone should
 
03:22:25.439 --> 03:22:26.510 align:start position:0%
like a basic right that everyone should
have

03:22:26.510 --> 03:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:22:28.010 --> 03:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
uh I would agree with your
 
03:22:29.690 --> 03:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
representative but I think
 
03:22:31.670 --> 03:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
um that in order to create some
 
03:22:33.410 --> 03:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
consensus or understanding around this
 
03:22:36.950 --> 03:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
issue that data is always helpful and so
 
03:22:36.960 --> 03:22:38.510 align:start position:0%
issue that data is always helpful and so
while

03:22:38.510 --> 03:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
while
 
03:22:38.520 --> 03:22:39.170 align:start position:0%
while
um

03:22:39.170 --> 03:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:41.210 --> 03:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
some coverage for same-sex couples
 
03:22:43.010 --> 03:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
exists in New Hampshire and the
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers will tell you that um
 
03:22:48.110 --> 03:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
you know same-sex couples do have
 
03:22:50.090 --> 03:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
separate procedures to qualify for
 
03:22:51.830 --> 03:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
fertility coverage for insurance and so
 
03:22:54.170 --> 03:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
I think ultimately we all want Happy
 
03:22:56.269 --> 03:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
thriving families in New Hampshire and
 
03:22:57.710 --> 03:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
so making sure we have enough
 
03:22:59.450 --> 03:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
information to make that successful is
 
03:22:59.460 --> 03:23:00.769 align:start position:0%
information to make that successful is
important

03:23:00.769 --> 03:23:00.779 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:23:03.830 --> 03:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
but I understand our infidelity coverage
 
03:23:06.889 --> 03:23:06.899 align:start position:0%
is only if you're have an infertility
 
03:23:06.899 --> 03:23:09.349 align:start position:0%
is only if you're have an infertility
issue

03:23:09.349 --> 03:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:23:11.510 --> 03:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
in this case they don't have an
 
03:23:16.510 --> 03:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:19.910 --> 03:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
then they would be covered if it that
 
03:23:22.550 --> 03:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
the only reason they're being rejected
 
03:23:25.910 --> 03:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
is that they're not doing it because of
 
03:23:25.920 --> 03:23:27.590 align:start position:0%
is that they're not doing it because of
infertility

03:23:27.590 --> 03:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
infertility
 
03:23:29.389 --> 03:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
they're doing it because the biology
 
03:23:31.250 --> 03:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't work right
 
03:23:34.729 --> 03:23:34.739 align:start position:0%
so if well what I'm saying is you're
 
03:23:38.630 --> 03:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
asking is does a a couple who are a
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:45.830 --> 03:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
they only can get this infertility
 
03:23:48.650 --> 03:23:48.660 align:start position:0%
coverage if one or the other
 
03:23:52.389 --> 03:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:55.550 --> 03:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
so as I'm saying this is that if if
 
03:23:58.429 --> 03:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to ask about if if in a in
 
03:24:01.610 --> 03:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
a gay couple relationship if one of them
 
03:24:03.950 --> 03:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
is infertile
 
03:24:06.469 --> 03:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
then theoretically they would be able to
 
03:24:10.370 --> 03:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
get this coverage under our current law
 
03:24:11.990 --> 03:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's probably a conversation for another
 
03:24:13.729 --> 03:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
day Mr chair but I would argue that
 
03:24:15.469 --> 03:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
same-sex couples are inherently
 
03:24:18.170 --> 03:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
infertile but that may be not the
 
03:24:19.849 --> 03:24:19.859 align:start position:0%
conversation of this though that's a
 
03:24:22.010 --> 03:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
biology question it's a biology question
 
03:24:22.020 --> 03:24:23.450 align:start position:0%
biology question it's a biology question
okay

03:24:23.450 --> 03:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:24:25.130 --> 03:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
representative Spears
 
03:24:27.590 --> 03:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
just as a clarification and I don't know
 
03:24:28.969 --> 03:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
exactly who would
 
03:24:30.889 --> 03:24:30.899 align:start position:0%
Aunt uh
 
03:24:34.429 --> 03:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
this kind of coverage I know with with
 
03:24:38.150 --> 03:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
Mike no no with my car I got to pick
 
03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
certain things that I wanted so this
 
03:24:42.349 --> 03:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a mandate for everyone it
 
03:24:45.170 --> 03:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
would be you would pick wooden is that
 
03:24:47.150 --> 03:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
true that you would just pick which
 
03:24:48.710 --> 03:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
coverage you wanted and if you were a
 
03:24:50.090 --> 03:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
gay couple and you felt this would be
 
03:24:51.769 --> 03:24:51.779 align:start position:0%
useful for you you would pick that it's
 
03:24:54.530 --> 03:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
not a mandate for everybody right
 
03:24:56.150 --> 03:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
um I I'm gonna let the practitioners
 
03:24:57.889 --> 03:24:57.899 align:start position:0%
behind me speak to that just because
 
03:25:00.170 --> 03:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
it's sort of how Insurance operates but
 
03:25:01.790 --> 03:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean you
 
03:25:03.650 --> 03:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
are still a customer of insurance
 
03:25:05.269 --> 03:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
companies and so you would still be
 
03:25:07.370 --> 03:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
electing for example family coverage but
 
03:25:08.990 --> 03:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think
 
03:25:11.389 --> 03:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
um what we're hoping the cost study
 
03:25:13.130 --> 03:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
reveals and what we suspect is the case
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
is that there's actually this is not
 
03:25:16.319 --> 03:25:17.150 align:start position:0%
is that there's actually this is not
um

03:25:17.150 --> 03:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:20.929 --> 03:25:20.939 align:start position:0%
a huge number of people and so the cost
 
03:25:23.030 --> 03:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
study hopefully will reveal that it's
 
03:25:25.250 --> 03:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
not a huge cost even if it were to be
 
03:25:28.070 --> 03:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
something that is underwritten by the
 
03:25:33.370 --> 03:25:33.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:35.450 --> 03:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
his hand up first
 
03:25:38.809 --> 03:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
uh thank you represent uh Senator thank
 
03:25:38.819 --> 03:25:40.030 align:start position:0%
uh thank you represent uh Senator thank
you

03:25:40.030 --> 03:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:25:42.590 --> 03:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of what or how much
 
03:25:47.690 --> 03:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost the insurance
 
03:25:51.410 --> 03:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
department to do this study
 
03:25:53.210 --> 03:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
there's no Financial node on it that's
 
03:25:55.550 --> 03:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
why I was asking that's true it did not
 
03:25:58.490 --> 03:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
get identified as an FN so again I've
 
03:26:01.130 --> 03:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to the commissioner and I I
 
03:26:02.870 --> 03:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
don't have information on that but I can
 
03:26:05.990 --> 03:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
just offer that he had no objections to
 
03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
including this and his work over the
 
03:26:10.429 --> 03:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
next year
 
03:26:13.010 --> 03:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you're on tape so we can quote
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
you on
 
03:26:17.809 --> 03:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:20.450 --> 03:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
I just have a question out of curiosity
 
03:26:20.460 --> 03:26:21.229 align:start position:0%
I just have a question out of curiosity
um

03:26:21.229 --> 03:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:25.070 --> 03:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
the definition of same-sex couple
 
03:26:27.830 --> 03:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
um I guess if you were transgender you
 
03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
could be considered a same-sex partner
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
um I am not an expert on how do you
 
03:26:36.650 --> 03:26:36.660 align:start position:0%
define same-sex couples yeah in today's
 
03:26:40.370 --> 03:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
parlance yes well
 
03:26:43.070 --> 03:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
um it's a good question representative I
 
03:26:44.690 --> 03:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
will let the practitioners behind me
 
03:26:46.670 --> 03:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
speak to how that affects this bill from
 
03:26:48.410 --> 03:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
a practical standpoint
 
03:26:50.389 --> 03:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it's defined in law
 
03:26:52.370 --> 03:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
or whether you know this would be sort
 
03:26:55.610 --> 03:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
of the only language concerning that
 
03:26:56.929 --> 03:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:26:56.939 --> 03:26:58.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

03:26:58.070 --> 03:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:27:01.250 --> 03:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
okay representative purcelli I noticed
 
03:27:03.590 --> 03:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for letting me ask the
 
03:27:06.290 --> 03:27:06.300 align:start position:0%
question I I notice it also says end
 
03:27:08.750 --> 03:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
single individual so doesn't that really
 
03:27:10.550 --> 03:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
open it up to
 
03:27:13.429 --> 03:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
everyone and anyone so I'm not sure how
 
03:27:13.439 --> 03:27:14.870 align:start position:0%
everyone and anyone so I'm not sure how
to

03:27:14.870 --> 03:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:27:16.910 --> 03:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
conduct this study
 
03:27:19.010 --> 03:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
I mean it it
 
03:27:21.950 --> 03:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
says single individuals
 
03:27:24.590 --> 03:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
yes that's a good point and so you know
 
03:27:27.110 --> 03:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
again the intent is to
 
03:27:30.050 --> 03:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
make sure that our insurance coverage is
 
03:27:32.090 --> 03:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
treating everyone equally
 
03:27:33.590 --> 03:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
um and so again I think I'm probably
 
03:27:34.790 --> 03:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
going to defer your question if you
 
03:27:36.410 --> 03:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
don't mind to the practitioners just to
 
03:27:38.210 --> 03:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
make sure I answer it accurately thank
 
03:27:38.220 --> 03:27:43.130 align:start position:0%
make sure I answer it accurately thank
you

03:27:43.130 --> 03:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:44.750 --> 03:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
03:27:44.760 --> 03:27:54.410 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
committee

03:27:54.410 --> 03:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:56.090 --> 03:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
you said oh there's somebody else you
 
03:27:57.950 --> 03:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak yeah yeah sorry we we
 
03:28:02.090 --> 03:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
ask you to fill out a pink card okay why
 
03:28:03.229 --> 03:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
don't you fill out the pink card and
 
03:28:06.290 --> 03:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
I'll have uh uh Alex Palma will come up
 
03:28:17.809 --> 03:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:20.769 --> 03:28:20.779 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Alex felvable
 
03:28:23.150 --> 03:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
insurance company examiner for the
 
03:28:25.309 --> 03:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
03:28:27.050 --> 03:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:28:27.060 --> 03:28:27.710 align:start position:0%
um and
um

03:28:27.710 --> 03:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:31.729 --> 03:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
as Senator Cuoco mentioned the
 
03:28:35.090 --> 03:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
commissioner would be happy to arrange
 
03:28:38.330 --> 03:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
for the study that this bill
 
03:28:38.340 --> 03:28:39.250 align:start position:0%
for the study that this bill
um

03:28:39.250 --> 03:28:39.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:42.349 --> 03:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
calls for if it's the pleasure of the
 
03:28:45.710 --> 03:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
committee to have that move forward but
 
03:28:48.229 --> 03:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
we do request uh we have basically a
 
03:28:51.469 --> 03:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
procedural request there is already a
 
03:28:53.269 --> 03:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
statute on the books
 
03:28:59.450 --> 03:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
um RSA 400a 39b that provides that any
 
03:29:01.130 --> 03:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
standing committee of the House of the
 
03:29:04.190 --> 03:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
senate in when considering a proposed
 
03:29:08.690 --> 03:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
mandate has the authority to refer that
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
bill to the commissioner who then has
 
03:29:15.410 --> 03:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
the authority to retain an external
 
03:29:19.130 --> 03:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
reviewer or an Actuarial firm to conduct
 
03:29:21.729 --> 03:29:21.739 align:start position:0%
a study of the costs and the benefits
 
03:29:25.010 --> 03:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
of that proposed mandate and we would
 
03:29:28.510 --> 03:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
prefer to use that that procedure
 
03:29:31.610 --> 03:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
so what that would mean was was that
 
03:29:34.729 --> 03:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
this committee would just take a vote to
 
03:29:34.739 --> 03:29:36.010 align:start position:0%
this committee would just take a vote to
refer

03:29:36.010 --> 03:29:36.020 align:start position:0%
refer
 
03:29:39.050 --> 03:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
the the review as specified in the
 
03:29:40.929 --> 03:29:40.939 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
 
03:29:44.030 --> 03:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner under that statute
 
03:29:48.830 --> 03:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
400 a colon 39- small B
 
03:29:52.790 --> 03:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
um and we do have an actual reform on
 
03:29:56.030 --> 03:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
retainer and it's in our budget we
 
03:29:58.790 --> 03:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
usually end up conducting one or two of
 
03:30:01.849 --> 03:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
these studies every year they cost on
 
03:30:03.610 --> 03:30:03.620 align:start position:0%
average around fifteen thousand dollars
 
03:30:07.309 --> 03:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
to conduct and the actual firm does have
 
03:30:07.319 --> 03:30:08.830 align:start position:0%
to conduct and the actual firm does have
to

03:30:08.830 --> 03:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:30:13.150 --> 03:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
make estimates of some of the questions
 
03:30:16.010 --> 03:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
that were raised by this committee how
 
03:30:18.950 --> 03:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
many people are likely to
 
03:30:18.960 --> 03:30:19.849 align:start position:0%
many people are likely to
um

03:30:19.849 --> 03:30:19.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:22.370 --> 03:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the services that we
 
03:30:25.670 --> 03:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
newly available and then they would also
 
03:30:28.130 --> 03:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
have to estimate the cost of those
 
03:30:29.929 --> 03:30:29.939 align:start position:0%
services and the frequency of the
 
03:30:32.450 --> 03:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
services in order to come with come up
 
03:30:36.590 --> 03:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:38.929 --> 03:30:38.939 align:start position:0%
okay representative Burroughs thank you
 
03:30:40.370 --> 03:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions so just to
 
03:30:43.849 --> 03:30:43.859 align:start position:0%
understand over here sorry
 
03:30:48.769 --> 03:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
um so given 400a so what so you know do
 
03:30:50.750 --> 03:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
not need a bill to do that it just needs
 
03:30:53.389 --> 03:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
to be a request yeah it's okay A little
 
03:30:53.399 --> 03:30:54.349 align:start position:0%
to be a request yeah it's okay A little
bit

03:30:54.349 --> 03:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
bit
 
03:30:54.359 --> 03:30:55.070 align:start position:0%
bit
um

03:30:55.070 --> 03:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:57.590 --> 03:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
unusual you need a bill that's being
 
03:30:59.510 --> 03:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
considered which you have
 
03:31:01.190 --> 03:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
but as long as there's a bill under
 
03:31:04.610 --> 03:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
consideration then the proposed the
 
03:31:08.030 --> 03:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
contemplated mandate you just need we
 
03:31:10.250 --> 03:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
need a committee vote to refer it to the
 
03:31:11.929 --> 03:31:11.939 align:start position:0%
insurance department and that's all we
 
03:31:13.250 --> 03:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
need to move forward
 
03:31:16.269 --> 03:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
follow up do we need an amendment
 
03:31:18.710 --> 03:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
I generally call this the the Lismore
 
03:31:21.889 --> 03:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth Murphy who is the lobbyist who
 
03:31:24.769 --> 03:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
had this bill put in and so I call this
 
03:31:28.010 --> 03:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
the Murphy Law and uh it and the Murphy
 
03:31:31.250 --> 03:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
Law was that the committee rather than
 
03:31:33.650 --> 03:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of if it would normally
 
03:31:35.570 --> 03:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
either retain or interim study the bill
 
03:31:38.990 --> 03:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
and that in the meantime uh the request
 
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
that the department takes the language
 
03:31:44.990 --> 03:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's in the bill as written right and
 
03:31:46.670 --> 03:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
that's very important so they're not
 
03:31:48.950 --> 03:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
going to add any other variables to the
 
03:31:50.450 --> 03:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
store subject they're going to be
 
03:31:52.370 --> 03:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
looking at just the way the bill is
 
03:31:55.250 --> 03:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
written and do a cost analysis of what
 
03:31:56.990 --> 03:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
that mandate might require be right
 
03:31:59.330 --> 03:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
because right
 
03:32:03.349 --> 03:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you uh in
 
03:32:05.809 --> 03:32:05.819 align:start position:0%
terms of figuring out how many people
 
03:32:08.809 --> 03:32:08.819 align:start position:0%
would be requesting this coverage am I
 
03:32:11.690 --> 03:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
right in understanding that there are
 
03:32:11.700 --> 03:32:12.790 align:start position:0%
right in understanding that there are
records

03:32:12.790 --> 03:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
records
 
03:32:18.290 --> 03:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
existing out there of same-sex same sex
 
03:32:20.990 --> 03:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
couples and single people who are
 
03:32:23.809 --> 03:32:23.819 align:start position:0%
seeking fertility treatment or have
 
03:32:25.790 --> 03:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
sought fertility treatment in the last
 
03:32:28.309 --> 03:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:28.319 --> 03:32:29.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:32:29.389 --> 03:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:33.650 --> 03:32:33.660 align:start position:0%
the most common records that I'm used to
 
03:32:35.330 --> 03:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
dealing with are
 
03:32:38.690 --> 03:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
um claims files so their claims that
 
03:32:40.790 --> 03:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
have been made to insurance carriers in
 
03:32:42.290 --> 03:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
this case
 
03:32:46.550 --> 03:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
um some of the services occurring may be
 
03:32:50.090 --> 03:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
self-pay and I think it would take a
 
03:32:51.950 --> 03:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
little more digging for this for an
 
03:32:55.670 --> 03:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
actual firm to get a hold of those that
 
03:32:58.070 --> 03:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
kind of information
 
03:33:00.349 --> 03:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up for the question you may
 
03:33:03.170 --> 03:33:03.180 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you uh
 
03:33:05.570 --> 03:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
but will it be possible to obtain this
 
03:33:09.469 --> 03:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
information and a sufficient numbers to
 
03:33:11.990 --> 03:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
make a reasonably accurate estimate
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
I believe so yeah that's the whole
 
03:33:17.510 --> 03:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
essence of Actuarial science is to use
 
03:33:21.070 --> 03:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
available data to make best possible
 
03:33:25.070 --> 03:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
estimates and this is not an unusual
 
03:33:27.469 --> 03:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
kind of mandate to be evaluating thank
 
03:33:27.479 --> 03:33:30.050 align:start position:0%
kind of mandate to be evaluating thank
you

03:33:30.050 --> 03:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:32.929 --> 03:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
oh representative field
 
03:33:35.090 --> 03:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
because you're are any other states
 
03:33:37.849 --> 03:33:37.859 align:start position:0%
currently mandating coverage for uh
 
03:33:40.070 --> 03:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
fertility coverage for same-sex couples
 
03:33:42.110 --> 03:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know maybe some of the other
 
03:33:42.120 --> 03:33:43.610 align:start position:0%
I don't know maybe some of the other
Advocates

03:33:43.610 --> 03:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
Advocates
 
03:33:45.950 --> 03:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
um would be aware of that
 
03:33:47.870 --> 03:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I would say that infertility
 
03:33:49.910 --> 03:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
coverage is relatively new for New
 
03:33:52.969 --> 03:33:52.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we only passed it in the last
 
03:33:54.530 --> 03:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
couple of years so
 
03:33:57.469 --> 03:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
it's five years five years yeah the
 
03:33:59.210 --> 03:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
scheme of mandates the scheme of things
 
03:33:59.220 --> 03:34:00.170 align:start position:0%
scheme of mandates the scheme of things
yeah

03:34:00.170 --> 03:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:34:02.630 --> 03:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
03:34:05.210 --> 03:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:34:09.170 --> 03:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
all right so we now have another card
 
03:34:13.550 --> 03:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:16.010 --> 03:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
you look familiar I feel like we've met
 
03:34:16.020 --> 03:34:17.510 align:start position:0%
you look familiar I feel like we've met
before

03:34:17.510 --> 03:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:34:17.520 --> 03:34:19.750 align:start position:0%
before
okay

03:34:19.750 --> 03:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:34:22.210 --> 03:34:22.220 align:start position:0%
save four years
 
03:34:25.550 --> 03:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for um the committee's support
 
03:34:26.809 --> 03:34:26.819 align:start position:0%
of that particular Bill my name is
 
03:34:26.819 --> 03:34:30.710 align:start position:0%
of that particular Bill my name is
Catherine

03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:32.990 --> 03:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
and I have an exclusively a fertility
 
03:34:35.690 --> 03:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
law practice so I deal with a lot of
 
03:34:39.550 --> 03:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
folks who are undergoing IVF and also
 
03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
artificial insemination and other terms
 
03:34:44.690 --> 03:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
other types of fertility treatment and
 
03:34:46.370 --> 03:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
the bill that went through this
 
03:34:48.290 --> 03:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
committee four years ago was limited to
 
03:34:50.510 --> 03:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
Medical infertility so basically when
 
03:34:52.370 --> 03:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
there's a medical problem like myself
 
03:34:53.750 --> 03:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
and my husband we had medical problems
 
03:34:55.250 --> 03:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of medical problems egg
 
03:34:57.469 --> 03:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
sperm uterus all bad
 
03:35:00.590 --> 03:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
um so we you know we were lucky that we
 
03:35:02.450 --> 03:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
were able to get coverage through my
 
03:35:04.670 --> 03:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
state employment at the time
 
03:35:07.610 --> 03:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
um but there's still a gap of people
 
03:35:09.650 --> 03:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
what we call social infertility which is
 
03:35:11.269 --> 03:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
folks who don't have a partner they can
 
03:35:13.910 --> 03:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
reproduce with for whatever reason
 
03:35:15.229 --> 03:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
um whether they be single whether they
 
03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
be in a same-sex relationship and in
 
03:35:19.790 --> 03:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
terms of transgender folks this
 
03:35:21.590 --> 03:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
depending on the relationship status
 
03:35:22.610 --> 03:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
they're either going to fall under
 
03:35:24.830 --> 03:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
medical infertility or social
 
03:35:26.450 --> 03:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
infertility so we'd have to look at that
 
03:35:29.510 --> 03:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
to make a determination for them but
 
03:35:29.520 --> 03:35:30.229 align:start position:0%
to make a determination for them but
um

03:35:30.229 --> 03:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:32.450 --> 03:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that these folks need
 
03:35:34.309 --> 03:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
fertility treatment just as much as
 
03:35:36.410 --> 03:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
everybody else does and they're paying
 
03:35:37.790 --> 03:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
their premiums and they're not getting
 
03:35:41.330 --> 03:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
the coverage they a same-sex couple can
 
03:35:44.330 --> 03:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
become medically infertile if there it
 
03:35:46.370 --> 03:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
turns out to be a problem but they first
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
have to try treatment on their own at
 
03:35:50.809 --> 03:35:50.819 align:start position:0%
their own expense in order to even find
 
03:35:53.150 --> 03:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
out that there's a problem
 
03:35:55.490 --> 03:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
um Maine is currently the only state I'm
 
03:35:58.790 --> 03:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
aware of that provides full coverage for
 
03:36:00.769 --> 03:36:00.779 align:start position:0%
both social infertility and medical
 
03:36:02.570 --> 03:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
infertility there might be a couple
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
others but it's going to be a very small
 
03:36:06.110 --> 03:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
number it's generally a medical
 
03:36:07.969 --> 03:36:07.979 align:start position:0%
infertility is what the laws have been
 
03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
looking at and the reason we did that is
 
03:36:13.790 --> 03:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
because we at the time only had cost
 
03:36:16.729 --> 03:36:16.739 align:start position:0%
data for this medical infertility we
 
03:36:18.050 --> 03:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
didn't know what the costs were going to
 
03:36:20.090 --> 03:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
be for social infertility we want to get
 
03:36:22.010 --> 03:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
that data so we can examine what our
 
03:36:24.050 --> 03:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
options are and not necessarily we're
 
03:36:26.030 --> 03:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
not necessarily talking about a mandate
 
03:36:28.550 --> 03:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
here one option that was brought up in
 
03:36:31.429 --> 03:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
the Senate was possibly having a rider
 
03:36:34.250 --> 03:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
or an acquire the insurance company to
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
offer the option to purchase a rider for
 
03:36:39.170 --> 03:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
coverage so
 
03:36:41.150 --> 03:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
it you know there's there's various
 
03:36:42.950 --> 03:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
options we don't know exactly what makes
 
03:36:44.090 --> 03:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
sense for the people of New Hampshire
 
03:36:46.250 --> 03:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
without having more information on the
 
03:36:48.950 --> 03:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
costs and this particular cost study
 
03:36:51.410 --> 03:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done it was supposed to be
 
03:36:54.830 --> 03:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
done in Maine but that didn't happen for
 
03:36:55.990 --> 03:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
whatever reason the insurance
 
03:36:58.269 --> 03:36:58.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner did not do a full
 
03:37:02.269 --> 03:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
scientific actual Actuarial analysis and
 
03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
so the really can't rely on the
 
03:37:06.170 --> 03:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
conclusions that came from Maine what we
 
03:37:10.610 --> 03:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
do know from prior research is that the
 
03:37:12.650 --> 03:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
it yes there is initial cost for
 
03:37:14.870 --> 03:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
fertility treatment but patients make
 
03:37:16.910 --> 03:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
better choices in their fertility
 
03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
treatment if they have insurance
 
03:37:21.769 --> 03:37:21.779 align:start position:0%
coverage and that results in fewer twin
 
03:37:23.929 --> 03:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
and triplet pregnancies which are
 
03:37:27.170 --> 03:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
astronomically expensive one cycle of
 
03:37:29.809 --> 03:37:29.819 align:start position:0%
IVF paying for that is always going to
 
03:37:31.130 --> 03:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
be cheaper than paying for triplet
 
03:37:34.010 --> 03:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and so what we see now is a
 
03:37:35.809 --> 03:37:35.819 align:start position:0%
lot of same-sex couples it's on their
 
03:37:37.790 --> 03:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
own diet they're making decisions that
 
03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
are not ideal female couples may be
 
03:37:42.110 --> 03:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
taking ovulation drugs in addition to
 
03:37:44.210 --> 03:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
doing an artificial insemination which
 
03:37:45.769 --> 03:37:45.779 align:start position:0%
is you know that's that's how you end up
 
03:37:48.469 --> 03:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
with triplets nowadays male couples
 
03:37:49.969 --> 03:37:49.979 align:start position:0%
they're obviously you know they're doing
 
03:37:52.550 --> 03:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
an egg donor and a surrogate and the
 
03:37:53.929 --> 03:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
male couples they all they always come
 
03:37:56.210 --> 03:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
wanting you know we want a child that is
 
03:37:58.429 --> 03:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
we each want a genetic chat twins
 
03:38:00.349 --> 03:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
transfer to umbrellas let's have twins
 
03:38:02.990 --> 03:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
well you know those costs get
 
03:38:04.790 --> 03:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
astronomical too when those pregnancies
 
03:38:06.469 --> 03:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
get complicated and those pregnancy
 
03:38:08.510 --> 03:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
complications are going to be covered by
 
03:38:10.610 --> 03:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
insurance and when the children are born
 
03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
prematurely there's going to be NICU
 
03:38:15.110 --> 03:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
costs and then if they have long-term
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
side effects there's going to be
 
03:38:19.969 --> 03:38:19.979 align:start position:0%
long-term medical expenses so the way to
 
03:38:22.610 --> 03:38:22.620 align:start position:0%
address this is give the insurance
 
03:38:25.309 --> 03:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
companies the leeway to impose best
 
03:38:27.650 --> 03:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
practices for patients who are getting
 
03:38:30.110 --> 03:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
coverage and so what we actually expect
 
03:38:31.969 --> 03:38:31.979 align:start position:0%
that we expect that the cost to be
 
03:38:34.070 --> 03:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
relatively small and that it's actually
 
03:38:36.950 --> 03:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
going to be offset by the savings from
 
03:38:38.690 --> 03:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
not having these complicated pregnancies
 
03:38:41.570 --> 03:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
involving NICU time and Lifetime Medical
 
03:38:41.580 --> 03:38:43.070 align:start position:0%
involving NICU time and Lifetime Medical
Care

03:38:43.070 --> 03:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
Care
 
03:38:44.750 --> 03:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
um if this is purely we're looking at
 
03:38:46.429 --> 03:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
medical costs we're not looking at the
 
03:38:48.769 --> 03:38:48.779 align:start position:0%
cost of a surrogate or the costs an egg
 
03:38:51.110 --> 03:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
donor just purely the medical costs for
 
03:38:53.269 --> 03:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
getting those eggs getting the sperm
 
03:38:55.190 --> 03:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
mixing them together
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
putting them in a a person to get
 
03:38:58.080 --> 03:38:59.389 align:start position:0%
putting them in a a person to get
pregnant

03:38:59.389 --> 03:38:59.399 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
03:38:59.399 --> 03:39:00.110 align:start position:0%
pregnant
um

03:39:00.110 --> 03:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
and it's really just a matter of equity
 
03:39:04.250 --> 03:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
these couples are paying their premiums
 
03:39:05.870 --> 03:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
and they need fertility treatment they
 
03:39:07.370 --> 03:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
may not need the fertility treatment for
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
the same reason my husband and I did but
 
03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
they still need it and so it's important
 
03:39:13.550 --> 03:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
that we you know we figure we look at
 
03:39:15.710 --> 03:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
these costs and then we get creative and
 
03:39:17.389 --> 03:39:17.399 align:start position:0%
think about you know how we can make
 
03:39:19.790 --> 03:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
this you know how we can make expand
 
03:39:21.889 --> 03:39:21.899 align:start position:0%
coverage for the people of the State of
 
03:39:25.070 --> 03:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:26.490 --> 03:39:26.500 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
03:39:30.050 --> 03:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:39:32.809 --> 03:39:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:35.210 --> 03:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
my question is can an insurance company
 
03:39:37.370 --> 03:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
I know it's a company it's a you know
 
03:39:38.690 --> 03:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
it's many people
 
03:39:40.490 --> 03:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
decline coverage because of their
 
03:39:43.490 --> 03:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
wow I I you know I think that that's
 
03:39:47.450 --> 03:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
going to be an issue that is going to be
 
03:39:49.250 --> 03:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
coming before the U.S Supreme Court at
 
03:39:50.929 --> 03:39:50.939 align:start position:0%
some point in the next few years and
 
03:39:52.309 --> 03:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
then we will have more answers on that
 
03:39:55.070 --> 03:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure right now and I'm not aware
 
03:39:57.170 --> 03:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
of any case decisions from the New
 
03:39:59.510 --> 03:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court on point either
 
03:39:59.520 --> 03:40:01.010 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court on point either
thanks

03:40:01.010 --> 03:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
03:40:04.130 --> 03:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
03:40:06.950 --> 03:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
not sure how to put this in the uh way
 
03:40:08.750 --> 03:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
of a question I feel like I'm a Jeopardy
 
03:40:11.929 --> 03:40:11.939 align:start position:0%
now so it better be uh would I be
 
03:40:13.250 --> 03:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
accurate if you just say would you
 
03:40:15.170 --> 03:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
please would you believe that the The
 
03:40:17.269 --> 03:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
Hobby Lobby case which uh concerned
 
03:40:19.429 --> 03:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
abortion said that an employer-based
 
03:40:21.889 --> 03:40:21.899 align:start position:0%
Insurance Fund
 
03:40:24.889 --> 03:40:24.899 align:start position:0%
would be able to deny uh coverage for
 
03:40:29.389 --> 03:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
example uh for abortion based on uh the
 
03:40:32.210 --> 03:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
employer's religious beliefs so it is
 
03:40:36.050 --> 03:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
possible that that similar line of logic
 
03:40:39.530 --> 03:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
could apply to this uh type of coverage
 
03:40:41.690 --> 03:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
as well would you believe yeah and I
 
03:40:43.309 --> 03:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
also I want to clarify for everybody to
 
03:40:45.050 --> 03:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
make sure you all understand this
 
03:40:47.929 --> 03:40:47.939 align:start position:0%
legislation will only affect small
 
03:40:47.939 --> 03:40:49.670 align:start position:0%
legislation will only affect small
employers

03:40:49.670 --> 03:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
employers
 
03:40:54.349 --> 03:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
so large employers who risk a plans to
 
03:40:56.450 --> 03:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
State health insurance plan it will not
 
03:41:00.290 --> 03:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
affect unless they choose to also mirror
 
03:41:03.410 --> 03:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
it but this legislation and if we were
 
03:41:06.110 --> 03:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
to be in effect would only affect small
 
03:41:06.120 --> 03:41:07.429 align:start position:0%
to be in effect would only affect small
employers

03:41:07.429 --> 03:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
employers
 
03:41:09.610 --> 03:41:09.620 align:start position:0%
and I don't know
 
03:41:12.309 --> 03:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
whether it would affect the individual
 
03:41:14.990 --> 03:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
it theoretically it could not be under
 
03:41:16.910 --> 03:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
the Affordable Care Act because that's
 
03:41:19.309 --> 03:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
an expanded mandate that did not exist
 
03:41:22.429 --> 03:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
when the Act was created so it would not
 
03:41:25.190 --> 03:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
include those individuals either
 
03:41:28.670 --> 03:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:30.590 --> 03:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:41:32.630 --> 03:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh our questions
 
03:41:34.490 --> 03:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
so you said a term that I had never
 
03:41:36.050 --> 03:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
heard before and I want to make sure I
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
understand it so that the next time I
 
03:41:40.130 --> 03:41:40.140 align:start position:0%
hear it I know what it means you said
 
03:41:43.010 --> 03:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
social infertility and I was wondering
 
03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
if you could explain what social
 
03:41:47.389 --> 03:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
infertility means and does it involve
 
03:41:50.090 --> 03:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
someone of the opposite sex to be
 
03:41:52.670 --> 03:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
fertile with or explain how that works
 
03:41:55.490 --> 03:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
exactly so so if if your social
 
03:41:57.530 --> 03:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
infertility is that you you don't have a
 
03:41:59.870 --> 03:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
medical problem but there's still some
 
03:42:01.370 --> 03:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
reason that you need fertility treatment
 
03:42:04.010 --> 03:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
for example because you're a woman who's
 
03:42:05.570 --> 03:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
in a relationship with another woman
 
03:42:07.370 --> 03:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
that would be an example or if you're a
 
03:42:09.110 --> 03:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
single woman who is not in a
 
03:42:10.729 --> 03:42:10.739 align:start position:0%
relationship with anyone and wants to
 
03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
become a single parent by choice so that
 
03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
would be social infertility and they go
 
03:42:17.150 --> 03:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
through the exact same treatments that
 
03:42:19.849 --> 03:42:19.859 align:start position:0%
people undergoing medical infertility go
 
03:42:21.229 --> 03:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
through they need the exact same
 
03:42:23.210 --> 03:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
treatments the exact same tests the
 
03:42:24.889 --> 03:42:24.899 align:start position:0%
exact same screening the exact same
 
03:42:31.330 --> 03:42:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:35.150 --> 03:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
so I just saw him clear a same-sex
 
03:42:38.929 --> 03:42:38.939 align:start position:0%
couple is socially infertile
 
03:42:44.450 --> 03:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
some point that's typically when they so
 
03:42:48.170 --> 03:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
let's say we have a female couple
 
03:42:49.490 --> 03:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
they're going to start with artificial
 
03:42:51.710 --> 03:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
insemination which is placement of
 
03:42:54.650 --> 03:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
Frozen sperm thawed and placed into one
 
03:42:56.690 --> 03:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
of the women's uteruses if that doesn't
 
03:42:58.309 --> 03:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
work after a certain number of times
 
03:42:59.809 --> 03:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
then the doctors are going to start
 
03:43:01.070 --> 03:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
thinking you know what there's something
 
03:43:03.110 --> 03:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
medically wrong here and we can then
 
03:43:04.610 --> 03:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
transition them into the world of
 
03:43:06.830 --> 03:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
medical infertility at which point they
 
03:43:08.990 --> 03:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
would have coverage under the current
 
03:43:10.610 --> 03:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
law all right thanks for clearing that
 
03:43:10.620 --> 03:43:12.530 align:start position:0%
law all right thanks for clearing that
up

03:43:12.530 --> 03:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:43:17.450 --> 03:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:20.330 --> 03:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
no I have no more cards anybody else
 
03:43:22.849 --> 03:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
want to testify seeing none we close the
 
03:44:19.550 --> 03:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:22.510 --> 03:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
we must be moving right along right
 
03:44:25.550 --> 03:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
140. yeah look at that
 
03:44:26.929 --> 03:44:26.939 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:44:29.990 --> 03:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 235 and representative
 
03:44:32.570 --> 03:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
Senator Chanley is here good afternoon

03:44:43.729 --> 03:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and good afternoon
 
03:44:47.150 --> 03:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee my
 
03:44:49.849 --> 03:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
name is Shannon chandley and I represent
 
03:44:52.729 --> 03:44:52.739 align:start position:0%
Senate District 11 which includes the
 
03:44:55.969 --> 03:44:55.979 align:start position:0%
towns of Amherst Milford Merrimack and
 
03:44:58.729 --> 03:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
Wilton I'm pleased to be here before you
 
03:45:03.050 --> 03:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
today to introduce Senate Bill 235 which
 
03:45:05.450 --> 03:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
is relative to Services provided through
 
03:45:10.670 --> 03:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
a primary care behavioral health model
 
03:45:13.670 --> 03:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
um I'll start out and I I know that I
 
03:45:17.330 --> 03:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
probably do not need to tell you how
 
03:45:20.210 --> 03:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
desperately New Hampshire and the rest
 
03:45:23.870 --> 03:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
of the country uh the crisis that we are
 
03:45:27.650 --> 03:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
facing regarding mental uh illness and
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
treatment for to achieve mental health
 
03:45:31.680 --> 03:45:32.809 align:start position:0%
treatment for to achieve mental health
um

03:45:32.809 --> 03:45:32.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
we know that tens of thousands of
 
03:45:37.849 --> 03:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
granite Staters experience mental
 
03:45:40.750 --> 03:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
illness including depression
 
03:45:43.969 --> 03:45:43.979 align:start position:0%
anxiety and self-harm
 
03:45:47.210 --> 03:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
we've had I believe the most recent
 
03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
statistics are that
 
03:45:49.560 --> 03:45:50.349 align:start position:0%
statistics are that
um

03:45:50.349 --> 03:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:55.130 --> 03:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
279 people died last year by Suicide and
 
03:45:58.010 --> 03:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
we know that many others consid have
 
03:46:01.370 --> 03:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation as well as other forms
 
03:46:02.889 --> 03:46:02.899 align:start position:0%
of self-harm
 
03:46:05.750 --> 03:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
access to mental health care as you know
 
03:46:09.410 --> 03:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
is extremely difficult and is often if
 
03:46:11.630 --> 03:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
not most often
 
03:46:11.640 --> 03:46:12.670 align:start position:0%
not most often
um

03:46:12.670 --> 03:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:15.050 --> 03:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
achieved through primary health care
 
03:46:17.929 --> 03:46:17.939 align:start position:0%
provider the primary care behavioral
 
03:46:20.630 --> 03:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
health model is an integrated model that
 
03:46:22.670 --> 03:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
is designed to allow psychologists to
 
03:46:25.250 --> 03:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
work collaboratively with primary care
 
03:46:28.610 --> 03:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
providers to deliver mental health care
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
to patients
 
03:46:31.680 --> 03:46:32.929 align:start position:0%
to patients
um

03:46:32.929 --> 03:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:36.769 --> 03:46:36.779 align:start position:0%
SB 235 is designed so that Mental Health
 
03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
Care Services uh
 
03:46:42.650 --> 03:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
delivered through this method will not
 
03:46:46.370 --> 03:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
be denied on the basis of the delivery
 
03:46:49.010 --> 03:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
by their insurance companies
 
03:46:51.889 --> 03:46:51.899 align:start position:0%
so I can just if we want to look just
 
03:46:53.690 --> 03:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
briefly at the bill
 
03:46:56.870 --> 03:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
um I can just say that uh the first bit
 
03:46:59.809 --> 03:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
of the bill deals with um it's a
 
03:47:01.969 --> 03:47:01.979 align:start position:0%
statement regarding the landscape in
 
03:47:04.790 --> 03:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
which this bill is being introduced it
 
03:47:06.650 --> 03:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
it covers some of the issues which I
 
03:47:09.250 --> 03:47:09.260 align:start position:0%
have mentioned um the prevalence of
 
03:47:11.929 --> 03:47:11.939 align:start position:0%
mental health concerns the difficulty
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
with delivery of mental health care
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
services and
 
03:47:18.650 --> 03:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
um the insurance landscape then we move
 
03:47:20.630 --> 03:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
on to some definitions regarding
 
03:47:24.889 --> 03:47:24.899 align:start position:0%
insurers and care and then sections
 
03:47:27.950 --> 03:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
Roman one through four are really the
 
03:47:29.870 --> 03:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
heart of the matter
 
03:47:31.490 --> 03:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
um you know with a few standard
 
03:47:33.429 --> 03:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place
 
03:47:37.370 --> 03:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh made a small Amendment and
 
03:47:39.590 --> 03:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
that is found in uh
 
03:47:44.090 --> 03:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
section four of Romans section 4 number
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
four was an Amendment added by the
 
03:47:49.250 --> 03:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
Senate um which I think is really very
 
03:47:51.290 --> 03:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
important to do
 
03:47:53.570 --> 03:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I can answer any questions you may
 
03:47:56.750 --> 03:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
have but I really urge you to listen to
 
03:47:59.750 --> 03:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
the folks who are here to talk about
 
03:48:03.110 --> 03:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
um the this delivery system of Health
 
03:48:05.210 --> 03:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
Care in practice and I'm sure you will
 
03:48:07.010 --> 03:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
hear also from some of the folks in the
 
03:48:10.010 --> 03:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
insurance industry and um I can assure
 
03:48:11.929 --> 03:48:11.939 align:start position:0%
you that there has been a lot of work
 
03:48:14.750 --> 03:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
going on prior to this bill being
 
03:48:17.809 --> 03:48:17.819 align:start position:0%
introduced and continuing right up until
 
03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
today in terms of finding the best way
 
03:48:22.969 --> 03:48:22.979 align:start position:0%
that we can address the situation in our
 
03:48:27.830 --> 03:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:30.170 --> 03:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
I guess the only question I make sure I
 
03:48:33.590 --> 03:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
understand so this is a whole new way to
 
03:48:36.290 --> 03:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
run the mental health benefit is that
 
03:48:38.990 --> 03:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
definitely under current law it is
 
03:48:41.330 --> 03:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
different it cannot it is taking place
 
03:48:44.330 --> 03:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
it is occurring right now but the bill
 
03:48:46.729 --> 03:48:46.739 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that
 
03:48:49.309 --> 03:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
um Mental Health Coverage cannot be
 
03:48:52.190 --> 03:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
denied solely on the basis of the
 
03:48:54.530 --> 03:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
delivery method which is a psychologist
 
03:48:57.469 --> 03:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
in consultation with primary care
 
03:49:01.070 --> 03:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
so the issue is that
 
03:49:03.229 --> 03:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
um some insurance companies are allowing
 
03:49:05.330 --> 03:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
this now yes
 
03:49:10.250 --> 03:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
and the concern is that uh we want to
 
03:49:14.389 --> 03:49:14.399 align:start position:0%
say that that an insurance company
 
03:49:18.290 --> 03:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
can't say no to this plan
 
03:49:20.990 --> 03:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
that they can't say oh we we have we
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
have this old model the model we've
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
always used and you can they can't say
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
so what as a free market goes what
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with a company saying we do
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
cover this in another company say we
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
don't cover this so what what's wrong
 
03:49:38.990 --> 03:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
with letting that insurance companies
 
03:49:42.050 --> 03:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
be public or be used as a marketing tool
 
03:49:43.969 --> 03:49:43.979 align:start position:0%
to sign up for that insurance company
 
03:49:46.610 --> 03:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
based upon whether they use this method
 
03:49:49.610 --> 03:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
or not well I I think that there's a lot
 
03:49:52.490 --> 03:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
in that question that goes beyond
 
03:49:52.500 --> 03:49:53.269 align:start position:0%
in that question that goes beyond
um

03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:55.729 --> 03:49:55.739 align:start position:0%
this bill uh
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
what I would say is that we we always P
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
03:50:05.210 --> 03:50:05.220 align:start position:0%
probably a newer model
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
um an effective model and again I'll let
 
03:50:09.290 --> 03:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
folks who can testify to that better
 
03:50:11.990 --> 03:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
than I discuss the specifics of the
 
03:50:15.950 --> 03:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
model we do we do require certain
 
03:50:18.110 --> 03:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
coverage we we've done that as a state
 
03:50:20.210 --> 03:50:20.220 align:start position:0%
we have required insurers to cover
 
03:50:20.220 --> 03:50:21.710 align:start position:0%
we have required insurers to cover
certain

03:50:21.710 --> 03:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
certain
 
03:50:21.720 --> 03:50:22.630 align:start position:0%
certain
um

03:50:22.630 --> 03:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:25.729 --> 03:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
uh certain procedures certain processes
 
03:50:28.969 --> 03:50:28.979 align:start position:0%
this is one of them and I think that
 
03:50:31.670 --> 03:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
um this is the way we can best serve our
 
03:50:32.929 --> 03:50:32.939 align:start position:0%
constituents and the people of the
 
03:50:36.170 --> 03:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
Granite State because people ha are
 
03:50:38.809 --> 03:50:38.819 align:start position:0%
there just aren't enough mental health
 
03:50:41.630 --> 03:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
care providers in our state for us to
 
03:50:44.870 --> 03:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
expect that everyone can go to
 
03:50:49.010 --> 03:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
um an uh mental health care provider in
 
03:50:51.650 --> 03:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
individual practice this is a way for
 
03:50:54.110 --> 03:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
the primary care provider and the
 
03:50:57.590 --> 03:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Home Health Care Home of
 
03:51:00.530 --> 03:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
the patient for that that patient to
 
03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
access Mental Health Care through that
 
03:51:06.349 --> 03:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
system and I think that us require
 
03:51:09.110 --> 03:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
saying now if if an insurance company
 
03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover a certain kind of um
 
03:51:15.370 --> 03:51:15.380 align:start position:0%
well they have to cover mental health
 
03:51:18.650 --> 03:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
but have parity law but if there are
 
03:51:21.410 --> 03:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
things that they do not cover we cannot
 
03:51:23.809 --> 03:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
force them to cover them we are simply
 
03:51:26.929 --> 03:51:26.939 align:start position:0%
saying that this is a denial of coverage
 
03:51:31.010 --> 03:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
cannot be solely on the basis of the
 
03:51:33.170 --> 03:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
delivery system the primary care
 
03:51:36.290 --> 03:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health System okay so is that
 
03:51:38.269 --> 03:51:38.279 align:start position:0%
an assumption that that this method is
 
03:51:40.969 --> 03:51:40.979 align:start position:0%
more expensive than oh current procedure
 
03:51:43.010 --> 03:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
no I would I would suggest that it
 
03:51:45.950 --> 03:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
probably is um significantly more more
 
03:51:47.510 --> 03:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
affordable but again I'll let people
 
03:51:49.790 --> 03:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
have we found any insurance companies
 
03:51:51.650 --> 03:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
have rejected it
 
03:51:54.110 --> 03:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
my understanding from the folks that
 
03:51:55.849 --> 03:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
I've talked to is yes
 
03:52:00.710 --> 03:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
but again I'm I ca I will let uh the
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
people who have been
 
03:52:05.030 --> 03:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies maybe address
 
03:52:07.370 --> 03:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
that themselves to say what the
 
03:52:09.170 --> 03:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
conversations we've had
 
03:52:12.170 --> 03:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
it's not so much I've heard from some
 
03:52:14.570 --> 03:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
folks that this has not been covered
 
03:52:16.610 --> 03:52:16.620 align:start position:0%
I've also heard from insurance companies
 
03:52:18.229 --> 03:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
that they're they're kind of on board
 
03:52:21.110 --> 03:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
with it in theory and I think you'll
 
03:52:22.969 --> 03:52:22.979 align:start position:0%
hear some of that today
 
03:52:25.429 --> 03:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
okay great if you have any questions
 
03:52:28.550 --> 03:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative Calabro
 
03:52:32.349 --> 03:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
it's a would you believe sure
 
03:52:36.349 --> 03:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
having worked in exactly that model it
 
03:52:39.170 --> 03:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
is far less expensive I am a QA medical
 
03:52:41.809 --> 03:52:41.819 align:start position:0%
lead at Harvard care so I had all those
 
03:52:43.490 --> 03:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
horrifics John it is a much less
 
03:52:45.889 --> 03:52:45.899 align:start position:0%
expensive model and it saves lives
 
03:52:48.590 --> 03:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
but so I'm just saying if it's if it's
 
03:52:51.170 --> 03:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
less expensive yeah I'm surprised any
 
03:52:52.969 --> 03:52:52.979 align:start position:0%
insurance company's not doing it fair
 
03:52:57.469 --> 03:52:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:59.510 --> 03:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
but we don't need a mandate if they know
 
03:53:02.650 --> 03:53:02.660 align:start position:0%
that they must have a reason yeah okay
 
03:53:05.870 --> 03:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative patusek has a question
 
03:53:08.809 --> 03:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
oh representative Gibbs
 
03:53:11.630 --> 03:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
03:53:13.849 --> 03:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
03:53:13.859 --> 03:53:14.510 align:start position:0%
in terms of
um

03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:14.520 --> 03:53:16.969 align:start position:0%
um
uh

03:53:16.969 --> 03:53:16.979 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:53:20.330 --> 03:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
the marketing model that representative
 
03:53:23.570 --> 03:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
hunt uh was referring to
 
03:53:25.190 --> 03:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
um and you know he makes a good point
 
03:53:27.410 --> 03:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
about the free market
 
03:53:31.070 --> 03:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
um in the free market in insurance but
 
03:53:33.469 --> 03:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
03:53:37.630 --> 03:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
um is it often possible for insurance
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
consumers uh to shop around among
 
03:53:44.990 --> 03:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
insurance companies at the time when
 
03:53:47.389 --> 03:53:47.399 align:start position:0%
they need mental health coverage
 
03:53:50.690 --> 03:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
no they can't no thank you I I that's a
 
03:53:53.809 --> 03:53:53.819 align:start position:0%
very good point Ray that I did um
 
03:53:55.370 --> 03:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
I take your point
 
03:53:55.380 --> 03:53:56.030 align:start position:0%
I take your point
um

03:53:56.030 --> 03:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
we aren't we can have a free market but
 
03:54:01.910 --> 03:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
we also once we have agreed to a
 
03:54:08.469 --> 03:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:11.210 --> 03:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
for the small business there's a annual
 
03:54:13.910 --> 03:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
renewal and for the individual there's a
 
03:54:17.150 --> 03:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
renewal twice a year so you uh follow-up
 
03:54:20.150 --> 03:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
question so yes go ahead um
 
03:54:24.050 --> 03:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
if I am an employee of a small business
 
03:54:27.050 --> 03:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
um that is in between renewable periods
 
03:54:29.570 --> 03:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
and I find that I need mental health
 
03:54:32.150 --> 03:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
coverage but
 
03:54:35.090 --> 03:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
will be best able to obtain it through
 
03:54:38.630 --> 03:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
the primary care model uh will I be able
 
03:54:40.910 --> 03:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
to change insurance companies
 
03:54:44.389 --> 03:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:44.399 --> 03:54:48.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:54:48.309 --> 03:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:50.809 --> 03:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator would you say that
 
03:54:52.490 --> 03:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's true that it's the job of the
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
legislature of the state to do what is
 
03:54:55.790 --> 03:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
best for the state and the mental health
 
03:54:57.650 --> 03:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
citizen mental health of the citizens of
 
03:55:00.110 --> 03:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
the state yes
 
03:55:03.950 --> 03:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
we are we have had several bills in our
 
03:55:05.570 --> 03:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
Senate this year as I'm sure you've had
 
03:55:08.570 --> 03:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
in the house recognizing the crisis that
 
03:55:10.490 --> 03:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
we're in and trying to figure out the
 
03:55:13.309 --> 03:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
best way for us to meet the needs of our
 
03:55:13.319 --> 03:55:15.410 align:start position:0%
best way for us to meet the needs of our
citizens

03:55:15.410 --> 03:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
03:55:19.849 --> 03:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:22.450 --> 03:55:22.460 align:start position:0%
the model as I thank you for the
 
03:55:25.250 --> 03:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
allowing me to ask the question uh the
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
model that we're talking about
 
03:55:30.830 --> 03:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
the patient would see their primary care
 
03:55:32.510 --> 03:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
and the primary care would do the
 
03:55:34.130 --> 03:55:34.140 align:start position:0%
initial screening
 
03:55:37.250 --> 03:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
and the assumption is that there is a
 
03:55:39.590 --> 03:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
mental health professional associated
 
03:55:41.809 --> 03:55:41.819 align:start position:0%
with that practice that could then take
 
03:55:43.790 --> 03:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
over the care if it if it's needed to do
 
03:55:45.889 --> 03:55:45.899 align:start position:0%
that yes care would be delivered in
 
03:55:48.170 --> 03:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
consultation with
 
03:55:50.689 --> 03:55:50.699 align:start position:0%
um the psychologists and I think that um
 
03:55:52.550 --> 03:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from a couple of people who
 
03:55:55.309 --> 03:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
are working in this type of practice uh
 
03:55:57.530 --> 03:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
follow on just a short for the question
 
03:55:59.689 --> 03:55:59.699 align:start position:0%
so the question I have is I know that
 
03:56:02.030 --> 03:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult it's it is pretty
 
03:56:03.530 --> 03:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
difficult to get to a mental health
 
03:56:06.290 --> 03:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
professional today without long Waits
 
03:56:07.790 --> 03:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
and all the rest of the things that
 
03:56:10.729 --> 03:56:10.739 align:start position:0%
we've been reading about so in this
 
03:56:10.739 --> 03:56:12.070 align:start position:0%
we've been reading about so in this
model

03:56:12.070 --> 03:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
model
 
03:56:14.809 --> 03:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
do people you see it's it's a question
 
03:56:16.790 --> 03:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
of knowing in advance that you need to
 
03:56:18.650 --> 03:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
be involved with a practice
 
03:56:20.570 --> 03:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
that can get you to the mental health
 
03:56:22.490 --> 03:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
that you need mental health care that
 
03:56:24.769 --> 03:56:24.779 align:start position:0%
you need so is it any more difficult to
 
03:56:26.750 --> 03:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
get to these kinds of practices than it
 
03:56:28.250 --> 03:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
is to get to
 
03:56:30.530 --> 03:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh you know going directly to a mental
 
03:56:32.090 --> 03:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
health profession
 
03:56:32.100 --> 03:56:33.349 align:start position:0%
health profession
um

03:56:33.349 --> 03:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:36.290 --> 03:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
I do not know if it's any harder to get
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
into a primary care provider who works
 
03:56:44.269 --> 03:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
in this collaborative model or not
 
03:56:45.950 --> 03:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
that would be a good question for
 
03:56:47.570 --> 03:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
perhaps one of the folks who is working
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
in that model
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
so so this is not for all primary care
 
03:56:54.050 --> 03:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
physicians this is It's a model it has
 
03:56:56.450 --> 03:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
nothing primary care physician no
 
03:56:58.610 --> 03:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
nothing in this legislation would
 
03:57:01.490 --> 03:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
require that a primary care physician
 
03:57:04.250 --> 03:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
participate in this kind of model but it
 
03:57:06.349 --> 03:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
would certainly be available to any who
 
03:57:07.490 --> 03:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
chose to
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
but do so there's no requirement of any
 
03:57:13.130 --> 03:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
special training or any special uh extra
 
03:57:15.790 --> 03:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
courses they have to take or CEUs not to
 
03:57:19.010 --> 03:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
qualify not to my marriage but Primary
 
03:57:20.389 --> 03:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
Care would be working with the
 
03:57:20.399 --> 03:57:21.830 align:start position:0%
Care would be working with the
psychologist

03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
psychologist
 
03:57:24.650 --> 03:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
interesting Mr Mr chairman I understand
 
03:57:26.090 --> 03:57:26.100 align:start position:0%
the collaborative but I've just had
 
03:57:28.550 --> 03:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
normally when we when we had third party
 
03:57:31.550 --> 03:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
insurance is that it we we rely on the
 
03:57:34.429 --> 03:57:34.439 align:start position:0%
people's category of what they are so in
 
03:57:36.170 --> 03:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
other words I guess some nurse
 
03:57:36.180 --> 03:57:38.090 align:start position:0%
other words I guess some nurse
practitioner

03:57:38.090 --> 03:57:38.100 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
03:57:41.150 --> 03:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
is a primary care physician so that any
 
03:57:43.790 --> 03:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner could participate in
 
03:57:46.070 --> 03:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
this program and there is just about
 
03:57:47.990 --> 03:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
whether their willingness
 
03:57:50.330 --> 03:57:50.340 align:start position:0%
to then work with
 
03:57:55.490 --> 03:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:55.500 --> 03:57:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:57:59.269 --> 03:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
that's I just we're learning here
 
03:58:01.969 --> 03:58:01.979 align:start position:0%
learning we're learning yes we just like
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
to remind us all that the senator
 
03:58:06.349 --> 03:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
pointed out that the
 
03:58:09.790 --> 03:58:09.800 align:start position:0%
bill was amended prior to passage
 
03:58:12.469 --> 03:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
indicating in response to the question
 
03:58:15.170 --> 03:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
must all Primary Care Providers provide
 
03:58:18.050 --> 03:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
such a model in fact the language States
 
03:58:20.150 --> 03:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
nothing in this actual mandate that a
 
03:58:21.650 --> 03:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
primary care physician follow the
 
03:58:24.590 --> 03:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
primary care behavioral health model the
 
03:58:26.990 --> 03:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
actual only mandate insurance coverage
 
03:58:29.269 --> 03:58:29.279 align:start position:0%
of such care if a primary care provider
 
03:58:31.309 --> 03:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
were to choose to use the model so
 
03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
therefore it's optional right but the
 
03:58:36.290 --> 03:58:36.300 align:start position:0%
point I was trying to make was is that
 
03:58:40.189 --> 03:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
is that the whole issue is how do we who
 
03:58:41.809 --> 03:58:41.819 align:start position:0%
who qualifies and who doesn't qualify
 
03:58:45.290 --> 03:58:45.300 align:start position:0%
that so therefore the gatekeeper here is
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
that primary care physician and they
 
03:58:51.889 --> 03:58:51.899 align:start position:0%
would say is no I I don't want to
 
03:58:55.090 --> 03:58:55.100 align:start position:0%
participate in this and therefore
 
03:58:58.790 --> 03:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
therefore the whole concept that this is
 
03:59:00.830 --> 03:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
a great option might fall flat on its
 
03:59:03.050 --> 03:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
face if no primary care physician well
 
03:59:05.590 --> 03:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
only 100 of them said no
 
03:59:10.370 --> 03:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
well no I last time I checked we have a
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
hard time finding primary care
 
03:59:14.750 --> 03:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
physicians and a lot of them are moving
 
03:59:17.510 --> 03:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
on and a lot of family practices don't
 
03:59:21.650 --> 03:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
have and so now you you've basically uh
 
03:59:24.349 --> 03:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
never mind would you believe I'm a
 
03:59:26.570 --> 03:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
little concerned whether the primary
 
03:59:29.090 --> 03:59:29.100 align:start position:0%
whether somebody chooses chooses to do
 
03:59:30.830 --> 03:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
this whether they would be very
 
03:59:32.990 --> 03:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
disappointed if they find out that their
 
03:59:35.570 --> 03:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
primary care physician is unwilling to
 
03:59:38.389 --> 03:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
participate and so therefore they might
 
03:59:40.370 --> 03:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
be shopping their primary care physician
 
03:59:44.689 --> 03:59:44.699 align:start position:0%
after a mental health event is occurred
 
03:59:46.670 --> 03:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
that is my concern
 
03:59:46.680 --> 03:59:48.290 align:start position:0%
that is my concern
okay

03:59:48.290 --> 03:59:48.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:59:48.300 --> 03:59:50.090 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

03:59:50.090 --> 03:59:50.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:59:51.650 --> 03:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you senator for
 
03:59:53.389 --> 03:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
taking our questions I'm trying to get
 
03:59:55.910 --> 03:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
my head around the recent uh a few
 
03:59:57.410 --> 03:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
questions representative Superior
 
03:59:57.420 --> 03:59:58.490 align:start position:0%
questions representative Superior
started

03:59:58.490 --> 03:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
started
 
04:00:01.729 --> 04:00:01.739 align:start position:0%
um if I had if I felt I needed mental
 
04:00:02.809 --> 04:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
health care
 
04:00:04.849 --> 04:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
through this behavioral health model I
 
04:00:07.309 --> 04:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
couldn't go directly to a psychiatrist
 
04:00:09.650 --> 04:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
or a psychologist is that right
 
04:00:12.170 --> 04:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
let's say this bill passes
 
04:00:13.969 --> 04:00:13.979 align:start position:0%
that would not be that would not be
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
covered through
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
am I understanding that correctly
 
04:00:21.769 --> 04:00:21.779 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not entirely clear on your
 
04:00:23.870 --> 04:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
question like can you just so restate it
 
04:00:25.130 --> 04:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
for me there's like the traditional
 
04:00:27.110 --> 04:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
mental health model where you go to a
 
04:00:30.170 --> 04:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist or a psychologist directly
 
04:00:31.969 --> 04:00:31.979 align:start position:0%
because you don't need to go through
 
04:00:33.650 --> 04:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
your primary to get permission this is
 
04:00:35.150 --> 04:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
so you go to a mental health this is
 
04:00:37.389 --> 04:00:37.399 align:start position:0%
just dealing with the behavioral model
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
so the primary care behavioral health
 
04:00:43.189 --> 04:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
model would allow for you to access
 
04:00:46.309 --> 04:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
mental the services of a psychologist
 
04:00:49.010 --> 04:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
through your primary care provider but I
 
04:00:51.050 --> 04:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
couldn't go directly to my well you
 
04:00:52.729 --> 04:00:52.739 align:start position:0%
might be able to it wouldn't prevent you
 
04:00:54.469 --> 04:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
from necessarily doing that it wouldn't
 
04:00:56.210 --> 04:00:56.220 align:start position:0%
be mandated that the insurance could
 
04:00:57.410 --> 04:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
cover it
 
04:00:59.570 --> 04:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
no and I but I think that most people
 
04:00:59.580 --> 04:01:00.889 align:start position:0%
no and I but I think that most people
the

04:01:00.889 --> 04:01:00.899 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
that isn't a problem that most people
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
are facing right now the problem people
 
04:01:08.090 --> 04:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
are facing is finding and accessing
 
04:01:10.910 --> 04:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
mental health care services this helps
 
04:01:14.210 --> 04:01:14.220 align:start position:0%
to widen uh the availability of Mental
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
Health Services to more patients and I'd
 
04:01:21.170 --> 04:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
also say that many you know just to
 
04:01:24.650 --> 04:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
touch bring us back a little bit many
 
04:01:27.650 --> 04:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Providers are already most
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
many people who access mental health
 
04:01:32.330 --> 04:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
care services do so through their
 
04:01:35.929 --> 04:01:35.939 align:start position:0%
primary care provider this gives the
 
04:01:38.990 --> 04:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
primary care provider an option to
 
04:01:40.809 --> 04:01:40.819 align:start position:0%
consult with
 
04:01:42.830 --> 04:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
psychologists as part of the
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
collaborative program
 
04:01:48.050 --> 04:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
okay so when you say through the
 
04:01:50.630 --> 04:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
provider there's a mental health
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
professional on the other side of that
 
04:01:54.290 --> 04:01:54.300 align:start position:0%
relationship what is what does through
 
04:01:56.750 --> 04:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
mean yes and I really do think that
 
04:01:59.570 --> 04:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
you'll you know similar to the con most
 
04:02:01.550 --> 04:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
of other conditions where you go to the
 
04:02:03.830 --> 04:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
primary and the primary says I need to
 
04:02:07.130 --> 04:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
allow you to go to a specialist so in
 
04:02:09.889 --> 04:02:09.899 align:start position:0%
this case there's still there you know
 
04:02:11.689 --> 04:02:11.699 align:start position:0%
you call them a gatekeeper but they're
 
04:02:13.729 --> 04:02:13.739 align:start position:0%
still the person who is then giving the
 
04:02:16.189 --> 04:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation who they should go to for
 
04:02:20.689 --> 04:02:20.699 align:start position:0%
the follow-ups thank you so okay uh
 
04:02:23.210 --> 04:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
representative Terry so so I understand
 
04:02:25.610 --> 04:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
that really we're we're approaching this
 
04:02:27.650 --> 04:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
from the insurance
 
04:02:29.929 --> 04:02:29.939 align:start position:0%
yes that's why Direction because we
 
04:02:31.729 --> 04:02:31.739 align:start position:0%
already know that doctors talk to
 
04:02:34.429 --> 04:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
doctors correct all the time and refer
 
04:02:36.530 --> 04:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
to doctors and doctors refer back to the
 
04:02:38.210 --> 04:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
doctor so this is this is about
 
04:02:41.170 --> 04:02:41.180 align:start position:0%
insurance just so that we get yeah
 
04:02:43.490 --> 04:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for that
 
04:02:47.450 --> 04:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
question it'll just this is the
 
04:02:49.870 --> 04:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
greatest premise of this bill is that
 
04:02:53.090 --> 04:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
insurance companies cannot deny coverage
 
04:02:58.849 --> 04:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:01.010 --> 04:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gibbs
 
04:03:04.010 --> 04:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and again I have two
 
04:03:06.170 --> 04:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
questions but they're quick ones uh I
 
04:03:06.180 --> 04:03:06.830 align:start position:0%
questions but they're quick ones uh I
hope

04:03:06.830 --> 04:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
hope
 
04:03:10.969 --> 04:03:10.979 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of going directly to a
 
04:03:12.650 --> 04:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist for mental health treatment
 
04:03:14.689 --> 04:03:14.699 align:start position:0%
if you can find one that is taking new
 
04:03:14.699 --> 04:03:16.070 align:start position:0%
if you can find one that is taking new
patients

04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
patients
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
um isn't it correct that current
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
insurance requirements already require
 
04:03:24.349 --> 04:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
coverage of mental health treatment by a
 
04:03:24.359 --> 04:03:26.510 align:start position:0%
coverage of mental health treatment by a
psychiatrist

04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist
 
04:03:29.769 --> 04:03:29.779 align:start position:0%
in general in general
 
04:03:32.809 --> 04:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
current uh
 
04:03:36.010 --> 04:03:36.020 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage
 
04:03:38.269 --> 04:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
does need to cover mental health
 
04:03:41.389 --> 04:03:41.399 align:start position:0%
treatment by an authorized provider
 
04:03:43.610 --> 04:03:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you and then the second question
 
04:03:43.620 --> 04:03:45.530 align:start position:0%
thank you and then the second question
is

04:03:45.530 --> 04:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:03:47.630 --> 04:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
um essentially would you believe uh
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
based on personal experience of recently
 
04:03:54.290 --> 04:03:54.300 align:start position:0%
um having had to find new providers uh
 
04:03:57.170 --> 04:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
that while I don't know about
 
04:04:00.229 --> 04:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
um uh primary care physicians involved
 
04:04:02.090 --> 04:04:02.100 align:start position:0%
in the kind of collaborative practice
 
04:04:05.150 --> 04:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
that you're describing uh would you
 
04:04:08.689 --> 04:04:08.699 align:start position:0%
believe that it is considerably easier
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
um to find a primary care physician that
 
04:04:14.570 --> 04:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
is taking new patients than it is to
 
04:04:16.610 --> 04:04:16.620 align:start position:0%
find a psychiatrist who is taking new
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%

three-fold because I just moved here and

I'm feeling it

04:07:12.349 --> 04:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
I get called in
 
04:07:15.469 --> 04:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
I can spend more time with that patient
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
and I hope that you support this SB
 
04:07:22.849 --> 04:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
oh and now I don't have the the name the
 
04:07:25.670 --> 04:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
number in my head 2 3 or 235 because
 
04:07:28.670 --> 04:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
what it's going to do is ensure that
 
04:07:30.349 --> 04:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
insurance companies continue to support
 
04:07:32.210 --> 04:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
this model in a way that makes it
 
04:07:35.030 --> 04:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
sustainable it is not supported all the
 
04:07:37.070 --> 04:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
billing codes are not supported in every
 
04:07:40.729 --> 04:07:40.739 align:start position:0%
state you get to make a change and I
 
04:07:43.010 --> 04:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
want to give you a specific example of
 
04:07:44.570 --> 04:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
how this works
 
04:07:46.610 --> 04:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
I do this every day
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
and I love what I do because I know I
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
make a difference this morning I saw two
 
04:07:54.050 --> 04:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
patients with panic attacks of in my
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
case load this morning it's something I
 
04:07:59.090 --> 04:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
do regularly and untreated panic attacks
 
04:08:00.530 --> 04:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
often end up in the emergency room
 
04:08:02.330 --> 04:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
because people think they're having a
 
04:08:03.469 --> 04:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
heart attack that's what the symptoms
 
04:08:05.870 --> 04:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
feel like and that comes with a great
 
04:08:05.880 --> 04:08:07.070 align:start position:0%
feel like and that comes with a great
cost

04:08:07.070 --> 04:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:08:09.050 --> 04:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
patient goes sometimes one two three
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
times but and they're discharged from
 
04:08:12.050 --> 04:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
the emergency room they're saying hey go
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
back and see your primary care provider
 
04:08:15.950 --> 04:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
and hopefully that primary care provider
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
has an embedded psychologist inside that
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
process or inside their system because
 
04:08:23.389 --> 04:08:23.399 align:start position:0%
what I can do is go in in 20 minutes
 
04:08:24.889 --> 04:08:24.899 align:start position:0%
when they come in to see that primary
 
04:08:27.290 --> 04:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
care provider and I can help a patient
 
04:08:27.300 --> 04:08:28.670 align:start position:0%
care provider and I can help a patient
understand

04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:08:32.210 --> 04:08:32.220 align:start position:0%
what a panic attack is because and I
 
04:08:33.469 --> 04:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
won't go into the full explanation you
 
04:08:35.269 --> 04:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
won't give me that much time today but a
 
04:08:37.490 --> 04:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
panic attack is your body's healthy way
 
04:08:39.469 --> 04:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
of responding to a threat or stressor
 
04:08:41.689 --> 04:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
and if you become fearful to those
 
04:08:44.330 --> 04:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
bodily Sensations that happen when your
 
04:08:46.490 --> 04:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
body goes into fight or flight it's fear
 
04:08:48.050 --> 04:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
of your fight or flight response that's
 
04:08:49.969 --> 04:08:49.979 align:start position:0%
actually the panic attack
 
04:08:51.889 --> 04:08:51.899 align:start position:0%
but if you keep fearing it it just keeps
 
04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
turning it on it gets worse if I can go
 
04:08:55.790 --> 04:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
in in those 20 minutes and help that
 
04:08:58.490 --> 04:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
patient understand those symptoms they
 
04:09:00.769 --> 04:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
stop having panic attacks they are not
 
04:09:03.290 --> 04:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
back at the ER the next week
 
04:09:06.590 --> 04:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
so having embedded psychologists
 
04:09:08.929 --> 04:09:08.939 align:start position:0%
immediately changes the outcome for that
 
04:09:08.939 --> 04:09:09.950 align:start position:0%
immediately changes the outcome for that
patient

04:09:09.950 --> 04:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
because they're not having panic attacks
 
04:09:14.330 --> 04:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
it decreases the overall cost of care
 
04:09:16.010 --> 04:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
because they're not going to the under
 
04:09:17.990 --> 04:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
the emergency room and they're not over
 
04:09:20.269 --> 04:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
utilizing unnecessarily they don't mean
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
to the emergency room
 
04:09:24.650 --> 04:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
that then can focus on people who might
 
04:09:26.090 --> 04:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
be dying
 
04:09:27.530 --> 04:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
because you won't die from a panic
 
04:09:30.110 --> 04:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
attack and all the providers involved
 
04:09:32.150 --> 04:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
that weren't really helping get rid of
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
the panic attack they end up with
 
04:09:33.840 --> 04:09:34.969 align:start position:0%
the panic attack they end up with
burnout

04:09:34.969 --> 04:09:34.979 align:start position:0%
burnout
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
so having embedded psychologists with a
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
sustainable job are a sustainable job
 
04:09:42.650 --> 04:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
because of finances by you supporting
 
04:09:44.809 --> 04:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
this bill you're going to allow for the
 
04:09:47.150 --> 04:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
people in the state of New Hampshire to
 
04:09:48.229 --> 04:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
be able to get behavioral health
 
04:09:50.630 --> 04:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
treatment when they need it
 
04:09:52.670 --> 04:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
in a place that they're comfortable in
 
04:09:54.830 --> 04:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
their Primary Care office
 
04:09:56.570 --> 04:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
and you're going to decrease the cost of
 
04:09:56.580 --> 04:09:57.710 align:start position:0%
and you're going to decrease the cost of
care

04:09:57.710 --> 04:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
care
 
04:09:59.330 --> 04:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
and you're going to decrease provider
 
04:10:01.309 --> 04:10:01.319 align:start position:0%
burnout in our state
 
04:10:03.769 --> 04:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
so thank you I will answer any questions
 
04:10:06.410 --> 04:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
you might have about this
 
04:10:08.330 --> 04:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs
 
04:10:09.950 --> 04:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you this is more curiosity
 
04:10:09.960 --> 04:10:11.210 align:start position:0%
thank you this is more curiosity
question

04:10:11.210 --> 04:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:10:13.550 --> 04:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
um can you treat these panic attacks
 
04:10:16.250 --> 04:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
with medications so that you know there
 
04:10:18.830 --> 04:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be extended therapy for
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:24.720 --> 04:10:27.410 align:start position:0%
 
diazepam

04:10:27.410 --> 04:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
as a peanut does because you're you know
 
04:10:30.830 --> 04:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
I haven't explained the mechanism and
 
04:10:32.990 --> 04:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't have time but when you fear it and
 
04:10:34.490 --> 04:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
you take a benzo to immediately make
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
those symptoms go away you have now
 
04:10:37.729 --> 04:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
reinforced that there was something
 
04:10:39.290 --> 04:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
really bad there and this medication is
 
04:10:40.429 --> 04:10:40.439 align:start position:0%
going to make it better and you're in
 
04:10:41.389 --> 04:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
this ongoing relationship with
 
04:10:43.809 --> 04:10:43.819 align:start position:0%
benzodiazepine which over time loses its
 
04:10:46.490 --> 04:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness become dependent on it and
 
04:10:48.349 --> 04:10:48.359 align:start position:0%
you have more and more panic attacks and
 
04:10:49.670 --> 04:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
because now you're having panic attacks
 
04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
they generalize and they get bigger over
 
04:10:53.450 --> 04:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
time and the person's life gets smaller
 
04:10:56.330 --> 04:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes people become housebound
 
04:10:58.910 --> 04:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that answer having an
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
embedded psychologist that can provide
 
04:11:03.229 --> 04:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
that information is key and I train the
 
04:11:05.750 --> 04:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
Physicians I work with to know that and
 
04:11:07.309 --> 04:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
they go out into the world I can speak
 
04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
from experience with us they end up
 
04:11:10.429 --> 04:11:10.439 align:start position:0%
going because they're doing their
 
04:11:12.410 --> 04:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
training in an emergency room and then
 
04:11:13.670 --> 04:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
they share that with the emergency room
 
04:11:15.290 --> 04:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
docs and then they stop using benzos
 
04:11:16.729 --> 04:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
because they now know that's going to
 
04:11:18.050 --> 04:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
make it worse for their patients in the
 
04:11:19.849 --> 04:11:19.859 align:start position:0%
long run
 
04:11:22.010 --> 04:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
I thought they used Xanax
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
that's a benzodia SP I'm talking about a
 
04:11:26.090 --> 04:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
category of medications that's the
 
04:11:29.870 --> 04:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:29.880 --> 04:11:31.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:11:31.750 --> 04:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you for
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
04:11:39.530 --> 04:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
um this sounds like
 
04:11:39.540 --> 04:11:42.410 align:start position:0%
um this sounds like
um

04:11:42.410 --> 04:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:45.830 --> 04:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
they'll be many more physicians primary
 
04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
care physicians and psychologists going
 
04:11:50.330 --> 04:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
into the field because they know that
 
04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
now that they can partner up yeah let's
 
04:11:55.250 --> 04:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
say primary care and to relieve
 
04:12:00.769 --> 04:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
um some workload or just expand their
 
04:12:03.950 --> 04:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
ability to treat patients in many ways
 
04:12:06.170 --> 04:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
absolutely when a patient comes in and
 
04:12:08.030 --> 04:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
is suicidal and the primary care
 
04:12:10.189 --> 04:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
physician has 20 minutes to do
 
04:12:11.389 --> 04:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
everything they were supposed to do with
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
that patient and because we have picked
 
04:12:15.130 --> 04:12:15.140 align:start position:0%
up suicide
 
04:12:17.689 --> 04:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
suicidality we can't say oh put that on
 
04:12:18.889 --> 04:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
hold we'll see that at the next visit
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
that becomes a primary thing I'll get
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
called in and start working working with
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
that patient and if I can't get them a
 
04:12:27.050 --> 04:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
safety plan to get them home and get
 
04:12:28.910 --> 04:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
them into the right level of care or if
 
04:12:30.530 --> 04:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
need be get them hospitalized which can
 
04:12:32.450 --> 04:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
take up to three hours in my old system
 
04:12:33.650 --> 04:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
where I could walk them across the
 
04:12:35.450 --> 04:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
street and hospitalize them here that's
 
04:12:38.030 --> 04:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
a whole nother issue
 
04:12:40.130 --> 04:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
um so it keeps the primary care
 
04:12:42.710 --> 04:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
physician more on time when I can go in
 
04:12:44.929 --> 04:12:44.939 align:start position:0%
and do team-based care with them and
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:53.330 --> 04:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
representative so again we we know that
 
04:12:57.590 --> 04:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
this this model already exists correct
 
04:13:00.170 --> 04:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
um and and the approach that's being
 
04:13:01.729 --> 04:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
taken here is coming at this from the
 
04:13:01.739 --> 04:13:03.410 align:start position:0%
taken here is coming at this from the
insurer

04:13:03.410 --> 04:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
insurer
 
04:13:03.420 --> 04:13:04.849 align:start position:0%
insurer
um

04:13:04.849 --> 04:13:04.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:09.229 --> 04:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
uh providing for this model we heard
 
04:13:11.929 --> 04:13:11.939 align:start position:0%
that some do and some don't correct so
 
04:13:14.990 --> 04:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
would it be your testimony that if this
 
04:13:17.809 --> 04:13:17.819 align:start position:0%
bill were to be enacted into law that
 
04:13:19.849 --> 04:13:19.859 align:start position:0%
this would encourage more Primary Care
 
04:13:22.849 --> 04:13:22.859 align:start position:0%
Providers to adopt such a system and
 
04:13:24.650 --> 04:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
begin practicing it because they knew
 
04:13:26.929 --> 04:13:26.939 align:start position:0%
that there would be insurance coverage
 
04:13:29.929 --> 04:13:29.939 align:start position:0%
for them and their patients my general
 
04:13:31.550 --> 04:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
answer to that would be absolutely yes
 
04:13:34.910 --> 04:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
because what yes thank you
 
04:13:37.309 --> 04:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
okay any questions thank you very much
 
04:13:40.610 --> 04:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you okay now Alex is back in the
 
04:13:40.620 --> 04:13:43.429 align:start position:0%
thank you okay now Alex is back in the
room

04:13:43.429 --> 04:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:45.410 --> 04:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
and the insurance department here takes
 
04:13:47.330 --> 04:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
no position and but will provide
 
04:13:47.340 --> 04:13:49.250 align:start position:0%
no position and but will provide
information

04:13:49.250 --> 04:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:13:51.950 --> 04:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
and uh is is this something that also
 
04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
would CL qualify for the Murphy the
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
Murphy rule yeah that was one of the
 
04:13:59.570 --> 04:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
points of of information right
 
04:14:01.849 --> 04:14:01.859 align:start position:0%
um this uh
 
04:14:04.729 --> 04:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and you know does
 
04:14:07.490 --> 04:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
come into the category of uh mandated
 
04:14:07.500 --> 04:14:09.469 align:start position:0%
come into the category of uh mandated
coverage

04:14:09.469 --> 04:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
04:14:11.330 --> 04:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
um and it does apply to the individual
 
04:14:14.870 --> 04:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
Market as well as the group markets
 
04:14:19.729 --> 04:14:19.739 align:start position:0%
um so uh it does raise the issue of the
 
04:14:22.969 --> 04:14:22.979 align:start position:0%
defrayal concern any any mandate
 
04:14:25.429 --> 04:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
applying to the individual Market
 
04:14:30.410 --> 04:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
so that might be a reason to to refer it
 
04:14:30.420 --> 04:14:31.070 align:start position:0%
so that might be a reason to to refer it
um

04:14:31.070 --> 04:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:34.490 --> 04:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
for analysis by the department
 
04:14:34.500 --> 04:14:35.630 align:start position:0%
for analysis by the department
um

04:14:35.630 --> 04:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:39.010 --> 04:14:39.020 align:start position:0%
so that was one point but I wanted to
 
04:14:41.689 --> 04:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
start with the observation that the
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
04:14:43.680 --> 04:14:44.330 align:start position:0%
insurance department
um

04:14:44.330 --> 04:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:47.809 --> 04:14:47.819 align:start position:0%
has been interested in this model of
 
04:14:52.309 --> 04:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
care because we have been working on
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
Mental Health parity we've done we just
 
04:14:57.769 --> 04:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
concluded two major mental health parity
 
04:15:01.070 --> 04:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
exams with two the most prominent
 
04:15:03.170 --> 04:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
carriers in the state and one of the
 
04:15:05.450 --> 04:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
issues that we worked on with these
 
04:15:08.990 --> 04:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
cares was ways to expand and improve
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
their mental health networks and one of
 
04:15:12.950 --> 04:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
the items we encourage carriers to
 
04:15:15.110 --> 04:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
consider was alternative delivery models
 
04:15:17.630 --> 04:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
such as the primary care behavioral
 
04:15:19.389 --> 04:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
health model
 
04:15:21.830 --> 04:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
and my impression is the carriers are
 
04:15:25.729 --> 04:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
looking at it and some of them are
 
04:15:30.229 --> 04:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
already are already reimbursing for some
 
04:15:33.469 --> 04:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
of the services that would come out of
 
04:15:36.250 --> 04:15:36.260 align:start position:0%
this model but we do have a number of
 
04:15:38.630 --> 04:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
interpretive concerns about the bill as
 
04:15:42.170 --> 04:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
it is drafted so I wanted to mention
 
04:15:45.410 --> 04:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
those because we we would be responsible
 
04:15:49.870 --> 04:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
for enforcing it so on page two
 
04:15:52.910 --> 04:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
lines 12 through 15
 
04:15:55.809 --> 04:15:55.819 align:start position:0%
it mentions that appropriate
 
04:15:58.969 --> 04:15:58.979 align:start position:0%
billing codes called CPT codes will be
 
04:16:02.809 --> 04:16:02.819 align:start position:0%
added to psychologist contracts
 
04:16:02.819 --> 04:16:06.010 align:start position:0%
added to psychologist contracts
um

04:16:06.010 --> 04:16:06.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:09.830 --> 04:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
we you know reached out to the New
 
04:16:11.389 --> 04:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Psychological Association to
 
04:16:13.070 --> 04:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
find out what those codes might be to
 
04:16:15.170 --> 04:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
see if we could look at our own claims
 
04:16:17.030 --> 04:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
database and find out whether they're
 
04:16:19.490 --> 04:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
being reversed today or not
 
04:16:22.330 --> 04:16:22.340 align:start position:0%
um and we didn't get a specific answer
 
04:16:25.849 --> 04:16:25.859 align:start position:0%
we got an answer today don't want to be
 
04:16:25.859 --> 04:16:27.010 align:start position:0%
we got an answer today don't want to be
specific

04:16:27.010 --> 04:16:27.020 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:16:31.130 --> 04:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
about what codes would be included to
 
04:16:34.610 --> 04:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
date but in looking at the literature we
 
04:16:36.170 --> 04:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
understand that it might be for such
 
04:16:36.180 --> 04:16:37.269 align:start position:0%
understand that it might be for such
services

04:16:37.269 --> 04:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:16:41.450 --> 04:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
our codes as collaborative Care Medical
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
consultation and medical team
 
04:16:46.670 --> 04:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
conferences things like that where you
 
04:16:50.269 --> 04:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
have your number of providers putting
 
04:16:51.769 --> 04:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
their heads together on a Best Care
 
04:16:55.309 --> 04:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
model for a patient
 
04:16:57.110 --> 04:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:17:00.050 --> 04:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
um another interpretive
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
a problem that we have is same page
 
04:17:06.469 --> 04:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
lines 27 through 30. it says benefits
 
04:17:08.750 --> 04:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
arising from consultation coordination
 
04:17:10.550 --> 04:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
of care diagnosis and development of
 
04:17:12.349 --> 04:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
outcome measures for outpatient services
 
04:17:14.210 --> 04:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
under this paragraph
 
04:17:16.670 --> 04:17:16.680 align:start position:0%

04:17:21.170 --> 04:17:21.180 align:start position:0%
as favorable as those which apply to the

benefits for the treatment provided by
psychiatrists

04:17:27.110 --> 04:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:30.170 --> 04:17:30.180 align:start position:0%
um and this amends a statute which is
 
04:17:33.290 --> 04:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
um kind of old statute now it's about 47
 
04:17:35.269 --> 04:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
years old it's the state's mental health
 
04:17:37.330 --> 04:17:37.340 align:start position:0%
parity law
 
04:17:40.130 --> 04:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:17:43.490 --> 04:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
I cannot I don't know what subject to
 
04:17:46.729 --> 04:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions uh at least is
 
04:17:49.130 --> 04:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
equal to psychiatrist means in this
 
04:17:52.510 --> 04:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
context the parity law
 
04:17:55.910 --> 04:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
speaks of uh in other places the
 
04:17:58.150 --> 04:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
existing parity law speaks of
 
04:18:00.650 --> 04:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services generally no
 
04:18:02.150 --> 04:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
matter what the mental health provider
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
being subject to terms and conditions
 
04:18:08.410 --> 04:18:08.420 align:start position:0%
that are equal to Medical surgical
 
04:18:10.849 --> 04:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
benefits that's the basic idea of parity
 
04:18:13.250 --> 04:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
is mental health no matter what the
 
04:18:13.260 --> 04:18:14.349 align:start position:0%
is mental health no matter what the
provider

04:18:14.349 --> 04:18:14.359 align:start position:0%
provider
 
04:18:17.929 --> 04:18:17.939 align:start position:0%
is treated the same way as medical
 
04:18:22.570 --> 04:18:22.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:25.309 --> 04:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
psychologists being treated
 
04:18:28.729 --> 04:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
same psychiatrist we don't know how to
 
04:18:31.790 --> 04:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
interpret that it wouldn't be the same
 
04:18:34.250 --> 04:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
co-pays and deductibles
 
04:18:36.050 --> 04:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
that's probably the best way of
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
interpreting it but it um
 
04:18:41.150 --> 04:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
is written as almost as if it might mean
 
04:18:44.150 --> 04:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursed at the same rate
 
04:18:48.229 --> 04:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
um so we're not sure
 
04:18:48.239 --> 04:18:49.610 align:start position:0%
um so we're not sure
um

04:18:49.610 --> 04:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:53.389 --> 04:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
uh so that
 
04:18:56.090 --> 04:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
um I mean the part of the reason we're
 
04:18:58.729 --> 04:18:58.739 align:start position:0%
not sure is this statute that this
 
04:19:02.150 --> 04:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is being placed in is
 
04:19:05.210 --> 04:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
um old and it uses archaic terms like
 
04:19:07.790 --> 04:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
usual usual and customary rates and
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
things like that and favorable yes
 
04:19:13.849 --> 04:19:13.859 align:start position:0%
I don't think I've seen that in a long
 
04:19:15.110 --> 04:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
time yeah
 
04:19:15.120 --> 04:19:16.130 align:start position:0%
time yeah
um

04:19:16.130 --> 04:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:20.150 --> 04:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
another uh concern we have in terms of
 
04:19:22.010 --> 04:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
interpretation I just said the whole
 
04:19:24.530 --> 04:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
bill seems to be limited to
 
04:19:27.070 --> 04:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
clinical psychologists
 
04:19:29.450 --> 04:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
who are embedded in a primary care
 
04:19:32.809 --> 04:19:32.819 align:start position:0%
setting and our understanding of primary
 
04:19:34.849 --> 04:19:34.859 align:start position:0%
care Behavioral Health you know it would
 
04:19:37.610 --> 04:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
apply equally to Mental Health
 
04:19:40.070 --> 04:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
Counselors licensed clinicals social
 
04:19:40.080 --> 04:19:41.349 align:start position:0%
Counselors licensed clinicals social
workers

04:19:41.349 --> 04:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
workers
 
04:19:44.929 --> 04:19:44.939 align:start position:0%
psychiatric nurses I mean there are a
 
04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
number of other categories of providers
 
04:19:50.090 --> 04:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
and we don't understand why it's limited
 
04:19:52.969 --> 04:19:52.979 align:start position:0%
to clinical psychologists
 
04:19:56.269 --> 04:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
04:20:02.510 --> 04:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:02.520 --> 04:20:04.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:20:04.189 --> 04:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:20:06.410 --> 04:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:20:07.969 --> 04:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
for the insurance department yes
 
04:20:09.769 --> 04:20:09.779 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
04:20:11.450 --> 04:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:20:13.969 --> 04:20:13.979 align:start position:0%
um uh and again two questions but
 
04:20:15.950 --> 04:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully quick ones
 
04:20:15.960 --> 04:20:17.090 align:start position:0%
hopefully quick ones
um

04:20:17.090 --> 04:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
and this was a question I actually had
 
04:20:20.570 --> 04:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
myself before you mentioned it but I'm
 
04:20:22.429 --> 04:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
glad that you did
 
04:20:24.410 --> 04:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
um would it make sense instead of
 
04:20:24.420 --> 04:20:26.030 align:start position:0%
um would it make sense instead of
limiting

04:20:26.030 --> 04:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
limiting
 
04:20:30.050 --> 04:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
um uh Roman numeral two on on second on
 
04:20:32.889 --> 04:20:32.899 align:start position:0%
the second page uh to specifically to
 
04:20:35.950 --> 04:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
expert consultation by a psychologists
 
04:20:39.050 --> 04:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
to include other appropriate
 
04:20:42.650 --> 04:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
practitioners uh such as psychiatric
 
04:20:44.510 --> 04:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
nurses and there are a couple of other
 
04:20:47.150 --> 04:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
categories in there and then I do have a
 
04:20:49.550 --> 04:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up question right the
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
um our existing mental health parity law
 
04:20:54.769 --> 04:20:54.779 align:start position:0%
has this list of nine mental health
 
04:20:57.469 --> 04:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
provider types so you know that list
 
04:20:59.090 --> 04:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
could be used here
 
04:21:01.610 --> 04:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
thank you and then the second question
 
04:21:04.490 --> 04:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
involves the rates of payment
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not an expert here in the
 
04:21:09.290 --> 04:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
appropriate language uh but you said
 
04:21:11.929 --> 04:21:11.939 align:start position:0%
that the usual customary uh language is
 
04:21:14.269 --> 04:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
now outdated the language of usual and
 
04:21:16.370 --> 04:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
customary which is what I was thinking
 
04:21:19.370 --> 04:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh is is outdated is there a language
 
04:21:22.070 --> 04:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
that you would recommend so that
 
04:21:25.250 --> 04:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
specific types of practitioners are paid
 
04:21:27.650 --> 04:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
at the appropriate rates since some
 
04:21:31.130 --> 04:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
types of practitioners may have may
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
normally be paid at different rates than
 
04:21:37.309 --> 04:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists perhaps are paid
 
04:21:41.110 --> 04:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
um that's a complicated and highly
 
04:21:44.689 --> 04:21:44.699 align:start position:0%
contested issue under the federal mental
 
04:21:46.670 --> 04:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
health parity law
 
04:21:51.410 --> 04:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
um in the federal parity law which the
 
04:21:53.809 --> 04:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
insurance department has been working on
 
04:21:53.819 --> 04:21:55.490 align:start position:0%
insurance department has been working on
enforcing

04:21:55.490 --> 04:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
enforcing
 
04:21:55.500 --> 04:21:56.269 align:start position:0%
enforcing
um

04:21:56.269 --> 04:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:59.870 --> 04:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
with respect to payment amounts the
 
04:22:02.150 --> 04:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate is considered a quote
 
04:22:04.570 --> 04:22:04.580 align:start position:0%
non-quantitative treatment limitation
 
04:22:08.809 --> 04:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
and what that means is that
 
04:22:08.819 --> 04:22:09.910 align:start position:0%
and what that means is that
um

04:22:09.910 --> 04:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:13.070 --> 04:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to reimbursement levels
 
04:22:15.710 --> 04:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
can be in parity without being
 
04:22:15.720 --> 04:22:18.110 align:start position:0%
can be in parity without being
equivalent

04:22:18.110 --> 04:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
equivalent
 
04:22:20.590 --> 04:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
um across provider types
 
04:22:23.330 --> 04:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
so what the insurance department did in
 
04:22:25.130 --> 04:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
measuring parity is to compare
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
everything to the payment scale that's
 
04:22:29.830 --> 04:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
developed by Medicare
 
04:22:34.150 --> 04:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
and they have a very well worked out
 
04:22:37.809 --> 04:22:37.819 align:start position:0%
payment scale that's based on
 
04:22:40.990 --> 04:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
resources training
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
overhead costs all the factors that go
 
04:22:49.490 --> 04:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
into providing care and we compare in
 
04:22:51.710 --> 04:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
order to measure parity we in
 
04:22:54.170 --> 04:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
reimbursement We compare
 
04:22:57.170 --> 04:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
um rates the relativity to Medicare and
 
04:22:59.090 --> 04:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
see it and to see whether they're equal
 
04:23:02.090 --> 04:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
on both sides mental health and medical
 
04:23:02.100 --> 04:23:03.410 align:start position:0%
on both sides mental health and medical
Surgical

04:23:03.410 --> 04:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
Surgical
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
further question
 
04:23:07.729 --> 04:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
okay it's number three now
 
04:23:09.889 --> 04:23:09.899 align:start position:0%
last one
 
04:23:11.510 --> 04:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
04:23:13.309 --> 04:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
um so is there language that you could
 
04:23:16.070 --> 04:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
provide the committee uh that we could
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
use to reference the appropriate payment
 
04:23:18.720 --> 04:23:20.510 align:start position:0%
use to reference the appropriate payment
scale

04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
scale
 
04:23:20.520 --> 04:23:26.450 align:start position:0%
scale
oh

04:23:26.450 --> 04:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:26.460 --> 04:23:28.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:23:28.429 --> 04:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:31.250 --> 04:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
If This Were re-referred or something
 
04:23:33.229 --> 04:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
and over time
 
04:23:33.239 --> 04:23:34.610 align:start position:0%
and over time
um

04:23:34.610 --> 04:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:38.210 --> 04:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
uh and it were made clear that that is
 
04:23:40.250 --> 04:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
actually something that was uh intended
 
04:23:43.010 --> 04:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
to be addressed by the sponsors I'm not
 
04:23:45.530 --> 04:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
sure that it is something that was being
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
addressed by the sponsors the um payment
 
04:23:48.720 --> 04:23:49.849 align:start position:0%
addressed by the sponsors the um payment
level

04:23:49.849 --> 04:23:49.859 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:23:53.689 --> 04:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
I think the main goal here was to
 
04:23:53.699 --> 04:23:54.290 align:start position:0%
I think the main goal here was to
um

04:23:54.290 --> 04:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:54.300 --> 04:23:56.470 align:start position:0%
um
create

04:23:56.470 --> 04:23:56.480 align:start position:0%

and not to worry that much about
 
04:24:08.750 --> 04:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
dictating the payment amount I only
 
04:24:11.450 --> 04:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
asked because you asked yeah I'm sorry I
 
04:24:11.460 --> 04:24:12.170 align:start position:0%
asked because you asked yeah I'm sorry I
did

04:24:12.170 --> 04:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
did
 
04:24:12.180 --> 04:24:15.950 align:start position:0%
did
[Laughter]

04:24:15.950 --> 04:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
well when we send this off to you to do
 
04:24:18.960 --> 04:24:19.990 align:start position:0%
well when we send this off to you to do
your

04:24:19.990 --> 04:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:24:23.330 --> 04:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
analysis you'll have to figure out those
 
04:24:26.330 --> 04:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
parameters yeah
 
04:24:26.340 --> 04:24:28.429 align:start position:0%
parameters yeah
okay

04:24:28.429 --> 04:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:24:30.889 --> 04:24:30.899 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah representative
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
just wanted a little bit more clarity on
 
04:24:35.870 --> 04:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
the new model and this really is about
 
04:24:38.090 --> 04:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
insurance and claims and reimbursement
 
04:24:40.550 --> 04:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
and what the patient actually has to pay
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
so is this
 
04:24:45.950 --> 04:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
um going to bundle these Services
 
04:24:49.010 --> 04:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
together so that
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
um in the tradition I'm trying to figure
 
04:24:52.309 --> 04:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
out the difference between a traditional
 
04:24:55.309 --> 04:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
model in this model so in a traditional
 
04:24:58.490 --> 04:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
model to get referred and each provider
 
04:25:00.650 --> 04:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
would have a schedule and their own
 
04:25:03.290 --> 04:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
co-payment requirements I see something
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
in here about co-payments but then under
 
04:25:08.290 --> 04:25:08.300 align:start position:0%
this model
 
04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
the services are bundled together so
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
that the claims all come in together and
 
04:25:17.870 --> 04:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
they're adjudicated together and the
 
04:25:21.410 --> 04:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
co-payment may be different is that I
 
04:25:24.290 --> 04:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
think that's pretty much right yeah I
 
04:25:26.210 --> 04:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
think that's pretty much right what you
 
04:25:29.150 --> 04:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
know the goal here is to
 
04:25:29.160 --> 04:25:30.110 align:start position:0%
know the goal here is to
um

04:25:30.110 --> 04:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:32.510 --> 04:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
sort of facilitate access to mental
 
04:25:34.370 --> 04:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
health people go to the primary care
 
04:25:37.490 --> 04:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
providers easily they don't go to Mental
 
04:25:41.149 --> 04:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
Health Providers as easily you go to
 
04:25:43.010 --> 04:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
your primary care provider and you
 
04:25:45.649 --> 04:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you have anxiety or or
 
04:25:49.070 --> 04:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
whatnot and under this model it's easy
 
04:25:49.080 --> 04:25:50.210 align:start position:0%
whatnot and under this model it's easy
to

04:25:50.210 --> 04:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:25:54.290 --> 04:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
slide that person over to someone who's
 
04:25:57.590 --> 04:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
in the office and then it's also
 
04:26:00.309 --> 04:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
facilitates this collaborative
 
04:26:03.649 --> 04:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
consultation for coming up with the care
 
04:26:06.290 --> 04:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
plan for that patient so
 
04:26:06.300 --> 04:26:06.950 align:start position:0%
plan for that patient so
um

04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:10.610 --> 04:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
that collaborative consultation piece
 
04:26:13.729 --> 04:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
would involve a kind of bundling of
 
04:26:13.739 --> 04:26:15.290 align:start position:0%
would involve a kind of bundling of
services

04:26:15.290 --> 04:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:26:15.300 --> 04:26:17.210 align:start position:0%
services
yes

04:26:17.210 --> 04:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:26:20.450 --> 04:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:22.969 --> 04:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you Alex
 
04:26:22.979 --> 04:26:29.689 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you Alex
uh

04:26:29.689 --> 04:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:34.849 --> 04:26:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:38.269 --> 04:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:38.279 --> 04:26:45.670 align:start position:0%

in support of sb235 hopefully some of my
 
04:27:01.969 --> 04:27:01.979 align:start position:0%
testimony will also answer some of the
 
04:27:04.670 --> 04:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
questions that have come up am I yelling
 
04:27:06.830 --> 04:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
at you I can't help
 
04:27:09.410 --> 04:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
um I also want to thank Senator chandley

Julie Walter I'm the director of
 
04:27:16.130 --> 04:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
professional Affairs and the chair of
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
the Behavioral Health Care advocacy
 
04:27:20.570 --> 04:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
Committee of New Hampshire Psychological
 
04:27:20.580 --> 04:27:22.130 align:start position:0%
Committee of New Hampshire Psychological
Association

04:27:22.130 --> 04:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
Association
 
04:27:24.410 --> 04:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
as you know there are a variety of ways
 
04:27:26.510 --> 04:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
that mental health and substance use
 
04:27:28.630 --> 04:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
treatment are accessed
 
04:27:30.610 --> 04:27:30.620 align:start position:0%
as we've heard
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
many patients initially present with
 
04:27:34.969 --> 04:27:34.979 align:start position:0%
mental health and substance use symptoms
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
at their Primary Care visit what this
 
04:27:40.910 --> 04:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill addresses that we hope addresses is
 
04:27:43.510 --> 04:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
the primary care Behavioral Health
 
04:27:46.189 --> 04:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
which supports and enhances the medical
 
04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
team through offering consultations and
 
04:27:51.110 --> 04:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
short-term treatment as Dr Schuman
 
04:27:53.570 --> 04:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned to patients under the team's
 
04:27:53.580 --> 04:27:54.410 align:start position:0%
mentioned to patients under the team's
care

04:27:54.410 --> 04:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
care
 
04:27:57.889 --> 04:27:57.899 align:start position:0%
it is one stop shopping and within this
 
04:28:01.130 --> 04:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
model care can happen on the same day by
 
04:28:03.610 --> 04:28:03.620 align:start position:0%
a psychologist or other mental health
 
04:28:05.870 --> 04:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
licensed mental health professionals so
 
04:28:07.849 --> 04:28:07.859 align:start position:0%
it's not just psychologists it's also
 
04:28:11.290 --> 04:28:11.300 align:start position:0%
other licensed professionals
 
04:28:14.689 --> 04:28:14.699 align:start position:0%
research has showed I'm a psychologist I
 
04:28:17.570 --> 04:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
live with Statistics so I bear with me a
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
14 decrease in emergency room visits
 
04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
it's also showed a 7.5 percent increase
 
04:28:28.330 --> 04:28:28.340 align:start position:0%
in Behavioral Health visits a 12
 
04:28:31.729 --> 04:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
decrease in Primary Care visits what
 
04:28:34.630 --> 04:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
this research says to us is that
 
04:28:37.790 --> 04:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
patients are accessing the appropriate
 
04:28:40.130 --> 04:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
care rather than going to emergency
 
04:28:42.349 --> 04:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
rooms when they don't necessarily need
 
04:28:44.269 --> 04:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
to go there
 
04:28:46.250 --> 04:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
um we also believe that this bill
 
04:28:50.750 --> 04:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
addresses Workforce issues and that in
 
04:28:53.689 --> 04:28:53.699 align:start position:0%
nhpa does a annual mental health
 
04:28:57.189 --> 04:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
practice survey our most recent survey
 
04:29:00.769 --> 04:29:00.779 align:start position:0%
the results indicate what we all know 79
 
04:29:03.290 --> 04:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
percent of clinicians report often to
 
04:29:06.050 --> 04:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
almost always having difficulty finding
 
04:29:09.050 --> 04:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
other clinicians accepting new patients
 
04:29:13.030 --> 04:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is to codify the critical into
 
04:29:16.189 --> 04:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
integrated care practice to help
 
04:29:19.010 --> 04:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
increase the workforce where mental
 
04:29:21.290 --> 04:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
health and substance use concerns often
 
04:29:23.870 --> 04:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
present first in the Primary Care
 
04:29:27.769 --> 04:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:31.610 --> 04:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
about the CPT codes we purposely have
 
04:29:34.849 --> 04:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
not included CPT codes because this bill
 
04:29:37.370 --> 04:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
is about codifying just like Telehealth
 
04:29:40.070 --> 04:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
as a codified service
 
04:29:40.080 --> 04:29:40.790 align:start position:0%
as a codified service
um

04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
CBT codes are Dynamic and we wanted a
 
04:29:46.510 --> 04:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
bill that captures the services provided
 
04:29:50.330 --> 04:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
we did provide CPT codes to Anthem and
 
04:29:53.530 --> 04:29:53.540 align:start position:0%
point 32 Health as a reference point
 
04:29:56.689 --> 04:29:56.699 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the many conversations and
 
04:29:58.309 --> 04:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
thought-provoking questions and
 
04:30:01.610 --> 04:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
information provided by both Anthem and
 
04:30:04.309 --> 04:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
point 32 health over the past year
 
04:30:06.830 --> 04:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
we are not requesting to mandate
 
04:30:09.469 --> 04:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
coverage we are asking that of
 
04:30:12.050 --> 04:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
integrated care services are a covered
 
04:30:15.710 --> 04:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
benefit that pcbh services including
 
04:30:17.630 --> 04:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
both consultation and the treatment
 
04:30:20.689 --> 04:30:20.699 align:start position:0%
services within that model are covered
 
04:30:23.330 --> 04:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
and reimbursed fairly within current
 
04:30:26.149 --> 04:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
laws and CPT codes
 
04:30:28.910 --> 04:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
so again this bill is about increasing
 
04:30:31.670 --> 04:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce opportunity at the physician's
 
04:30:34.010 --> 04:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
office to reduce the unnecessary
 
04:30:36.889 --> 04:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
emergency room visits and reduce delays
 
04:30:38.870 --> 04:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
in starting treatment that can happen
 
04:30:41.210 --> 04:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
with referrals
 
04:30:43.070 --> 04:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much for your time I
 
04:30:44.510 --> 04:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I'm happy to answer
 
04:30:49.250 --> 04:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative spear
 
04:30:52.189 --> 04:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just a question
 
04:30:54.590 --> 04:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
so the primary care physician would be
 
04:30:56.750 --> 04:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
the first touch point for this kind of
 
04:30:58.670 --> 04:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
care does the primary care physician
 
04:31:01.969 --> 04:31:01.979 align:start position:0%
himself have the training which with I
 
04:31:03.950 --> 04:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
think we talked about that on a previous
 
04:31:03.960 --> 04:31:05.269 align:start position:0%
think we talked about that on a previous
uh

04:31:05.269 --> 04:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:31:08.809 --> 04:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
uh uh represent a person that spoke to
 
04:31:10.189 --> 04:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
us sure
 
04:31:13.070 --> 04:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
did they provide the first level of care
 
04:31:15.110 --> 04:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
for the mental situation that we're
 
04:31:17.030 --> 04:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
talking about and it may not ever ever
 
04:31:19.729 --> 04:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
would go any further than that it might
 
04:31:21.769 --> 04:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
not but if you have a psychologist or
 
04:31:23.210 --> 04:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
other licensed mental health
 
04:31:25.250 --> 04:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
professional depending on what the
 
04:31:28.309 --> 04:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
primary care assessment is there can be
 
04:31:31.550 --> 04:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
a warm handoff right at that same day to
 
04:31:33.830 --> 04:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
the to the mental health professional on
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
staff so a follow-up if I may so does
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
that mean that we don't have the codes
 
04:31:42.050 --> 04:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh the insurance codes
 
04:31:45.110 --> 04:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
for such a handoff of even the um
 
04:31:47.630 --> 04:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
primary care physician to perform that
 
04:31:49.309 --> 04:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
kind of an activity
 
04:31:52.189 --> 04:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
where some of the
 
04:31:54.950 --> 04:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
the difficulties we're finding regarding
 
04:31:58.729 --> 04:31:58.739 align:start position:0%
the codes is the consultation piece is
 
04:32:01.250 --> 04:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
not all of the consultation piece is
 
04:32:01.260 --> 04:32:02.450 align:start position:0%
not all of the consultation piece is
covered

04:32:02.450 --> 04:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
covered
 
04:32:05.450 --> 04:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
across the board like by all insurance
 
04:32:05.460 --> 04:32:13.910 align:start position:0%
across the board like by all insurance
companies

04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:17.330 --> 04:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:20.330 --> 04:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
in your experience have you seen that
 
04:32:22.910 --> 04:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
there are providers that are putting in
 
04:32:26.210 --> 04:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
fees for service using the code
 
04:32:27.889 --> 04:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
have called their behavioral health
 
04:32:30.830 --> 04:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
provider to come in during a crisis who
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
then have to use the exact same code and
 
04:32:35.269 --> 04:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
that code is rejected have you seen that
 
04:32:39.110 --> 04:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
happen there is some of that there is
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
some of where
 
04:32:44.689 --> 04:32:44.699 align:start position:0%
it's just not being billed because in
 
04:32:46.849 --> 04:32:46.859 align:start position:0%
the past it's been denied and so the
 
04:32:49.729 --> 04:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
practice has now become it's some where
 
04:32:52.729 --> 04:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
they don't want an extra copay and so
 
04:32:54.110 --> 04:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
they won't bill it because they don't
 
04:32:57.290 --> 04:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
want the extra copay thank you in this
 
04:32:59.330 --> 04:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
phrase in here when care is provided
 
04:33:02.510 --> 04:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
through a pcbm Model A Health Plan shall
 
04:33:06.070 --> 04:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
not impose more than one copay per day
 
04:33:08.689 --> 04:33:08.699 align:start position:0%
for individuals obtaining multiple
 
04:33:10.609 --> 04:33:10.619 align:start position:0%
related services
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
yes that's what we're so it would still
 
04:33:16.689 --> 04:33:16.699 align:start position:0%
be true under this bill
 
04:33:16.699 --> 04:33:18.529 align:start position:0%
be true under this bill
okay

04:33:18.529 --> 04:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:33:21.949 --> 04:33:21.959 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
04:33:23.449 --> 04:33:23.459 align:start position:0%
thank you you have written testimony I
 
04:33:23.459 --> 04:33:24.650 align:start position:0%
thank you you have written testimony I
do

04:33:24.650 --> 04:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:33:27.051 --> 04:33:27.061 align:start position:0%
that'd be awesome thank you okay I have
 
04:33:39.830 --> 04:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
hello chairman hunt and members of the
 
04:33:43.250 --> 04:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Sabrina Dunlap director of
 
04:33:46.131 --> 04:33:46.141 align:start position:0%
government relations for anthem
 
04:33:49.250 --> 04:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
so we have spent a lot of time talking
 
04:33:51.769 --> 04:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
and working on this bill
 
04:33:54.830 --> 04:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the folks who
 
04:33:56.810 --> 04:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
support the bill agree that the best
 
04:33:58.609 --> 04:33:58.619 align:start position:0%
path forward is to retain the bill so we
 
04:34:01.131 --> 04:34:01.141 align:start position:0%
can continue to work on it
 
04:34:03.429 --> 04:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
um I will just list off some of our
 
04:34:05.929 --> 04:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill as drafted I did
 
04:34:08.510 --> 04:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
sign in as neutral we are opposed to the
 
04:34:10.730 --> 04:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
bill as drafted but we support
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
the general idea
 
04:34:13.439 --> 04:34:14.269 align:start position:0%
the general idea
um

04:34:14.269 --> 04:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:17.090 --> 04:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
so and and the folks behind me are aware
 
04:34:19.131 --> 04:34:19.141 align:start position:0%
of of most of these concerns we have
 
04:34:21.230 --> 04:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
with the actual language
 
04:34:24.529 --> 04:34:24.539 align:start position:0%
um but there's some issues around sort
 
04:34:25.970 --> 04:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
of vague terms
 
04:34:28.670 --> 04:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
things that are not clearly defined
 
04:34:32.570 --> 04:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
I would flag one in Roman two it says
 
04:34:34.670 --> 04:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
consultation with a physician I know
 
04:34:36.109 --> 04:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to our clinical mental
 
04:34:38.330 --> 04:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
health folks and they said is a consult
 
04:34:40.131 --> 04:34:40.141 align:start position:0%
where the provider sees the patient is a
 
04:34:41.810 --> 04:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
consult a phone call what exactly does
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
that mean
 
04:34:43.439 --> 04:34:44.209 align:start position:0%
that mean
um

04:34:44.209 --> 04:34:44.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:47.869 --> 04:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
there's some questions around
 
04:34:50.810 --> 04:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
um Alex feldable mentioned section e
 
04:34:53.090 --> 04:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
around terms and conditions at least as
 
04:34:55.010 --> 04:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
favorable between psychologists and
 
04:34:56.869 --> 04:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists were not entirely sure
 
04:34:58.390 --> 04:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
what that means
 
04:35:00.590 --> 04:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
and a couple of other sort of smaller
 
04:35:04.429 --> 04:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
issues the effective date and
 
04:35:07.070 --> 04:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
um the new language added in the Senate
 
04:35:09.410 --> 04:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
Amendment around the ACT mandating
 
04:35:12.650 --> 04:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage of the model we do
 
04:35:15.769 --> 04:35:15.779 align:start position:0%
read that as a clear mandate so
 
04:35:18.410 --> 04:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
I would just also flag that in my
 
04:35:21.051 --> 04:35:21.061 align:start position:0%
conversations with our clinical folks my
 
04:35:22.910 --> 04:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is the model is evolving
 
04:35:24.051 --> 04:35:24.061 align:start position:0%
and I think someone mentioned that
 
04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
earlier and so there is not a lot of
 
04:35:28.849 --> 04:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
clarity around what the codes are
 
04:35:31.609 --> 04:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
um I my understanding is insurance is
 
04:35:33.949 --> 04:35:33.959 align:start position:0%
not actually the barrier here and I
 
04:35:35.810 --> 04:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
think this is very similar to a
 
04:35:37.131 --> 04:35:37.141 align:start position:0%
situation we had a few years ago with
 
04:35:39.470 --> 04:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
the collaborative care model there was a
 
04:35:40.609 --> 04:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
bill to mandate coverage of
 
04:35:43.131 --> 04:35:43.141 align:start position:0%
collaborative care which is very similar
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
to this model it's not the same I
 
04:35:47.631 --> 04:35:47.641 align:start position:0%
honestly don't know what the distinction
 
04:35:47.641 --> 04:35:48.709 align:start position:0%
honestly don't know what the distinction
is

04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:35:50.209 --> 04:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
um but collaborative care model also
 
04:35:51.529 --> 04:35:51.539 align:start position:0%
involves a mental health care provider
 
04:35:53.570 --> 04:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
being sort of integrated in the primary
 
04:35:55.730 --> 04:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
care setting and that does exist and
 
04:35:57.289 --> 04:35:57.299 align:start position:0%
that is covered and I will say when that
 
04:35:58.910 --> 04:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
bill came up
 
04:36:00.830 --> 04:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
um we came up with a non-legislative
 
04:36:03.349 --> 04:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
solution involving uh the New Hampshire
 
04:36:04.970 --> 04:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
Psychological Association other
 
04:36:07.010 --> 04:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
stakeholders providers all of the big
 
04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
carriers we actually sat together with
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
the insurance department around a table
 
04:36:14.570 --> 04:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
for I think 18 months and instead of
 
04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
moving forward with a bill that we
 
04:36:17.269 --> 04:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
didn't think actually solved a problem
 
04:36:19.849 --> 04:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
we got together we talked about it and
 
04:36:22.609 --> 04:36:22.619 align:start position:0%
we actually like opened up the coding
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
issues there were challenges around
 
04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
understanding what codes are covered
 
04:36:27.470 --> 04:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
where what codes are appropriate and
 
04:36:29.810 --> 04:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
what situation and we actually made real
 
04:36:32.209 --> 04:36:32.219 align:start position:0%
progress and collaborative care has been
 
04:36:34.131 --> 04:36:34.141 align:start position:0%
adopted my understanding is it's been
 
04:36:34.141 --> 04:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
adopted my understanding is it's been
adopted

04:36:35.510 --> 04:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
04:36:37.789 --> 04:36:37.799 align:start position:0%
um more than it had been you know before
 
04:36:40.670 --> 04:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
we sat down together so I think just
 
04:36:42.529 --> 04:36:42.539 align:start position:0%
sort of bigger picture
 
04:36:44.269 --> 04:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
um we're not opposed to these sorts of
 
04:36:46.010 --> 04:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
models we want people to have more
 
04:36:47.750 --> 04:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
access to mental health care we
 
04:36:49.310 --> 04:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
understand all the challenges that exist
 
04:36:51.051 --> 04:36:51.061 align:start position:0%
in the state I think there's some
 
04:36:53.029 --> 04:36:53.039 align:start position:0%
questions around what exactly this model
 
04:36:56.029 --> 04:36:56.039 align:start position:0%
is and then I also know that the codes
 
04:36:58.429 --> 04:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
are emerging like I just heard that CMS
 
04:37:01.070 --> 04:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
just approved a new code in this space I
 
04:37:03.769 --> 04:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
mean it's very new and so I know that we
 
04:37:06.230 --> 04:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
do Anthem does cover several of the
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
codes that the psych Association has
 
04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
flagged for us and it's just not clear
 
04:37:13.070 --> 04:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
to me why exactly they're not being
 
04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
adopted more
 
04:37:14.760 --> 04:37:15.410 align:start position:0%
adopted more
um

04:37:15.410 --> 04:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:17.150 --> 04:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
so I did just want to give that example
 
04:37:19.789 --> 04:37:19.799 align:start position:0%
of you know a situation where we didn't
 
04:37:21.170 --> 04:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
have we didn't need legislation we
 
04:37:22.310 --> 04:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
actually just needed to sit down and
 
04:37:23.750 --> 04:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
figure out what the Practical barriers
 
04:37:23.760 --> 04:37:24.890 align:start position:0%
figure out what the Practical barriers
were

04:37:24.890 --> 04:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
um I think that could be useful here
 
04:37:27.480 --> 04:37:29.090 align:start position:0%
um I think that could be useful here
um

04:37:29.090 --> 04:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:32.029 --> 04:37:32.039 align:start position:0%
and I will just say we we have not seen
 
04:37:35.750 --> 04:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
a bill like this in any other states
 
04:37:39.949 --> 04:37:39.959 align:start position:0%
um and I do think we need more time to
 
04:37:43.310 --> 04:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
sort of work out the language and I I
 
04:37:45.470 --> 04:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
think I'm a little confused Honestly by
 
04:37:46.849 --> 04:37:46.859 align:start position:0%
the bill and the way it's drafted right
 
04:37:46.859 --> 04:37:47.929 align:start position:0%
the bill and the way it's drafted right
now

04:37:47.929 --> 04:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:37:50.209 --> 04:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
um and so I do
 
04:37:53.029 --> 04:37:53.039 align:start position:0%
you know we want to collaborate with the
 
04:37:56.090 --> 04:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
psych Association and others and we
 
04:37:57.529 --> 04:37:57.539 align:start position:0%
would like to continue working on this
 
04:38:00.349 --> 04:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
but I think you know if we had if it was
 
04:38:01.849 --> 04:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
retained and we had time to continue
 
04:38:03.470 --> 04:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
talking and working through some of
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
these issues that would be very helpful
 
04:38:08.750 --> 04:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
um so I think that was everything I'm
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:14.330 --> 04:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
representative Terry just really quickly
 
04:38:16.609 --> 04:38:16.619 align:start position:0%
here your testimony opens up a lot of
 
04:38:18.590 --> 04:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
different questions and so I can
 
04:38:20.330 --> 04:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
understand why you're suggesting that be
 
04:38:23.689 --> 04:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
retained but with respect to CPT codes
 
04:38:25.490 --> 04:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like I believe you said
 
04:38:27.650 --> 04:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
that they're evolving do you look
 
04:38:32.929 --> 04:38:32.939 align:start position:0%
primarily to CMS for CPT codes across
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
the 50 states therefore and not just
 
04:38:37.910 --> 04:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
specifically New Hampshire because one
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
of the things that I believe I was
 
04:38:41.390 --> 04:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
hearing earlier on is that there is
 
04:38:43.551 --> 04:38:43.561 align:start position:0%
there are issues and concerns around CPT
 
04:38:46.849 --> 04:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
codes and and I guess I'm wondering who
 
04:38:50.631 --> 04:38:50.641 align:start position:0%
are we looking to for the development uh
 
04:38:52.970 --> 04:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
and the the publication if you will in
 
04:38:55.429 --> 04:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
adoption of CPT codes and it sounds like
 
04:38:56.570 --> 04:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
you're telling me that's coming from
 
04:38:56.580 --> 04:38:57.769 align:start position:0%
you're telling me that's coming from
Washington

04:38:57.769 --> 04:38:57.779 align:start position:0%
Washington
 
04:39:00.590 --> 04:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
I think in general that is usually the
 
04:39:03.709 --> 04:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
process that CMS adopts a code or allows
 
04:39:05.150 --> 04:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
a certain code and then it can be
 
04:39:07.310 --> 04:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
covered under Medicare and carriers
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
often take their cues from from CMS on
 
04:39:11.279 --> 04:39:14.029 align:start position:0%
often take their cues from from CMS on
codes

04:39:14.029 --> 04:39:14.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:17.150 --> 04:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
04:39:20.570 --> 04:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
I'm shocked John you would do this to me
 
04:39:23.631 --> 04:39:23.641 align:start position:0%
if I bring it in a card after I announce
 
04:39:28.510 --> 04:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:33.670 --> 04:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:36.170 --> 04:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to clarify a
 
04:39:37.250 --> 04:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
couple of points for the record John
 
04:39:38.750 --> 04:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
DeJohn representing New Hampshire's
 
04:39:40.970 --> 04:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
Psychological Association and I want to
 
04:39:43.190 --> 04:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
respond to a couple of comments from Ms
 
04:39:46.310 --> 04:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
Dunlap as well as from Mr feldable and I
 
04:39:48.530 --> 04:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
would like to reiterate what the
 
04:39:50.270 --> 04:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
previous speakers have have said
 
04:39:52.090 --> 04:39:52.100 align:start position:0%
regarding the
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
conversations with the insurers they
 
04:39:58.430 --> 04:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
have we have been working for I don't
 
04:39:59.868 --> 04:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
even know at this point time has no
 
04:40:01.368 --> 04:40:01.378 align:start position:0%
meaning since covered but about nine
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
months probably talking about this off
 
04:40:08.090 --> 04:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
and on with the uh the insurers and
 
04:40:10.610 --> 04:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
sharing points back and forth and what I
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
can tell you is the Salient point is
 
04:40:15.288 --> 04:40:15.298 align:start position:0%
that the insurance companies Anthem in
 
04:40:17.390 --> 04:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
particular Point 32 as well have said to
 
04:40:19.310 --> 04:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
us repeatedly they don't believe this is
 
04:40:21.050 --> 04:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
an insurance issue
 
04:40:23.868 --> 04:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
and the psychologists have responded by
 
04:40:26.570 --> 04:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
saying but psychologists aren't being
 
04:40:26.580 --> 04:40:28.010 align:start position:0%
saying but psychologists aren't being
reimbursed

04:40:28.010 --> 04:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
 
04:40:30.650 --> 04:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
and neither of us can get our heads
 
04:40:34.010 --> 04:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
around what the issue is as far as why
 
04:40:36.230 --> 04:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursements aren't happening if in
 
04:40:38.990 --> 04:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
fact it should be covered
 
04:40:42.350 --> 04:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of the comments from Mr
 
04:40:45.170 --> 04:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
felvable this is a creation of OLS
 
04:40:47.690 --> 04:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
obviously this is not the exact draft
 
04:40:50.390 --> 04:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
that we submitted to OLS but when we
 
04:40:52.310 --> 04:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
read it we were comfortable enough with
 
04:40:55.190 --> 04:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
the language and so in speaking with um
 
04:40:57.770 --> 04:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
folks Insurance folks yesterday they
 
04:40:59.150 --> 04:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
raised the same two points that Mr
 
04:41:01.990 --> 04:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
feldable did and what I had said to them
 
04:41:05.570 --> 04:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
is that this is not intended to set
 
04:41:07.850 --> 04:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
rates this is not intended to have
 
04:41:09.530 --> 04:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
psychologists reimbursed at the same
 
04:41:13.030 --> 04:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
level as psychology as psychiatrists
 
04:41:16.430 --> 04:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
and benefits arise from consultation are
 
04:41:17.868 --> 04:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
not intended to change the benefit
 
04:41:21.410 --> 04:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
structure or the the plan structure
 
04:41:24.650 --> 04:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
as Mr felvapable pointed out and you had
 
04:41:26.990 --> 04:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
commented this is old language we didn't
 
04:41:28.550 --> 04:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
ask that be put in this chapter this is
 
04:41:31.190 --> 04:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
where OLS put it we are more than
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
willing to Wordsmith some of these areas
 
04:41:37.970 --> 04:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
of confusion because we see this
 
04:41:41.150 --> 04:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
primarily as a practice bill
 
04:41:43.610 --> 04:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
I do know that there's there's been
 
04:41:45.230 --> 04:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
suggestion that this doesn't really need
 
04:41:47.208 --> 04:41:47.218 align:start position:0%
to be statute we can do this in an extra
 
04:41:50.448 --> 04:41:50.458 align:start position:0%
statutory way this is very important to
 
04:41:52.850 --> 04:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
the Psychological Association to have
 
04:41:57.050 --> 04:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
the practice model as part of statute
 
04:42:00.050 --> 04:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
we excluded CPT codes and and quite
 
04:42:01.430 --> 04:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
honestly I can't plan the psychologist
 
04:42:03.470 --> 04:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
that was all me
 
04:42:06.410 --> 04:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
I recommended not putting CPT codes in
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
because that's really where the Crux of
 
04:42:10.128 --> 04:42:10.138 align:start position:0%
the conversation ought to be happening
 
04:42:12.470 --> 04:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
over time and that's not something we're
 
04:42:15.170 --> 04:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
asking you folks to
 
04:42:17.868 --> 04:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
um identify this or that CPT code we'll
 
04:42:20.690 --> 04:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
continue talking with the insurers about
 
04:42:22.610 --> 04:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for the practice
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
model to be codified
 
04:42:28.730 --> 04:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
so that this can move forward
 
04:42:31.070 --> 04:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
in ways that it does it's not moving
 
04:42:32.810 --> 04:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
forward now
 
04:42:35.390 --> 04:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
as far as retaining the bill the
 
04:42:37.010 --> 04:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
psychologists do not currently support
 
04:42:39.288 --> 04:42:39.298 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill we are asking this
 
04:42:41.868 --> 04:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
bill be passed however it is my
 
04:42:44.628 --> 04:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
understanding that the committee has
 
04:42:47.448 --> 04:42:47.458 align:start position:0%
agreed to not exec this right off and to
 
04:42:49.730 --> 04:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
give us a few weeks to keep talking we
 
04:42:51.288 --> 04:42:51.298 align:start position:0%
would very much appreciate that and
 
04:42:52.670 --> 04:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
we'll keep working diligently during
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
that period if at the end of that period
 
04:42:57.530 --> 04:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
we're still trying to get stuff together
 
04:43:01.368 --> 04:43:01.378 align:start position:0%
we might we might recommend retention at
 
04:43:03.890 --> 04:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
that point the biggest concern though
 
04:43:05.570 --> 04:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
with retaining the bills when working on
 
04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
this for nine months
 
04:43:09.770 --> 04:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
or so if we're going to work on this for
 
04:43:11.930 --> 04:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
another six to nine months there needs
 
04:43:13.310 --> 04:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
to be something that's going to be
 
04:43:15.050 --> 04:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
different I think the worst thing that
 
04:43:16.850 --> 04:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
could happen is to retain this bill and
 
04:43:19.070 --> 04:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
come back in in November and when you
 
04:43:20.570 --> 04:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
folks say to us well what are you
 
04:43:22.190 --> 04:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
recommending now what's different we
 
04:43:23.868 --> 04:43:23.878 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer for you so there
 
04:43:27.410 --> 04:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
needs to be a clear goal that we and the
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
insurance companies can agree on in
 
04:43:31.010 --> 04:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
order for us to support retaining the
 
04:43:31.970 --> 04:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
bill so we know what we're working
 
04:43:34.788 --> 04:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
towards and in that case that might be
 
04:43:36.530 --> 04:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
an appropriate um
 
04:43:39.590 --> 04:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
an appropriate outcome at this point
 
04:43:43.730 --> 04:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
and with that I will stop talking
 
04:43:46.970 --> 04:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
okay representative amen has a question
 
04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for uh
 
04:43:51.410 --> 04:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
taking our questions and testifying
 
04:43:53.030 --> 04:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that it's a practice
 
04:43:55.970 --> 04:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
bill and I guess practice can have two
 
04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
different meetings in this context
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and then you also mentioned model
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
legislation and it was referenced that
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
no other state had this bill so is the
 
04:44:05.520 --> 04:44:06.708 align:start position:0%
no other state had this bill so is the
goal

04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
goal
 
04:44:09.470 --> 04:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
to take model legislation
 
04:44:12.788 --> 04:44:12.798 align:start position:0%
put it you want to
 
04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
create the first bill of its kind
 
04:44:18.650 --> 04:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
this is what I'm hearing and maybe you
 
04:44:20.510 --> 04:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
could either let me know if it's
 
04:44:23.930 --> 04:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
accurate and then then when you have one
 
04:44:26.030 --> 04:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh State adopting it you can go to other
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
states and say do the same thing is that
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
the goal the purpose of this Bill thank
 
04:44:32.570 --> 04:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
you very much for the question no that's
 
04:44:33.948 --> 04:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
not the purpose of the bill we we've
 
04:44:35.650 --> 04:44:35.660 align:start position:0%
already missed the boat this is already
 
04:44:39.530 --> 04:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:43.010 --> 04:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
we are moving forward on this because we
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
believe it's a viable model and we
 
04:44:46.490 --> 04:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
believe you know I represent the
 
04:44:49.070 --> 04:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
psychologists that's the the answer to
 
04:44:50.868 --> 04:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
Mr falbeable's question is why does this
 
04:44:52.010 --> 04:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
mention psychologists because I
 
04:44:54.170 --> 04:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
represent the psychologists it's not
 
04:44:56.930 --> 04:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
that you know licsws could be part of
 
04:44:59.090 --> 04:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
this other professionals could be part
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
of this my recommendation to the
 
04:45:03.770 --> 04:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
psychologist was to start small
 
04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
my concern was if we came into Health
 
04:45:08.510 --> 04:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
which is where we really expected to be
 
04:45:10.550 --> 04:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
but if we come into health or Commerce
 
04:45:12.110 --> 04:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
saying we want to add this professional
 
04:45:13.670 --> 04:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
this professional this professional this
 
04:45:15.470 --> 04:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
professional it would be more
 
04:45:17.628 --> 04:45:17.638 align:start position:0%
problematic than saying we want to add
 
04:45:19.490 --> 04:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
this professional group and let's try it
 
04:45:21.110 --> 04:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
and see how it works so that was my
 
04:45:22.730 --> 04:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
recommendation to them
 
04:45:22.740 --> 04:45:23.330 align:start position:0%
recommendation to them
um

04:45:23.330 --> 04:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:25.670 --> 04:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
no this is not intended to be a beach
 
04:45:28.250 --> 04:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
head where we go across the country and
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
get this in every state this is intended
 
04:45:33.650 --> 04:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
to to introduce a model that we think
 
04:45:36.110 --> 04:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial to the citizens of
 
04:45:40.570 --> 04:45:40.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:42.770 --> 04:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
when you said the word practice bill
 
04:45:46.430 --> 04:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
yeah because you just yeah clarify what
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
that means just for my Layman's ears
 
04:45:50.868 --> 04:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
absolutely so when I say practice what I
 
04:45:53.510 --> 04:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
mean is the the clinical practice of
 
04:45:56.570 --> 04:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
psychology so we see this as a bill that
 
04:45:57.948 --> 04:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
enhances the clinical practice of
 
04:46:00.288 --> 04:46:00.298 align:start position:0%
psychology vis-a-vis Primary Care
 
04:46:00.298 --> 04:46:01.550 align:start position:0%
psychology vis-a-vis Primary Care
Medicine

04:46:01.550 --> 04:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
Medicine
 
04:46:03.410 --> 04:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
that's how we see this so that's when I
 
04:46:08.030 --> 04:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:08.040 --> 04:46:09.788 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:46:09.788 --> 04:46:09.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:12.830 --> 04:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
this is an insurance committee and this
 
04:46:15.410 --> 04:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
bill is in the insurance section
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
so we don't generally do practice
 
04:46:21.948 --> 04:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
in the insurance section we usually take
 
04:46:25.010 --> 04:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
a practice that occurs and then mandates
 
04:46:27.590 --> 04:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
third-party coverage
 
04:46:29.570 --> 04:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
which is why we were surprised that it
 
04:46:32.930 --> 04:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
was vacated from Health but that the way
 
04:46:35.150 --> 04:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
the bill is written this is an insurance
 
04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
bill because it's in the insurance
 
04:46:36.480 --> 04:46:38.810 align:start position:0%
bill because it's in the insurance
statute

04:46:38.810 --> 04:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:46:40.850 --> 04:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
uh is there anything else the insurance
 
04:46:42.708 --> 04:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
statute that's practice and not
 
04:46:45.230 --> 04:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
something I mean I guess it might take
 
04:46:47.448 --> 04:46:47.458 align:start position:0%
to be frank is that if it's a practice
 
04:46:49.190 --> 04:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
then you're the people you should be
 
04:46:52.730 --> 04:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
talking to the Board of Medicine and the
 
04:46:55.788 --> 04:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
medical directors of insurance companies
 
04:46:57.708 --> 04:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones that approve
 
04:47:00.110 --> 04:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
practices they're the ones who say this
 
04:47:01.910 --> 04:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
is what we're going to do it was as I
 
04:47:03.770 --> 04:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
call the cookbook you know this is what
 
04:47:06.530 --> 04:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
we do for each thing so to me that's the
 
04:47:08.930 --> 04:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
way you go not necessarily come to us
 
04:47:10.250 --> 04:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
for third-party reimburse you know
 
04:47:12.288 --> 04:47:12.298 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for something that is kind
 
04:47:15.230 --> 04:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
of fuzzy you need to get them to say yes
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is what we want to do
 
04:47:20.930 --> 04:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
with due respect Mr chair the medical
 
04:47:22.190 --> 04:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
directors of insurance companies
 
04:47:25.310 --> 04:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
certainly do authorize what practices
 
04:47:26.990 --> 04:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
they'll reimburse for
 
04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature authorizes what
 
04:47:32.030 --> 04:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
practices can occur in the state
 
04:47:35.930 --> 04:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
again we this was in Senate health
 
04:47:37.910 --> 04:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
it was and I I hear what you're saying
 
04:47:40.670 --> 04:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
about being an insurance statute I will
 
04:47:42.650 --> 04:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that I miss that that's
 
04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's on me but when it went to house
 
04:47:47.628 --> 04:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
Health initially
 
04:47:49.010 --> 04:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
we thought it was an appropriate
 
04:47:51.410 --> 04:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
placement for the bill because it was we
 
04:47:53.208 --> 04:47:53.218 align:start position:0%
saw it as a practice Bill yes there are
 
04:47:54.550 --> 04:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
a couple of insurance
 
04:47:57.530 --> 04:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
pieces that it's commented on but we saw
 
04:47:59.390 --> 04:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
this primary on this practice bill so I
 
04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
will take full responsibility for
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
missing that in my apologies
 
04:48:03.840 --> 04:48:05.208 align:start position:0%
missing that in my apologies
because

04:48:05.208 --> 04:48:05.218 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:48:07.550 --> 04:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
ever since the first day I arrived on
 
04:48:09.948 --> 04:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
this committee I've gone through every
 
04:48:12.310 --> 04:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
single type of mental health practice
 
04:48:16.190 --> 04:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
and has been a mandate that we get that
 
04:48:18.110 --> 04:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
third party reimbursement and no one's
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
ever said that was a practice Bill
 
04:48:21.350 --> 04:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
everybody says this is an insurance
 
04:48:21.360 --> 04:48:24.350 align:start position:0%
everybody says this is an insurance
mandate

04:48:24.350 --> 04:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:28.490 --> 04:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you any
 
04:48:31.670 --> 04:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
other questions for Mr dejoy see none
 
04:48:34.390 --> 04:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
I have no more cards
 
04:48:37.910 --> 04:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
we will close the public hearing
 
04:49:25.310 --> 04:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:27.948 --> 04:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
we will hear from uh
 
04:49:32.628 --> 04:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
Senator rosewald's staffer yes
 
04:49:36.110 --> 04:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
so introduce your name please
 
04:49:38.930 --> 04:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and members of
 
04:49:40.670 --> 04:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Jennifer
 
04:49:43.070 --> 04:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
Gallagher I'm Senator rosenwald's
 
04:49:44.868 --> 04:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
assistant and she has asked me to
 
04:49:46.490 --> 04:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
introduce her bill because unfortunately
 
04:49:48.050 --> 04:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
she had a conflict
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
so with your Indulgence I'd like to
 
04:49:53.930 --> 04:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate bill 243.
 
04:49:56.330 --> 04:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
I'm pleased to introduce Senate Bill 243
 
04:49:58.730 --> 04:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
to create a study committee to look at
 
04:50:00.708 --> 04:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
whether New Hampshire should consider
 
04:50:02.750 --> 04:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
moving from the federal health benefit
 
04:50:06.050 --> 04:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
exchange known as healthcare.gov
 
04:50:08.208 --> 04:50:08.218 align:start position:0%
to a state exchange for people who
 
04:50:09.770 --> 04:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
purchase health insurance in the
 
04:50:11.628 --> 04:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
individual Market
 
04:50:13.250 --> 04:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
as you recall
 
04:50:15.650 --> 04:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
when the Affordable Care Act was enacted
 
04:50:18.230 --> 04:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
13 years ago states were given a choice
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
whether to create their own exchange or
 
04:50:23.810 --> 04:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
to sign on with the federal exchange New
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire made the choice and I think it
 
04:50:27.890 --> 04:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
was the correct one to go with the
 
04:50:29.868 --> 04:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
federal exchange as a way to save money
 
04:50:32.150 --> 04:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
and administrative hurdles
 
04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
but here we are more than a decade later
 
04:50:36.770 --> 04:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
and the industry has developed
 
04:50:38.990 --> 04:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
commercial software platform solutions
 
04:50:41.330 --> 04:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
that are available to States
 
04:50:43.850 --> 04:50:43.860 align:start position:0%
these are market-tested solutions that
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
work and can save States money
 
04:50:48.708 --> 04:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire's case we could save up
 
04:50:50.628 --> 04:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
to five million dollars a year on the
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
fees we now pay to use the federal
 
04:50:52.680 --> 04:50:54.170 align:start position:0%
fees we now pay to use the federal
Exchange

04:50:54.170 --> 04:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
Exchange
 
04:50:56.690 --> 04:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
those funds which could potentially be
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
matched with federal funds could be used
 
04:51:01.310 --> 04:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
to lower health insurance premiums in
 
04:51:03.410 --> 04:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
the individual Market
 
04:51:05.690 --> 04:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
last year the Senate passed on a Voice
 
04:51:08.990 --> 04:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
vote Senate Bill 121 which directed the
 
04:51:11.208 --> 04:51:11.218 align:start position:0%
insurance department to evaluate the
 
04:51:13.610 --> 04:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
issue and determine the impact on
 
04:51:15.708 --> 04:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
premiums and whether we would achieve
 
04:51:18.050 --> 04:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
better control over the insurance market
 
04:51:21.470 --> 04:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
and possibly Better Health outcomes
 
04:51:23.868 --> 04:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
the house Commerce Committee decided to
 
04:51:26.330 --> 04:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
refer the bill for interim study and
 
04:51:28.190 --> 04:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
suggested it come back as a study
 
04:51:28.200 --> 04:51:29.448 align:start position:0%
suggested it come back as a study
committee

04:51:29.448 --> 04:51:29.458 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:51:32.510 --> 04:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
so Senate Bill 243 sets up a study
 
04:51:34.190 --> 04:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
committee to look at the risks and
 
04:51:36.770 --> 04:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
benefits of a state Exchange
 
04:51:38.690 --> 04:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I believe there
 
04:51:40.430 --> 04:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
are some folks here that are that are
 
04:51:41.930 --> 04:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
suited than myself to answer any
 
04:51:45.470 --> 04:51:45.480 align:start position:0%

okay chair we'll call him Peter bragden
 
04:52:01.730 --> 04:52:01.740 align:start position:0%

the record my name is Peter Bragdon I'm
 
04:52:13.128 --> 04:52:13.138 align:start position:0%
a senior policy advisor with Freddie's
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
strategies and I have some handouts too
 
04:52:26.208 --> 04:52:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:28.430 --> 04:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
all right and former Senate President
 
04:52:28.440 --> 04:52:33.410 align:start position:0%
all right and former Senate President
too

04:52:33.410 --> 04:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:37.850 --> 04:52:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh let's see uh so here on behalf of uh
 
04:52:42.470 --> 04:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
get insured getting short is a one of
 
04:52:43.610 --> 04:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
the several companies around the country
 
04:52:47.690 --> 04:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
that provides State exchange software as
 
04:52:50.330 --> 04:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
uh Senator rosenwald's testimony
 
04:52:52.190 --> 04:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
indicated back when the Affordable Care
 
04:52:54.230 --> 04:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
Act was first passed States had a states
 
04:52:56.390 --> 04:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
were required to put together basically
 
04:52:59.208 --> 04:52:59.218 align:start position:0%
a computer system to allow individuals
 
04:53:02.510 --> 04:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
to shop for ACA compliant insurance
 
04:53:05.330 --> 04:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
policies and the states had two options
 
04:53:07.070 --> 04:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
they could build their own system known
 
04:53:09.590 --> 04:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
as a state-based exchange or they could
 
04:53:12.050 --> 04:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
hook up with the federal exchange known
 
04:53:15.230 --> 04:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
as healthcare.gov and as as your
 
04:53:16.670 --> 04:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
chairman noted I was Senate President at
 
04:53:17.750 --> 04:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
the time when that happened I remember
 
04:53:20.090 --> 04:53:20.100 align:start position:0%
it quite well and we were all very
 
04:53:21.530 --> 04:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
concerned at the time that New Hampshire
 
04:53:23.690 --> 04:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
did not have the resources or the
 
04:53:25.850 --> 04:53:25.860 align:start position:0%
knowledge to construct their own State
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
exchange and in fact a few States who
 
04:53:30.530 --> 04:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
tried to do their own exchange back in
 
04:53:31.930 --> 04:53:31.940 align:start position:0%
the early days
 
04:53:35.208 --> 04:53:35.218 align:start position:0%
spectacularly failed at it because they
 
04:53:37.250 --> 04:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
just don't have the expertise to do it
 
04:53:40.550 --> 04:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
But Here we are now 13 years later and
 
04:53:43.190 --> 04:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
so there are 19 states that now use a
 
04:53:45.230 --> 04:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
state exchange with more added each year
 
04:53:47.448 --> 04:53:47.458 align:start position:0%
in the last few years we've had Virginia
 
04:53:49.970 --> 04:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
Maine Kentucky New Mexico Pennsylvania
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
and New Jersey have all switched to a
 
04:53:54.650 --> 04:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
state exchange next year Georgia will
 
04:53:56.448 --> 04:53:56.458 align:start position:0%
switch to a state exchange and there's
 
04:53:58.250 --> 04:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
active legislation in Texas Oregon
 
04:54:00.770 --> 04:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
Alabama and Illinois
 
04:54:02.868 --> 04:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
these are a broad spectrum of States
 
04:54:04.430 --> 04:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
they're red States they're blue States
 
04:54:06.830 --> 04:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
they're big States small states this is
 
04:54:08.510 --> 04:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
not a Dr Seuss story we won't go any
 
04:54:10.250 --> 04:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
further with the Rhymes uh but you can
 
04:54:12.050 --> 04:54:12.060 align:start position:0%
see it's very broad it's not a single
 
04:54:14.390 --> 04:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
issue and and States decide to do this
 
04:54:16.368 --> 04:54:16.378 align:start position:0%
for various reasons one it can save
 
04:54:19.430 --> 04:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
money uh two it can give local control
 
04:54:21.650 --> 04:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
over the data and design a system that
 
04:54:24.650 --> 04:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
works best for you and in fact a few
 
04:54:26.930 --> 04:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
things have been seen as benefits to it
 
04:54:30.128 --> 04:54:30.138 align:start position:0%
and those are listed probably on lines
 
04:54:33.230 --> 04:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh 13 through 18 of the bills some of
 
04:54:34.670 --> 04:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
the benefits we've seen in states that
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
switch to a state exchange are increased
 
04:54:39.708 --> 04:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
enrollment and more interestingly the
 
04:54:41.930 --> 04:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
enrollment that comes to them is a
 
04:54:43.788 --> 04:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
healthier younger population which if
 
04:54:45.708 --> 04:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
you want a healthy Insurance Market uh
 
04:54:47.090 --> 04:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
what you want to have is younger
 
04:54:48.410 --> 04:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
healthier people joining the pool
 
04:54:51.128 --> 04:54:51.138 align:start position:0%
increased enrollment reduced premiums
 
04:54:53.810 --> 04:54:53.820 align:start position:0%
economic benefits to the markets as I
 
04:54:55.250 --> 04:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned with health or healthier
 
04:54:57.770 --> 04:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
younger people joining improved access
 
04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
to data right now we use a one size fit
 
04:55:03.430 --> 04:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
all federal exchange healthcare.gov
 
04:55:05.930 --> 04:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
there's at least a one month lag in
 
04:55:07.788 --> 04:55:07.798 align:start position:0%
receiving data from them and it's not
 
04:55:09.110 --> 04:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
anything that's terribly useful for
 
04:55:11.448 --> 04:55:11.458 align:start position:0%
making policy decisions whereas if we
 
04:55:13.368 --> 04:55:13.378 align:start position:0%
had control of the data ourselves we
 
04:55:14.930 --> 04:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
could make decisions based on what we're
 
04:55:17.628 --> 04:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
seeing in the marketplace and stronger
 
04:55:18.830 --> 04:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
State control over health insurance
 
04:55:21.350 --> 04:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
reform and the item I passed out there's
 
04:55:23.690 --> 04:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
a quote at the bottom from the director
 
04:55:26.750 --> 04:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
of the Idaho State exchange focusing on
 
04:55:28.610 --> 04:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
that local control piece it's not a
 
04:55:31.010 --> 04:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits all a good example of that
 
04:55:33.948 --> 04:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
is during the covet pandemic under the
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
federal Marketplace this healthcare.gov
 
04:55:37.550 --> 04:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
states were not allowed New Hampshire
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
was not allowed to increase its open
 
04:55:41.390 --> 04:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment period other states that had
 
04:55:43.128 --> 04:55:43.138 align:start position:0%
a state exchange almost all of them
 
04:55:44.990 --> 04:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
expanded their open enrollment period
 
04:55:48.288 --> 04:55:48.298 align:start position:0%
for people to get insurance because of
 
04:55:50.330 --> 04:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
the turmoil in in the marketplace with
 
04:55:52.970 --> 04:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
respect to covet and what they saw as a
 
04:55:54.410 --> 04:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
result was as I mentioned younger
 
04:55:56.510 --> 04:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
healthier people coming into the pool
 
04:55:59.208 --> 04:55:59.218 align:start position:0%
which made it better for everybody so by
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
having some State Control you can make
 
04:56:03.230 --> 04:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
the rules so that's all well and good
 
04:56:04.850 --> 04:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
this is not a bill to mandate or to
 
04:56:06.708 --> 04:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
create a state exchange there was a bill
 
04:56:08.030 --> 04:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
last year to do that as Senator
 
04:56:09.530 --> 04:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald had testified
 
04:56:12.530 --> 04:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
and um it was deemed that that bill was
 
04:56:13.850 --> 04:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
just to direct the department to go
 
04:56:14.690 --> 04:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
ahead and do it if you think it's good
 
04:56:16.490 --> 04:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
go ahead and do it uh and this committee
 
04:56:17.868 --> 04:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
wisely felt I know there's been a good
 
04:56:19.250 --> 04:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
deal of turnover in this committee since
 
04:56:21.050 --> 04:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
then this committee wisely felt that
 
04:56:22.730 --> 04:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
wait a minute this is not a decision a
 
04:56:24.050 --> 04:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
department of the state should be making
 
04:56:27.050 --> 04:56:27.060 align:start position:0%
this is a legislative policy decision
 
04:56:28.250 --> 04:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
um but they also determined we don't
 
04:56:29.930 --> 04:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
know enough about this yet the best idea
 
04:56:31.368 --> 04:56:31.378 align:start position:0%
would be to have a study committee
 
04:56:33.410 --> 04:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
formed next year to do this and and
 
04:56:35.390 --> 04:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
hence this bill so it lays out the types
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
of things to look for
 
04:56:39.050 --> 04:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
um on lines 13 to 18 look at those
 
04:56:41.208 --> 04:56:41.218 align:start position:0%
potential benefits make sure that what I
 
04:56:43.970 --> 04:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
tell you is true uh lines 19 and 20
 
04:56:45.590 --> 04:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
should study some potential risks and
 
04:56:47.510 --> 04:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
liabilities right there's always a risk
 
04:56:50.448 --> 04:56:50.458 align:start position:0%
and reward situation and then starting
 
04:56:52.368 --> 04:56:52.378 align:start position:0%
on line 22 and working way down just
 
04:56:54.170 --> 04:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
some some special things to consider
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
what are the startup costs right there's
 
04:56:56.810 --> 04:56:56.820 align:start position:0%
going to be some money that's going to
 
04:56:59.270 --> 04:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
cost us to set this up uh some options
 
04:57:00.948 --> 04:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
to offset those costs I know the federal
 
04:57:02.390 --> 04:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
government provides a two million dollar
 
04:57:04.490 --> 04:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
Grant to states to do their own exchange
 
04:57:07.190 --> 04:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
and in many cases what you end up doing
 
04:57:09.050 --> 04:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
is doing RFP for someone to run the
 
04:57:11.030 --> 04:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
exchange it's usually like a five or six
 
04:57:13.670 --> 04:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
year contract and allowing them to put
 
04:57:15.470 --> 04:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
the startup cost into that so there's no
 
04:57:17.330 --> 04:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
upfront money from the state so there's
 
04:57:18.590 --> 04:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things that can be looked
 
04:57:20.510 --> 04:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
into most of these options you see on
 
04:57:23.750 --> 04:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
lines 23 through 30 are uh things that
 
04:57:25.550 --> 04:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
came up at last year's Committee hearing
 
04:57:27.530 --> 04:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh so we put them in here just to say
 
04:57:28.910 --> 04:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
let's make sure we look at this uh
 
04:57:30.948 --> 04:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
question was asked about well what about
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
states what states have switched from
 
04:57:34.310 --> 04:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
federal to State have any states
 
04:57:36.230 --> 04:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
switched from state to Federal yes they
 
04:57:38.090 --> 04:57:38.100 align:start position:0%
have most of them have now switched back
 
04:57:40.190 --> 04:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
to state but let's get some history of
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
it so we know we're making the right
 
04:57:43.610 --> 04:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
decision but as of now there's a robust
 
04:57:46.368 --> 04:57:46.378 align:start position:0%
competitive market of off-the-shelf
 
04:57:47.868 --> 04:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
software solutions that can be
 
04:57:49.610 --> 04:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
customized so it's not like a state has
 
04:57:51.590 --> 04:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
to go and build their own exchange
 
04:57:53.448 --> 04:57:53.458 align:start position:0%
there's products and services out there
 
04:57:55.910 --> 04:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
amongst a variety of companies and so
 
04:57:57.770 --> 04:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
anyways this bill comes about as a
 
04:58:00.170 --> 04:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
result of the proposal last year and
 
04:58:01.430 --> 04:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
this community determined really needed
 
04:58:03.850 --> 04:58:03.860 align:start position:0%
more information to make a what what is
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
certainly a legislative policy decision
 
04:58:08.990 --> 04:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
versus a decision and I don't think the
 
04:58:10.070 --> 04:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
department wants to make that position
 
04:58:12.170 --> 04:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
either they prefer that the legislature
 
04:58:14.208 --> 04:58:14.218 align:start position:0%
set the policy so
 
04:58:15.470 --> 04:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I think that's about it I'd be happy
 
04:58:19.250 --> 04:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative spear
 
04:58:25.390 --> 04:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
so there uh
 
04:58:28.850 --> 04:58:28.860 align:start position:0%
there is a software which are also
 
04:58:31.850 --> 04:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
involved I guess in that will set up the
 
04:58:35.810 --> 04:58:35.820 align:start position:0%
exchange so my question is
 
04:58:38.030 --> 04:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
the software gets tailored for this
 
04:58:40.128 --> 04:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
specific state that you're in and what
 
04:58:42.110 --> 04:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
the state's goals are and what they want
 
04:58:44.948 --> 04:58:44.958 align:start position:0%
to do but the basic part of the software
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
Remains the core of the software I guess
 
04:58:49.550 --> 04:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't change
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the software is going
 
04:58:55.310 --> 04:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
to have to get tailored for us to any
 
04:58:56.750 --> 04:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
state yeah you know what do you see as
 
04:58:58.070 --> 04:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
your experience yeah thank you for the
 
04:59:00.530 --> 04:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
question I'm not 100 sure but I I would
 
04:59:02.270 --> 04:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
say a majority of the core is the same
 
04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's a place that's a Marketplace
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
for buyers and sellers to exchange
 
04:59:08.868 --> 04:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
information about their Wares and set
 
04:59:10.610 --> 04:59:10.620 align:start position:0%
people up some of the things that do
 
04:59:13.070 --> 04:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
change though are states determine what
 
04:59:14.448 --> 04:59:14.458 align:start position:0%
their open enrollment periods are going
 
04:59:17.030 --> 04:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
to be for instance uh states can
 
04:59:18.830 --> 04:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
determine a lot of other various
 
04:59:20.628 --> 04:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
parameters but most of the ones out
 
04:59:22.010 --> 04:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
there and I represent one company that
 
04:59:23.690 --> 04:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
does this there are several
 
04:59:26.990 --> 04:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
um but I think on all of the core uh the
 
04:59:29.690 --> 04:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
core functionality is the same the same
 
04:59:32.270 --> 04:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
basic thing and then the extra bells and
 
04:59:34.190 --> 04:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
whistles are things like that the state
 
04:59:35.448 --> 04:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
wants to do
 
04:59:36.770 --> 04:59:36.780 align:start position:0%
but I don't know much more than that but
 
04:59:37.730 --> 04:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that's why
 
04:59:39.410 --> 04:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
that's listed in here is the ability of
 
04:59:41.150 --> 04:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
the state to customize it you know to
 
04:59:43.368 --> 04:59:43.378 align:start position:0%
what degree is that flexibility there
 
04:59:45.230 --> 04:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
and this by the way is this would uh
 
04:59:47.330 --> 04:59:47.340 align:start position:0%
typically and I I think it would have to
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
anyways uh if the state would decide to
 
04:59:51.708 --> 04:59:51.718 align:start position:0%
pursue this then the an RFP would be
 
04:59:52.970 --> 04:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
issued requests for proposals for
 
04:59:54.948 --> 04:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
companies to bid on doing this so I
 
04:59:56.270 --> 04:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
represented one company that does this
 
04:59:58.310 --> 04:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
this in no way guarantees that my
 
04:59:59.570 --> 04:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
company is the one that ends up being
 
05:00:02.050 --> 05:00:02.060 align:start position:0%
selected though I certainly hope it is
 
05:00:04.430 --> 05:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
05:00:06.590 --> 05:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:00:06.600 --> 05:00:07.910 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

05:00:07.910 --> 05:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:09.650 --> 05:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
I understand there would have to be an
 
05:00:12.230 --> 05:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
RFP so we wouldn't necessarily buying or
 
05:00:15.530 --> 05:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
could be buying your company software if
 
05:00:17.690 --> 05:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
we go in the direction of this bill but
 
05:00:19.850 --> 05:00:19.860 align:start position:0%
just for an example and I should say I
 
05:00:22.730 --> 05:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
speak from personal experience uh having
 
05:00:24.288 --> 05:00:24.298 align:start position:0%
been involved with this in the federal
 
05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
government if the state were to buy your
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
company software and if after our state
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
agency starts using it to um uh for a
 
05:00:39.948 --> 05:00:39.958 align:start position:0%
state exchange if the state agency then
 
05:00:42.948 --> 05:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
needed to make some kind of a change in
 
05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
the software would it be possible for
 
05:00:48.170 --> 05:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
the state agency to make that change on
 
05:00:51.770 --> 05:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
its own or if or or would the state
 
05:00:54.350 --> 05:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
agency have to go back to your company
 
05:00:57.948 --> 05:00:57.958 align:start position:0%
every single time and pay your company
 
05:01:01.368 --> 05:01:01.378 align:start position:0%
again every single time to make any
 
05:01:03.830 --> 05:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
change that needed to be made thank you
 
05:01:05.750 --> 05:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
for the question I I can't say for sure
 
05:01:07.910 --> 05:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to guess that like most
 
05:01:10.490 --> 05:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
types of software like this that any
 
05:01:12.050 --> 05:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
changes that have to make probably need
 
05:01:14.030 --> 05:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
to made by the vendor now out of college
 
05:01:16.310 --> 05:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
I started a software company uh grew it
 
05:01:18.170 --> 05:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
to the Inc 500 list of fastest growing
 
05:01:20.030 --> 05:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
companies in the country and so I'm a
 
05:01:21.410 --> 05:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
little bit familiar with the software
 
05:01:23.030 --> 05:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
development process and the key to all
 
05:01:25.490 --> 05:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
that is to meet beforehand and get all
 
05:01:27.288 --> 05:01:27.298 align:start position:0%
your specifications ironed out in
 
05:01:29.810 --> 05:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
advance so what you have is what you
 
05:01:32.208 --> 05:01:32.218 align:start position:0%
want and then when the contracts come up
 
05:01:34.190 --> 05:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
from renewal try and build in additional
 
05:01:39.070 --> 05:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:42.590 --> 05:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh would you believe uh that it is
 
05:01:47.110 --> 05:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
impossible to plan everything in advance
 
05:01:51.948 --> 05:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
uh and that an agency May in fact end up
 
05:01:54.470 --> 05:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
working with software which is very
 
05:01:57.530 --> 05:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
difficult for staff to use because it is
 
05:01:59.628 --> 05:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
so expensive to go back to the vendor
 
05:02:01.670 --> 05:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the would you believe and
 
05:02:03.470 --> 05:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
I do think that's obviously if this
 
05:02:05.628 --> 05:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
committee was uh and their wisdom chose
 
05:02:07.368 --> 05:02:07.378 align:start position:0%
to move this bill along that that would
 
05:02:08.690 --> 05:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
be one thing the study committee should
 
05:02:10.610 --> 05:02:10.620 align:start position:0%
look at is to what degree is it
 
05:02:11.930 --> 05:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
customizable and what's been the
 
05:02:14.810 --> 05:02:14.820 align:start position:0%
experience of other states with their
 
05:02:14.820 --> 05:02:16.250 align:start position:0%
experience of other states with their
vendors

05:02:16.250 --> 05:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
represent Burroughs
 
05:02:21.890 --> 05:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:02:21.900 --> 05:02:23.270 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

05:02:23.270 --> 05:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:26.270 --> 05:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
my question is I I think it's a great
 
05:02:28.910 --> 05:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
idea to study this and to see where we
 
05:02:31.070 --> 05:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
go but I'm seeing that in the bill I
 
05:02:32.690 --> 05:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
guess I'd like your opinion it's saying
 
05:02:34.368 --> 05:02:34.378 align:start position:0%
that on this committee is going to be
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Senate and three
 
05:02:37.430 --> 05:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
members of the House of Representatives
 
05:02:40.550 --> 05:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
this is a lot I mean the information is
 
05:02:43.090 --> 05:02:43.100 align:start position:0%
pretty detailed and would seem to need
 
05:02:45.830 --> 05:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
some expertise in the field and I know
 
05:02:49.190 --> 05:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
it says that they may bring people into
 
05:02:51.590 --> 05:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
um testify what not do you think that
 
05:02:54.350 --> 05:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
that lay people can can answer all these
 
05:02:56.208 --> 05:02:56.218 align:start position:0%
questions in a committee I think the
 
05:02:58.550 --> 05:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
committee can get information from
 
05:03:00.230 --> 05:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
various sources including the vendors
 
05:03:02.750 --> 05:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
including the department of insurance I
 
05:03:04.128 --> 05:03:04.138 align:start position:0%
believe the Department's testifying
 
05:03:05.750 --> 05:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
after this and there's some resources
 
05:03:07.250 --> 05:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
that they have already from some work
 
05:03:09.350 --> 05:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
they've already done so I think so it's
 
05:03:10.730 --> 05:03:10.740 align:start position:0%
um you know if they're asking the
 
05:03:13.310 --> 05:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
committee to design the software I think
 
05:03:15.530 --> 05:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
that would be a different situation but
 
05:03:16.850 --> 05:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
you're being asked and that was one of
 
05:03:18.230 --> 05:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
the situations I believe it was the
 
05:03:20.390 --> 05:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
state of Oregon uh they set up this
 
05:03:22.250 --> 05:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
exchange to develop they want to develop
 
05:03:24.110 --> 05:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
their own thing back in 2000 2014 and
 
05:03:25.368 --> 05:03:25.378 align:start position:0%
the person in charge of was a doctor
 
05:03:27.650 --> 05:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
nothing against doctors but had no
 
05:03:29.270 --> 05:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
experience in information technology and
 
05:03:31.190 --> 05:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
so this is really if you're doing that
 
05:03:33.050 --> 05:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
you would want some expertise I do think
 
05:03:34.910 --> 05:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
having served in the legislature that
 
05:03:36.650 --> 05:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
this is the exactly the type of thing
 
05:03:37.910 --> 05:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
that a legislative committee would be
 
05:03:40.070 --> 05:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
able to do with the correct information
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
being provided thank you you'd think
 
05:03:45.830 --> 05:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
with 424 members we could come up with
 
05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
four people who could
 
05:03:51.410 --> 05:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
you answering the computer it ain't me I
 
05:03:54.170 --> 05:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
just sold personal computers I know I
 
05:03:56.448 --> 05:03:56.458 align:start position:0%
think I bought him some stuff like way
 
05:03:59.090 --> 05:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
back when way back
 
05:04:02.208 --> 05:04:02.218 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you all
 
05:04:02.218 --> 05:04:02.990 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you all
right

05:04:02.990 --> 05:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:04:05.570 --> 05:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
the last card DJ
 
05:04:10.610 --> 05:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:12.708 --> 05:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:04:14.930 --> 05:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
committee I promise to go quick it's
 
05:04:16.610 --> 05:04:16.620 align:start position:0%
always tough being the last person of
 
05:04:18.890 --> 05:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
the day sitting between you and getting
 
05:04:21.230 --> 05:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
to go home or do something fun
 
05:04:21.240 --> 05:04:23.390 align:start position:0%
to go home or do something fun
potentially

05:04:23.390 --> 05:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
05:04:26.270 --> 05:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna try very hard to not be
 
05:04:28.128 --> 05:04:28.138 align:start position:0%
repetitive but
 
05:04:30.770 --> 05:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
uh former Senator bragness correct I
 
05:04:33.050 --> 05:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
think the Genesis of this bill came out
 
05:04:34.670 --> 05:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
of the discussion that took place in the
 
05:04:35.628 --> 05:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
last term
 
05:04:37.250 --> 05:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
the bill at that time would have
 
05:04:39.948 --> 05:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
directed the department to begin the
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
state down the path of a state-based
 
05:04:44.628 --> 05:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
exchange it put us in a very unusual
 
05:04:47.570 --> 05:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
situation of having to make some policy
 
05:04:49.250 --> 05:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
decisions that's typically not what
 
05:04:51.708 --> 05:04:51.718 align:start position:0%
state agencies do or at least not what
 
05:04:54.110 --> 05:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do that is that is
 
05:04:55.310 --> 05:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
your purview
 
05:04:58.310 --> 05:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
so we had pointed that out and at the
 
05:05:00.708 --> 05:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
time Senator Bradley had said okay
 
05:05:03.170 --> 05:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
you're making some good points we
 
05:05:05.628 --> 05:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate that could you go and do some
 
05:05:09.708 --> 05:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
studying for us uh and so we did and so
 
05:05:12.590 --> 05:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
I've passed out the report that we did
 
05:05:14.330 --> 05:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
as a department and the memo that
 
05:05:16.970 --> 05:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
accompanied that report
 
05:05:18.890 --> 05:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
and I guess that leads into the first
 
05:05:20.570 --> 05:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
point I would make and I would just say
 
05:05:22.910 --> 05:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
that we will partake in whatever the
 
05:05:24.708 --> 05:05:24.718 align:start position:0%
legislature directs us to do we will be
 
05:05:26.810 --> 05:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
as helpful as we possibly can
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
but if you're going to go down the path
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
of studying this again then what I would
 
05:05:33.948 --> 05:05:33.958 align:start position:0%
ask you to do is to review the study
 
05:05:36.470 --> 05:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
that we did and identify those areas
 
05:05:38.330 --> 05:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
that you feel we did not cover
 
05:05:41.208 --> 05:05:41.218 align:start position:0%
adequately or areas that that still need
 
05:05:44.930 --> 05:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
further research because I think that
 
05:05:47.570 --> 05:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
would make the exercise a lot more
 
05:05:51.170 --> 05:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
fruitful for all of you obviously the
 
05:05:53.448 --> 05:05:53.458 align:start position:0%
study was done last year it was done
 
05:05:55.670 --> 05:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
under a somewhat tight time frame I
 
05:05:57.230 --> 05:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
think Senator Bradley had given us about
 
05:05:59.810 --> 05:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
a month or two so there probably are
 
05:06:02.510 --> 05:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
some areas that you've got to look at
 
05:06:05.090 --> 05:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
I would just say though that be aware
 
05:06:07.070 --> 05:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
that transitioning to a state-based
 
05:06:09.230 --> 05:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
exchange or a state-based model is a
 
05:06:11.810 --> 05:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
complex undertaking we are as was
 
05:06:13.850 --> 05:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
mentioned 13 years into the current
 
05:06:15.890 --> 05:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
process New Hampshire's individual
 
05:06:19.070 --> 05:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
Market fluctuates between 50 000 to 55
 
05:06:21.410 --> 05:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
000 individuals it'll be interesting to
 
05:06:23.390 --> 05:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
see what happens to that number as the
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
state goes through the Medicaid
 
05:06:28.368 --> 05:06:28.378 align:start position:0%
redetermination process but for the bulk
 
05:06:30.948 --> 05:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
of those individuals there's now that 13
 
05:06:32.810 --> 05:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
years worth of experience with the
 
05:06:33.890 --> 05:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
current system
 
05:06:35.690 --> 05:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
and I think the first thing you have to
 
05:06:38.330 --> 05:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
consider is are you going to be able to
 
05:06:40.490 --> 05:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
create a model in an experience for the
 
05:06:44.090 --> 05:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
consumer that is going to be as good at
 
05:06:47.330 --> 05:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
minimum or better which is what I assume
 
05:06:49.310 --> 05:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
the goal here is
 
05:06:51.050 --> 05:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
and the states that I've talked to have
 
05:06:54.110 --> 05:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
gone down this path have told me is you
 
05:06:55.970 --> 05:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
want to go into it with clear objections
 
05:06:58.128 --> 05:06:58.138 align:start position:0%
as to what you hope to achieve
 
05:07:00.170 --> 05:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
so things like are you looking to
 
05:07:01.850 --> 05:07:01.860 align:start position:0%
increase enrollment
 
05:07:03.708 --> 05:07:03.718 align:start position:0%
are you looking to improve customer
 
05:07:06.110 --> 05:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
experience those types of broad goals
 
05:07:08.810 --> 05:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
can help guide you as you consider
 
05:07:10.970 --> 05:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is a pathway you
 
05:07:12.410 --> 05:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
want to go down
 
05:07:14.390 --> 05:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know precisely what that would
 
05:07:15.890 --> 05:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
be in New Hampshire would have to
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
probably take a look at that and see
 
05:07:20.090 --> 05:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
where the underserved populations are
 
05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
how a state-based exchange could
 
05:07:25.128 --> 05:07:25.138 align:start position:0%
potentially get into those populations
 
05:07:27.590 --> 05:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
um and and that would have to be part of
 
05:07:30.170 --> 05:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
this work as well because you
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
if you're going to tailor something you
 
05:07:33.410 --> 05:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
have to know what you're trying to
 
05:07:35.690 --> 05:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
tailor it to achieve
 
05:07:35.700 --> 05:07:36.530 align:start position:0%
tailor it to achieve
um

05:07:36.530 --> 05:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:38.990 --> 05:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
what I come back to and again we'll do
 
05:07:41.390 --> 05:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
whatever you ask us to do I think the
 
05:07:43.970 --> 05:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
last key threshold question regards
 
05:07:45.288 --> 05:07:45.298 align:start position:0%
liability and I know that that's
 
05:07:47.690 --> 05:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
something that was incorporated into one
 
05:07:50.330 --> 05:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
of the aims of the study committee as a
 
05:07:52.550 --> 05:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
result of Our Testimony in the Senate
 
05:07:54.948 --> 05:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
and that is obviously the the federal
 
05:07:56.690 --> 05:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
government currently Bears the
 
05:07:59.090 --> 05:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the exchange and in
 
05:08:01.070 --> 05:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
transitioning to a state-based exchange
 
05:08:03.650 --> 05:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
the state will then assume that
 
05:08:05.750 --> 05:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
liability to produce and maintain a
 
05:08:08.570 --> 05:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
system that is superior to the current
 
05:08:08.580 --> 05:08:10.550 align:start position:0%
system that is superior to the current
one

05:08:10.550 --> 05:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:08:13.550 --> 05:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's the goal and that's that's
 
05:08:15.230 --> 05:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
going to be the challenge how you do
 
05:08:15.240 --> 05:08:16.970 align:start position:0%
going to be the challenge how you do
that

05:08:16.970 --> 05:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:08:19.670 --> 05:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
um so just bear that in mind uh as you
 
05:08:21.530 --> 05:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
move forward with this think about some
 
05:08:23.448 --> 05:08:23.458 align:start position:0%
of those goals think about as I said
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
some of the things that you feel we
 
05:08:26.810 --> 05:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
either didn't cover or did not
 
05:08:29.448 --> 05:08:29.458 align:start position:0%
adequately cover in the report that we
 
05:08:32.090 --> 05:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
did and I think it would serve the study
 
05:08:33.650 --> 05:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
committee well to incorporate those
 
05:08:35.570 --> 05:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
things in to give them good guidance as
 
05:08:38.510 --> 05:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
to what you're looking for presumably in
 
05:08:40.128 --> 05:08:40.138 align:start position:0%
the future you'll get that report and
 
05:08:42.170 --> 05:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
you may decide to go down the path of a
 
05:08:45.230 --> 05:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
state-based exchange and I think that if
 
05:08:47.090 --> 05:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
the report is focused on what you're
 
05:08:48.590 --> 05:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
hoping to achieve it'll make that
 
05:08:50.810 --> 05:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
process better for you in the future
 
05:08:53.628 --> 05:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:08:55.128 --> 05:08:55.138 align:start position:0%
thank you DJ
 
05:08:55.138 --> 05:08:57.170 align:start position:0%
thank you DJ
um

05:08:57.170 --> 05:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
do does this report have a complete list
 
05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
of having any where the complaints of
 
05:09:05.270 --> 05:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
what our current system do we have any
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
handle on how many complaints or the
 
05:09:09.890 --> 05:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
nature of our complaints or no it's not
 
05:09:12.590 --> 05:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
issues that anybody would have no
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
no the study didn't get into that we
 
05:09:16.850 --> 05:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to do all of that but
 
05:09:19.190 --> 05:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
is that possible you could do that in
 
05:09:21.170 --> 05:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
the next week sure well one of the
 
05:09:22.310 --> 05:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
things we certainly could do is I could
 
05:09:24.170 --> 05:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
go to our consumer Division and say guys
 
05:09:25.850 --> 05:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
I'd like you to pull all of the
 
05:09:27.590 --> 05:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
complaints that we've received about the
 
05:09:29.448 --> 05:09:29.458 align:start position:0%
individual market right and then from
 
05:09:31.310 --> 05:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
there take a look at how many of those
 
05:09:33.230 --> 05:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
complaints stem from
 
05:09:35.930 --> 05:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
something to do with the right exactly
 
05:09:38.030 --> 05:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of the problem solver because I
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
would have to say to the whole committee
 
05:09:43.970 --> 05:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
um and when I first got on this
 
05:09:46.368 --> 05:09:46.378 align:start position:0%
committee we had
 
05:09:46.378 --> 05:09:47.030 align:start position:0%
committee we had
um

05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:50.448 --> 05:09:50.458 align:start position:0%
5 000 people 5 000 lives in the
 
05:09:53.208 --> 05:09:53.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:55.310 --> 05:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
um we never got I think even when we
 
05:09:59.330 --> 05:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
brought back uh uh medical underwriting
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
I think I we didn't get even up to 10.
 
05:10:05.090 --> 05:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh when Anthem was forced into the
 
05:10:07.490 --> 05:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
marketplace I think is when we started
 
05:10:10.970 --> 05:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
to Peak and they were like 12 12.5
 
05:10:14.510 --> 05:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're at 50 55 means we
 
05:10:18.590 --> 05:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
have way outdone ourselves in terms of
 
05:10:20.628 --> 05:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of this program in
 
05:10:22.730 --> 05:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
reaching New Hampshire citizens would
 
05:10:25.250 --> 05:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
you believe and would you believe that
 
05:10:27.110 --> 05:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
I'm a little
 
05:10:30.650 --> 05:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
skits about trying to throw out some the
 
05:10:33.170 --> 05:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
baby here when uh Without Really knowing
 
05:10:35.990 --> 05:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
that there's some reason fundamental
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
problem with our software with our
 
05:10:40.970 --> 05:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
system given that success that we have
 
05:10:43.128 --> 05:10:43.138 align:start position:0%
had here in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
I would believe that you believe that
 
05:10:46.080 --> 05:10:47.410 align:start position:0%
I would believe that you believe that
that

05:10:47.410 --> 05:10:47.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:10:50.448 --> 05:10:50.458 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert
 
05:10:53.350 --> 05:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
um I have a high skeptical level when uh
 
05:10:56.810 --> 05:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
transferring privatizing a federal
 
05:10:59.930 --> 05:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
government policy so I'm a department
 
05:11:02.750 --> 05:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
and so I'm would be interested in
 
05:11:05.570 --> 05:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
knowing uh or getting some unbiased
 
05:11:08.930 --> 05:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
opinion as to uh how well
 
05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
the existing
 
05:11:15.650 --> 05:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
system has operated and and like like
 
05:11:17.750 --> 05:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
the chair I
 
05:11:17.760 --> 05:11:19.310 align:start position:0%
the chair I
um

05:11:19.310 --> 05:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:22.670 --> 05:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
it will be very hard to convince me that
 
05:11:25.270 --> 05:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
we should take on this responsibility
 
05:11:29.030 --> 05:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
and privatize it and end up having to
 
05:11:32.350 --> 05:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
pay for a private for-profit company
 
05:11:35.868 --> 05:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
whereas we apparently have a fairly
 
05:11:38.868 --> 05:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
decent system already in place from the
 
05:11:40.490 --> 05:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
05:11:42.890 --> 05:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
uh and so I
 
05:11:46.490 --> 05:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
just just out there would you believe uh
 
05:11:48.288 --> 05:11:48.298 align:start position:0%
I I would I have to do you believe he
 
05:11:50.650 --> 05:11:50.660 align:start position:0%
agrees with me yeah
 
05:11:53.208 --> 05:11:53.218 align:start position:0%
I agree with the charity
 
05:11:56.270 --> 05:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
I've done something special today okay
 
05:11:58.610 --> 05:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
representing Yemen thank you Mr chair
 
05:11:59.810 --> 05:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
and thank you commissioner for
 
05:12:01.730 --> 05:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
testifying to us
 
05:12:01.740 --> 05:12:02.930 align:start position:0%
testifying to us
um

05:12:02.930 --> 05:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
my question was about your report so I'm
 
05:12:09.288 --> 05:12:09.298 align:start position:0%
fixated on the the date of the report
 
05:12:12.850 --> 05:12:12.860 align:start position:0%
due in the bill so it's November 1st
 
05:12:15.948 --> 05:12:15.958 align:start position:0%
2023. so just knowing the legislative
 
05:12:18.050 --> 05:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
process the bill might get signed June
 
05:12:19.310 --> 05:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
or July
 
05:12:21.708 --> 05:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
it takes a month or two or sometimes
 
05:12:24.350 --> 05:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
three to help Point people it's only two
 
05:12:27.288 --> 05:12:27.298 align:start position:0%
maybe three months tops that this study
 
05:12:29.090 --> 05:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
commission would have and it's only
 
05:12:30.770 --> 05:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
three well actually actually this is
 
05:12:32.990 --> 05:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
done because it's only legislators yeah
 
05:12:34.610 --> 05:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
so and they would get it pointed pretty
 
05:12:36.650 --> 05:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
quickly yeah so it just means
 
05:12:38.090 --> 05:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
legislators are willing to work during
 
05:12:41.270 --> 05:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
the summer oh okay okay but it's it's
 
05:12:43.490 --> 05:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
three house reps in one Center yeah and
 
05:12:45.708 --> 05:12:45.718 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out the
 
05:12:48.350 --> 05:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
potential workload compared to what you
 
05:12:50.330 --> 05:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
went through in the department how many
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
people worked on this how long did it
 
05:12:53.090 --> 05:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
take what kind of resources did it
 
05:12:53.100 --> 05:12:53.810 align:start position:0%
take what kind of resources did it
require

05:12:53.810 --> 05:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
require
 
05:12:55.550 --> 05:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
so it's a very good question so as
 
05:12:57.650 --> 05:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the report we did use one
 
05:13:00.830 --> 05:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
of our contracted folks to help us with
 
05:13:02.868 --> 05:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
the report we had to do that because of
 
05:13:05.530 --> 05:13:05.540 align:start position:0%
the tight timeline we we could not have
 
05:13:08.570 --> 05:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
put a report of of that quality as short
 
05:13:12.470 --> 05:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
as it is in that amount of time I would
 
05:13:14.990 --> 05:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
suspect that a similar Dynamic would
 
05:13:16.970 --> 05:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
probably unfold here the legislators
 
05:13:19.368 --> 05:13:19.378 align:start position:0%
would probably call our department in
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
for some expertise and we would turn
 
05:13:23.570 --> 05:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
around and ask our contractors for some
 
05:13:27.288 --> 05:13:27.298 align:start position:0%
help as well so we'll try to move as
 
05:13:28.970 --> 05:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible
 
05:13:32.628 --> 05:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
but I think that given the enormity of
 
05:13:34.730 --> 05:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
and and the number of things to consider
 
05:13:37.128 --> 05:13:37.138 align:start position:0%
I don't know that you want to rush you
 
05:13:38.270 --> 05:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
know I think there are a number of
 
05:13:39.708 --> 05:13:39.718 align:start position:0%
different analysis representative
 
05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
Herbert brought up a point you know if
 
05:13:43.850 --> 05:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
you're looking to increase enrollment
 
05:13:45.530 --> 05:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
and of course I think that's a goal that
 
05:13:47.510 --> 05:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
we all share we want as many people to
 
05:13:49.190 --> 05:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
have coverage in New Hampshire as
 
05:13:49.200 --> 05:13:50.150 align:start position:0%
have coverage in New Hampshire as
possible

05:13:50.150 --> 05:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
possible
 
05:13:51.650 --> 05:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
I think you've also got to appreciate
 
05:13:54.050 --> 05:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
what does that look like exactly so you
 
05:13:57.110 --> 05:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
have younger folks who are presumably on
 
05:13:59.390 --> 05:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
their parents Insurance until 26 or
 
05:14:02.208 --> 05:14:02.218 align:start position:0%
they're in the the chip program
 
05:14:04.730 --> 05:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
so that's that population then you've
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
got obviously seniors in New Hampshire
 
05:14:08.030 --> 05:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
is a is an older state so you've got
 
05:14:10.430 --> 05:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
your Medicare population then you've got
 
05:14:13.070 --> 05:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
your Medicaid population and obviously
 
05:14:14.270 --> 05:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's going through a little bit of a
 
05:14:15.670 --> 05:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
transition as redetermined happen
 
05:14:18.230 --> 05:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
redetermination happens so what is the
 
05:14:21.230 --> 05:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
total pool of people given us State the
 
05:14:23.270 --> 05:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
size of New Hampshire 1.35 million
 
05:14:25.430 --> 05:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
people approximately you know what is
 
05:14:27.070 --> 05:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
the pool of people that you are looking
 
05:14:29.868 --> 05:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
to get because as we know the vast
 
05:14:31.368 --> 05:14:31.378 align:start position:0%
majority of folks get their coverage
 
05:14:33.650 --> 05:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
through their employer so what's left
 
05:14:35.330 --> 05:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
you know you'll want to understand what
 
05:14:37.850 --> 05:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
is that number who's going to track that
 
05:14:39.590 --> 05:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
out because I remember when I was on the
 
05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
board of healthy kids the last number I
 
05:14:43.430 --> 05:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
heard was 120
 
05:14:46.490 --> 05:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
there's 120 000 New Hampshire citizens
 
05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
who had no coverage whatsoever yeah and
 
05:14:50.448 --> 05:14:50.458 align:start position:0%
the question is how long ago was that
 
05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
was it that was a while ago yeah that
 
05:14:53.930 --> 05:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
was that before after the state expanded
 
05:14:56.448 --> 05:14:56.458 align:start position:0%
medicaid oh yeah okay yeah this is when
 
05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
they asked chip because you know the
 
05:14:59.330 --> 05:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
kids we were folded out and rolled it
 
05:15:01.190 --> 05:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
into the foundation right so I know
 
05:15:02.690 --> 05:15:02.700 align:start position:0%
there's some there are some buddies out
 
05:15:04.070 --> 05:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
there who've been doing the survey
 
05:15:06.050 --> 05:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
because I get the survey every once in a
 
05:15:08.510 --> 05:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
while they call me on my phone but you
 
05:15:10.070 --> 05:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
know it so it would be interesting to
 
05:15:12.170 --> 05:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
get that number also yep you'd want the
 
05:15:13.190 --> 05:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
most you should be able to get that
 
05:15:14.628 --> 05:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
number pretty quickly we probably could
 
05:15:16.070 --> 05:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
but that's yet another example of
 
05:15:17.510 --> 05:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
something that you want to want to
 
05:15:18.890 --> 05:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
consider absolutely and then once you've
 
05:15:20.448 --> 05:15:20.458 align:start position:0%
got that population you're going to want
 
05:15:23.330 --> 05:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
to understand you know okay do we have
 
05:15:26.390 --> 05:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
55 000 of those people covered great
 
05:15:29.330 --> 05:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
we'll move on so what's left at that
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
point and what are the particular
 
05:15:33.350 --> 05:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
characteristics of that demographic in
 
05:15:34.910 --> 05:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
that population
 
05:15:37.310 --> 05:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
and why are we not able to reach them
 
05:15:39.170 --> 05:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
today with the current system number one
 
05:15:41.330 --> 05:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
and then number two if you move to a
 
05:15:43.490 --> 05:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
state-based exchange with some of the
 
05:15:45.530 --> 05:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
modules that you can tailor is it will
 
05:15:47.770 --> 05:15:47.780 align:start position:0%
it be effective in reaching those people
 
05:15:50.288 --> 05:15:50.298 align:start position:0%
those are all the types of
 
05:15:52.610 --> 05:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
considerations that I think if you want
 
05:15:54.230 --> 05:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
to approach
 
05:15:56.090 --> 05:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
whether or not to go or no go in the
 
05:15:57.410 --> 05:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
future you're going to want to have all
 
05:15:59.810 --> 05:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
of that information at your disposal
 
05:16:01.430 --> 05:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah because I always heard there was a
 
05:16:04.730 --> 05:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
10 naysayers they'll just won't will do
 
05:16:08.030 --> 05:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
anything but yeah I think
 
05:16:08.040 --> 05:16:10.788 align:start position:0%
anything but yeah I think
spirited

05:16:10.788 --> 05:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
spirited
 
05:16:13.788 --> 05:16:13.798 align:start position:0%
okay no
 
05:16:15.590 --> 05:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
um this is probably just uh would you
 
05:16:18.230 --> 05:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
believe but I I I I think there are many
 
05:16:19.610 --> 05:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
people that are not enrolled because
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
they can't afford it even with with acas
 
05:16:26.770 --> 05:16:26.780 align:start position:0%
so if they can come up with a you know a
 
05:16:29.628 --> 05:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
you know a better alternative a cheaper
 
05:16:31.850 --> 05:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
alternative but still cover as much as
 
05:16:34.368 --> 05:16:34.378 align:start position:0%
you know ACA then
 
05:16:36.890 --> 05:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
sure I mean if the overhead to to do it
 
05:16:39.110 --> 05:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
is cheaper that's obviously a plus I
 
05:16:40.490 --> 05:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
don't know how much of that would
 
05:16:42.948 --> 05:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
actually work its way into premiums for
 
05:16:45.530 --> 05:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
the consumer that would that would have
 
05:16:47.330 --> 05:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
to and we subsidize it as it is the
 
05:16:49.250 --> 05:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
state already subsidized yep you know
 
05:16:50.510 --> 05:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
obviously the federal government has
 
05:16:52.368 --> 05:16:52.378 align:start position:0%
enhanced the the financial supports to
 
05:16:54.650 --> 05:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
people uh in recent years the state's
 
05:16:57.890 --> 05:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
1332 waiver uh has been highly effective
 
05:16:59.628 --> 05:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
in bringing premiums down in the
 
05:17:01.430 --> 05:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
individual Market
 
05:17:05.030 --> 05:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
um I I know it's a hard one for you
 
05:17:06.650 --> 05:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about that in a few
 
05:17:08.690 --> 05:17:08.700 align:start position:0%
more years representative hunt
 
05:17:08.700 --> 05:17:09.410 align:start position:0%
more years representative hunt
um

05:17:09.410 --> 05:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:12.288 --> 05:17:12.298 align:start position:0%
you know but you know to that point you
 
05:17:14.750 --> 05:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
know I'll take savings wherever I can
 
05:17:15.890 --> 05:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
find them and I'm sure that that's a
 
05:17:17.750 --> 05:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
philosophy that you all share the
 
05:17:20.510 --> 05:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
question is does it uh does it
 
05:17:22.970 --> 05:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
counterbalance the liability and does it
 
05:17:24.288 --> 05:17:24.298 align:start position:0%
actually end up working its way into
 
05:17:26.030 --> 05:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
premiums in a way that substantively
 
05:17:28.250 --> 05:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
lowers costs for consumers to a point
 
05:17:29.868 --> 05:17:29.878 align:start position:0%
where they're motivated to go and get
 
05:17:29.878 --> 05:17:33.530 align:start position:0%
where they're motivated to go and get
coverage

05:17:33.530 --> 05:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:33.540 --> 05:17:35.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:17:35.590 --> 05:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:17:38.690 --> 05:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
representative priscelli
 
05:17:40.250 --> 05:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
05:17:42.410 --> 05:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
study Commission and would probably need
 
05:17:45.350 --> 05:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
some significant expertise in the area
 
05:17:48.708 --> 05:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
so how much would it cost to hire the
 
05:17:50.750 --> 05:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
Consultants that would be required to
 
05:17:53.390 --> 05:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
really have a study that has some
 
05:17:55.368 --> 05:17:55.378 align:start position:0%
accurate information that we could act
 
05:17:57.650 --> 05:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
on well it would all depend on the scope
 
05:17:59.628 --> 05:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
it would depend on the scope of the work
 
05:18:01.190 --> 05:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
that you're looking for obviously the
 
05:18:02.690 --> 05:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
larger the scope the more would be
 
05:18:04.750 --> 05:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
needed I don't know what our current
 
05:18:07.670 --> 05:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
line is with our consultants if you
 
05:18:09.670 --> 05:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
wanted us to dip into our
 
05:18:13.010 --> 05:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
funding for that that would have to be
 
05:18:15.230 --> 05:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
determined by the committee I think we
 
05:18:16.970 --> 05:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
would probably need some guy some
 
05:18:18.770 --> 05:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
something for the subcommittee on that
 
05:18:18.780 --> 05:18:20.570 align:start position:0%
something for the subcommittee on that
subject

05:18:20.570 --> 05:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
subject
 
05:18:24.590 --> 05:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
but this is uh we we do assess insurance
 
05:18:24.600 --> 05:18:26.090 align:start position:0%
but this is uh we we do assess insurance
companies

05:18:26.090 --> 05:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
companies
 
05:18:30.650 --> 05:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
and pays for this fund but be aware that
 
05:18:33.110 --> 05:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
you already are potentially looking at
 
05:18:35.690 --> 05:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
two bills today that will also be
 
05:18:38.270 --> 05:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
tapping into that fund for them to do
 
05:18:40.550 --> 05:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
that financial analysis the two bills we
 
05:18:43.190 --> 05:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
heard today to use the Murphy Law
 
05:18:43.200 --> 05:18:45.288 align:start position:0%
heard today to use the Murphy Law
so

05:18:45.288 --> 05:18:45.298 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:18:49.490 --> 05:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much and yes thank you
 
05:18:54.128 --> 05:18:54.138 align:start position:0%
so we'll give Peter one more try
 
05:18:57.530 --> 05:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
for all time's sake no
 
05:18:59.208 --> 05:18:59.218 align:start position:0%
no thank you Mr chairman I forgot uh
 
05:19:00.350 --> 05:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
probably the most important thing I was
 
05:19:01.490 --> 05:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
looking at my notes and I looked away
 
05:19:04.010 --> 05:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
and then ah I missed it so uh and
 
05:19:07.070 --> 05:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
talking about the finances so uh to for
 
05:19:09.948 --> 05:19:09.958 align:start position:0%
the privilege of using healthcare.gov uh
 
05:19:12.310 --> 05:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
the federal government charges a 2.75
 
05:19:16.190 --> 05:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
Commission on everything sold on that uh
 
05:19:17.448 --> 05:19:17.458 align:start position:0%
experience has shown in other states
 
05:19:19.310 --> 05:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
that the state exchanges can run for
 
05:19:21.470 --> 05:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
about half of that so in New Hampshire's
 
05:19:23.030 --> 05:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
case that would be about a four million
 
05:19:25.190 --> 05:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
dollar savings uh the federal government
 
05:19:27.470 --> 05:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
offers a three to one sometimes four to
 
05:19:29.510 --> 05:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
one match if you take the money saved on
 
05:19:32.628 --> 05:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
The Exchange and plowed into areas that
 
05:19:34.730 --> 05:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
either further reduce premiums or
 
05:19:36.708 --> 05:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
increase enrollment so we just mentioned
 
05:19:39.770 --> 05:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
the 1332 waiver which is funded by a
 
05:19:42.050 --> 05:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
basically a tax on insurance policies
 
05:19:44.208 --> 05:19:44.218 align:start position:0%
it's possible that you could structure
 
05:19:45.530 --> 05:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
something where you take the savings
 
05:19:47.390 --> 05:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
from a state exchange get the federal
 
05:19:50.930 --> 05:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
match offset those Savings in and not
 
05:19:52.970 --> 05:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
half the tax uh all policies in the
 
05:19:54.410 --> 05:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
state so there's there's some there's
 
05:19:55.550 --> 05:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
things that can be done to help reduce
 
05:19:57.530 --> 05:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
insurance rates for everybody including
 
05:20:00.110 --> 05:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
those on the inch on the um individual
 
05:20:02.448 --> 05:20:02.458 align:start position:0%
Market uh but that is there there's a
 
05:20:04.910 --> 05:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
2.75 charge it's been as high as three
 
05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
and a half percent
 
05:20:08.270 --> 05:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
um they did bring it down and they
 
05:20:10.310 --> 05:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
brought down to 2.75 so it's been as low
 
05:20:13.310 --> 05:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
as 2.25 so uh there is a potential
 
05:20:15.890 --> 05:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
leveraging of significant dollars that
 
05:20:17.810 --> 05:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
can be used to reduce premiums or expand
 
05:20:19.730 --> 05:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
coverage so just want I forgot to point
 
05:20:22.190 --> 05:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
that out that's a good point thank you
 
05:20:25.310 --> 05:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
okay we're all set I will close the
 
05:20:54.530 --> 05:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:09.050 --> 05:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
