minute

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%

start with the public hearing on HB 1179
 
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
hearing um we'll ask up representative
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:41.150 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman
 
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
committee my name is representative
 
00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:48.519 align:start position:0%
Horan I represent Farmington and
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
straford County district
 
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
one uh the paperwork that I'm handing
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
out is the worksheet from the original
 
00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 1179 prior to the amendment and
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
then the
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
information sheet that follows it is the
 
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
adjustment based on the amendment as I
 
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.389 align:start position:0%
adjustment based on the amendment as I
understand

00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
it originally the uh HB
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
1179 uh was requesting free entry to the
 
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.630 align:start position:0%
1179 uh was requesting free entry to the
state

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
Parx for all retired military not
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
restricted by service or
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
Rank and then the amendment now that
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
that was to the tune of about
 
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.829 align:start position:0%
that was to the tune of about
$115,000

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
$115,000
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
and uh that included both retirees from
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Ro uh New Hampshire uh
 
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
based on information provided by state
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
parks which indicated that was where the
 
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
primary uh visitors came
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
from uh then as it I read the amendment
 
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
here it seems to eliminate the
 
00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts residents and restricts it
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire residents but adds the
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
spouses or surviving spouses of the
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
retirees which knocks that 15,000 down
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
to about
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
5,000 uh I would also mention that
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
the financial note indicates
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
316,000 I think it was
 
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
originally and I believe that number
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
actually included the number
 
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
of uh programs that offer free
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
admittance not necessarily associated
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
with the plan that we were
 
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
offering so as rather than 300 61,000
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about a few thousand
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
to add these folks uh to that $2 million
 
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
budget and that's it in a
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
nutshell I'd be happy to take any
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
questions I did you say there was an
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
amendment or is or not there's no
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
amendment to this right I'm looking at
 
00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:54.629 align:start position:0%
amendment to this right I'm looking at
there

00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
is okay you have not seen an
 
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
amendment okay this is what I took off
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
your shelf I think I only all it
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
reflects the amendment yes what we have
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
is as amended by the
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
house but the fisc note is
 
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.470 align:start position:0%
house but the fisc note is
not

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
so HB
 
00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:23.959 align:start position:0%
1179 as originally uh written is uh
 
00:12:23.959 --> 00:12:26.030 align:start position:0%
1179 as originally uh written is uh
roughly

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
$155,000 and that includes all retired
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
military regardless of service and rank
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
and it has uh retirees from
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire follow
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
up so it that's with the what we're
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
looking at with the amendment that that
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
was made by the house because the
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
original amend the original fiscal note
 
00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:57.189 align:start position:0%
original amend the original fiscal note
says

00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
361 million right the original physical
 
00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:04.519 align:start position:0%
note I believe provided by state parks
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
included a number of their free
 
00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
admittance programs not it wasn't
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
limited to just the uh the retirees that
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
we were dealing with or that were
 
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
requesting free admittance
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
for looking at the in the math the
 
00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:21.079 align:start position:0%
paperwork that I shows the math that we
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
use which is a little different than
 
00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:24.519 align:start position:0%
what the state Parx
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
used uh and we based that on the
 
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
information that state Parx Prov Ed in
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
2019 because that was the most current
 
00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:38.790 align:start position:0%
2019 because that was the most current
information

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:40.839 align:start position:0%
available so I thought you were dealing
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
with the amendment because it was
 
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
sitting on your table over here so I
 
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
think we do have that yeah if if you're
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
not dealing with that then we're talking
 
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.990 align:start position:0%
not dealing with that then we're talking
uh

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
$116,000 uh just under
 
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
$16,000 for the retirees from
 
00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.430 align:start position:0%
$16,000 for the retirees from
Massachusetts

00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
and New
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you take into consideration
 
00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:06.759 align:start position:0%
the amendment the amendment seems to
 
00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:08.710 align:start position:0%
the amendment the amendment seems to
restrict

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
restrict
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh the bill to New Hampshire
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
retirees spouses and surviving spouses
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
which cuts that $15,000 down to about
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
five in either
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
case seems like a reasonable
 
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.310 align:start position:0%
case seems like a reasonable
request

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
I have a
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
question follow
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
up so when you did this um revised
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
estimate that you just mentioned did you
 
00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:47.079 align:start position:0%
take into account that some percentage
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
of those retirees are in the category of
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
being over 65 which are already free yes
 
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.670 align:start position:0%
being over 65 which are already free yes
okay

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Ames did you have
 
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
no um anybody
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
um well maybe we have some people here
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
from the park
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
service are you anybody uh what did the
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
Park Service have to say about this
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
since they have a dedicated fund
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
and can't spend outside of it for
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
renovations I they were at the original
 
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh don't quote me but
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
basically he indicated that that 361,000
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
could have been revised it could have
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
been a much lower number my
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
understanding of that number is it
 
00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
reflects all their uh free admittance
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
programs all not just the little bit
 
00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about about so our
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
segment based on the numbers that we
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
came up with using the
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
2019 stats was just over
 
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
$15,000 for the
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
retirees and it and it's limited solely
 
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts and well it's it's open
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
to all retirees but they indicated state
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
parks indicated that the majority of
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
their visitors come from Massachusetts
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire so that's what we base
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
the numbers on
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
but now what we have is just for New
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but including spouses that we
 
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
have no way of knowing that is what the
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
amendment reflects and that is it now
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
because of that requirement for New
 
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residency it eliminates the
 
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts residents
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
retirees uh and limits it to military
 
00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
retirees that's qualified
 
00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
retirees uh to 20 years or more give or
 
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
take uh the spouses of those military
 
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
and surviving
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
spouses uh in the number in in looking
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
at the amendment and based on the number
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
and limiting it to New Hampshire
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
residents that cuts that cost down to
 
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.230 align:start position:0%
residents that cuts that cost down to
5,000

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
5,000
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
bucks and some
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
change you're saying it cuts it down to
 
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
5,000 from this from 15 from 15 and this
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
360 361,000 was when Massachusetts was
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
included that that
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
361,000 was a number provided uh that I
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
believe I can't confirm this but I
 
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
believe that included State Park's total
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
expense or sacrifice for uh free entry
 
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:50.919 align:start position:0%
programs a number of programs not just
 
00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
mine R Alman Mr chairman I really think
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
we ought to have the Park Service
 
00:17:57.679 --> 00:17:58.990 align:start position:0%
we ought to have the Park Service
explain

00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
explain
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
their original fiscal note which uh
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
126,000 if it's if we ignore the
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
spouses where's your 126,000 coming from
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
it's uh from their the formula that
 
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
they'd put
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
in about on the
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
9,533 military
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
retirees on and
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
an average visits per person of
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
2.65 per year and uh Park admission fee
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
of $5 which is the highest it's for the
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
most popular
 
00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:45.070 align:start position:0%
most popular
parks

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
parks
 
00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:48.039 align:start position:0%
okay representa spillsbury
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
so uh representative organ one of the uh
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
papers you've handed out is a memo from
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
Eric power I guess and uh
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
that seems to indicate that instead of
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
2.65 visits per
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
member there would be more likely
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
0136 visits per member so that instead
 
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.270 align:start position:0%
0136 visits per member so that instead
of

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
27,2 54 estimated visits it's
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
8,246 it would seem that accounts for uh
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
the Lion Share of the reduction would
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
you am I interpreting that correctly
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.909 align:start position:0%
that is
correct

00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
and therefore what that would bring the
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
cost to around
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
5,677 and well I have a vague
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
recollection that that's what I saw in
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
the committee report when this came to
 
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:45.799 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:19:45.799 --> 00:19:53.110 align:start position:0%
the house
floor

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:02.029 align:start position:0%
 
else

00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:03.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh did you have something
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
else just one more thing on the uh on
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
the 2.65 visits that's uh my
 
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that is that they were
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
including all the military type visits
 
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts in New Hampshire our
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
number reflects only the retire rats
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
0.136 is strictly retirees does not
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
include any other
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
group okay that's all I
 
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
have thank you thank you is there anyone
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
1179 okay seeing none I'm going to close
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
why why is it there twice I don't
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:34.830 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open the public
 
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:42.279 align:start position:0%
1391 and um we'll hear from the
 
00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
uh Prime
 
00:21:45.159 --> 00:21:48.549 align:start position:0%
uh Prime
sponsor

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
Coker thank you Mr chairman uh my name
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
is Matt CER I represent bellnap second
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
district town of Meredith and um HB 1391
 
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
is a bill that basically allows um new
 
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles to be inspected in their second
 
00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
year after uh purchase so just a quick
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
example would be my birthday's in March
 
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
so if I bought a car right now the next
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
a new car like this month the next time
 
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
I need to get an inspected would be in
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
March in 2026 and um there is a fiscal
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
note on this uh bill it's um if you look
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
at it it it shows about the $270 or
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
$270,000 loss of Revenue um and that's
 
00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
due to there's going to be about 83
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
fewer inspections every year when this
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
bill uh gets um implemented um so if you
 
00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:45.799 align:start position:0%
look at it the way they got to that is
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
83,000 and right now a sticker costs um
 
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.669 align:start position:0%
83,000 and right now a sticker costs um
$325

00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
$325
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
so you
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
if if you we have a contract with Gordon
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
Derby that's that's up at the end of
 
00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
this year and my understanding is that
 
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
that could be renegotiated so the simple
 
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
the way that I look at it is if you add
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
about 25 cents per um inspection sticker
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to make up for the revenue
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
completely and uh this would be a good
 
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
time to do it since the the contract is
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
coming up and from a policy standpoint
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
the house and the policy committee
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
looked at this and said there's no
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
safety issue uh with this bill so I
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
would just hate to see a revenue issue
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
cause a problem with it because if you
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
look at $40 per inspection which is
 
00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
about what I would say is about average
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
at 25 cents more on a sticker isn't
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to make a huge difference um and
 
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.190 align:start position:0%
going to make a huge difference um and
that

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
$40 amongst the 83,000 inspections would
 
00:23:52.029 --> 00:23:52.039 align:start position:0%
cost our citizens $3.3 million so it's
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
that you know I'd hate to see this bill
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh run into issues when it's 26 or
 
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
$270,000 worth of Revenue and it costs
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers 3.3 million so I'm uh open
 
00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:05.799 align:start position:0%
to any questions thank
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
you repres
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
elme thank you uh this bordon gardy did
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
you say Gordon Derby yep there I I have
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
no idea how to spell at to look it up
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
but uh is this the company that makes
 
00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
the stickers they have the contract from
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:30.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.350 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
this follow up yeah is this written into
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
law somewhere what the sticker price is
 
00:24:38.669 --> 00:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't believe it is I think it's
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
just negotia in the contract but I'd
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
have to I I don't know that for for sure
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
I think there's somebody here that might
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
be able to speak on that a little bit
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
more detail hope so thank you
 
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.389 align:start position:0%
more detail hope so thank you
representative

00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.789 --> 00:24:53.799 align:start position:0%
ducet thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
question may not be something you can
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
answer directly maybe some IND industry
 
00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:05.799 align:start position:0%
folk can can answer but I I find it hard
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
to believe that a vendor would pass on a
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
an increase of 23 or 25 cents onto a
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
sticker that costs on average 40 50
 
00:25:18.669 --> 00:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
bucks so what what I'm hearing from you
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
is we save our constituents in excess of
 
00:25:21.679 --> 00:25:22.549 align:start position:0%
is we save our constituents in excess of
$3

00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
$3
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
million yes we save them 3.3 million and
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
I I would be shocked if that got pass on
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
to cons maybe we'll hear testimony but
 
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious about the 20 it seems
 
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799 align:start position:0%
you uh anybody
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
else saying none thank you oh yes so I
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
have a question about in the the new
 
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph you know the last part of the
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
bill yes it says by a natural person as
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
the first owner does that mean that this
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply
 
00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:02.919 align:start position:0%
to vehicles that are owned by a company
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
no we added um we added some language in
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
here at some point here let me let me
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
um basically we added language in here
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh at some point to make sure it applied
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
to a uh
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
company you can you show me where that
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
U so if you look at um page uh which
 
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
page is this uh page three if you look
 
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
at line Oh by a corporation yeah yeah a
 
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle purchase or a um purchase prior
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
of the bond of year by a corporation as
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
a first owner should be shall be exempt
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
from the inspection to the last day so
 
00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
it's so it so it does not exempt
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
um so this extra time time applies to
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
fleet vehicles also which could have
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
significant mileage on them yeah well
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
and if you own a fleet of vehicles that
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
does a that has a lot of mileage on it
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to be I'm assuming I mean
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
just from good good corporate policy
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to be inspecting them and
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
and and taking care of them because if
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
you're putting a lot of mileage on a
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
fleet vehicle that means you need the
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle so I I doubt they're going to
 
00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.110 align:start position:0%
vehicle so I I doubt they're going to
neglect

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
neglect
 
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
it so follow up well that
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
that argument would apply to anybody I
 
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
mean how is that different I I I would
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
said the the
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
fleet does not
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
include um Vehicles purchased by
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
corporations the you know that's and
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
that that was an argument but
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
the if you look at the data I mean I've
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
had when I spoke on the floor about that
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
I talked about the data there there is
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
no um there there's no appreciable
 
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
difference in states with inspection
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
programs and without inspection programs
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
and I'm not even we're we're really only
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
focusing on brand new vehicles so it's
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
going to have even less of an effect and
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
in two if you look at insurance
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
companies I to my knowledge I looked in
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of places i' never I I could not
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
find where an insurance company required
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
somebody to inspect their vehicle and if
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
I were an insurance company and I'm
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
doing the numbers on that and thought
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspections vastly improv safety
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
I would probably require a company to
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
inspect them either way so this just
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
there's just not a lot of data that um
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
that vehicle inspections actually do
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
safety okay thank you thank
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
you you have a question yes just a quick
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify and I know this
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
this is a the policy has been set by the
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
house so we're we're we're really
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
working on the numbers and I missed a
 
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
number that you said I know that the the
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal note says this is going to
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
cost approximately
 
00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
$269,000 a year for loss of sticker
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
sales you said and and I know my
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
colleague down the end said reiterated
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
this but um I just wanted to make sure
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
it was it the the the consumers will
 
00:29:21.789 --> 00:29:21.799 align:start position:0%
save $3 million per year in in
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
inspections with yeah with fewer than 83
 
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
with 83,000 inspections out you know off
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
their the sticker price such a small
 
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
portion of the inspection but yeah
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
they're going to save a ton of money I
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure I understood it
 
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
mrman next I have
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.710 align:start position:0%

00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
Friedman
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman committee members uh Aubrey
 
00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
Friedman I live in Bridgewater private
 
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
citizen I speak in support of this bill
 
00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:10.519 align:start position:0%
um I lived in California till 2018 and
 
00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
believe me that state does not miss a
 
00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:16.039 align:start position:0%
beat when it comes to any kind of rule
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
regulation any possible thing they have
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
everything there and I never had a
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspection there uh that was
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
mandated by the state um until I
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
actually came here too uh New Hampshire
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
I was like kind of surprised there they
 
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
do have the smog inspections every two
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
years but even then they got rid of that
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
for the newer cars it's just not
 
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
necessary to have the inspections and
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
that's that and by the way when you take
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
your car in for maintenance they're
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
always finding things anyway so in a way
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
it kind of gets inspected every time you
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
take it in for maintenance there's
 
00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:53.559 align:start position:0%
always something um new cars are very
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
expensive and if you can eliminate the
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
that first first uh year which is
 
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
totally unnecessary then it helps the
 
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
car owner a little bit so I think that's
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
a good thing and then lastly on the
 
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it's a very insignificant
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
amount if you look at the highway fund
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that uh other fund I forget what it
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
is the total amount that they pull in
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
every year it's very it's like
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
0.008% and 0.001% very tiny percentages
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure the state will survive
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
without them and they can just tighten
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
their belt a little bit and those are
 
00:31:29.789 --> 00:31:29.799 align:start position:0%
the reasons I support the bill I think
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a step in the right
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
direction thank
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
you are there any
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no questions thank you
 
00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
prol thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
my name is Tom PR from deur and prol I'm
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
here today representing Enterprise
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
Mobility Enterprise Mobility operates
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
Enterprise rentar National Car Rental uh
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
and Alamo rental car brands in the state
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire through a network of
 
00:32:13.629 --> 00:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
over 30 locations and under these Brands
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
they've operated approximately 3,500
 
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
rental cars and trucks in their Fleet
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
over the past 12 months um given that
 
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
the policy has already been adopted I
 
00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to confine my comments to the
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and I think uh represent of
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
Coker touched on quite a bit of what I
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
said but uh I thought it would be a good
 
00:32:33.629 --> 00:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
idea to kind of go through some back of
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
the envelope uh math here and you'll
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
have to bear with me because although my
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
mom was a high school math teacher it's
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
been a minute for me and I just want to
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
make sure I don't do any Injustice to
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
tarnish her reputation but if we uh
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
start with the
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
$270,000 uh fiscal impact as stated in
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note of the bill all right so
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
that loss of Revenue is based on as was
 
00:32:59.789 --> 00:32:59.799 align:start position:0%
stated the contract with Gordon derby um
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
that contract uh is expected or is uh
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
expiring at the end of this year so
 
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
December 2024 with the option to renew
 
00:33:11.629 --> 00:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
um I think it would be uh noted that if
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation passes the house the
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
Senate and receives the governor's
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
signature the department would have the
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to renegotiate a renewal um
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
at which point I think there would be no
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
loss of Revenue to the state um so deter
 
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
to determine how the state would make up
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
the money I thought we would do this
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
math together um and just to make sure I
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
didn't mess anything up so the current
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
cost of the sticker is
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
$3.25 and each year there's
 
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.950 align:start position:0%
$3.25 and each year there's
approximately

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
1.25 uh million inspections at 32 $325
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
which comes to a total of about $4
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
million um now so you subtract from that
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.549 align:start position:0%
 
82,791

00:33:57.549 --> 00:33:57.559 align:start position:0%
82,791
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
we get to about 1 1.1 million uh
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
inspections or $3.8
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
million so that's how we get to the loss
 
00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:11.079 align:start position:0%
of the revenue of that uh
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
$270,000 so how do we make up that price
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
right so we take the
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
$270,000 and divide that into the total
 
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
new number of inspections which is that
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
1.1 million and we would see an increase
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
in the sticker price for an inspection
 
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
of approximately 23 cents
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
making the new sticker cost going from
 
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
$325 to approximately
 
00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
$348 okay so I think that's good math
 
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
right now I'll let you guys check my
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
work but as we look at the cost of the
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
sticker it should be noted that there is
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
nothing in statute to dictate um the
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
cost of an inspection right so those
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
performing the inspections usually eat
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
that cost of the sticker and include and
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
bake that into the total cost of the
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
inspection so as representative Coker
 
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:01.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned we can say the average cost of
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
an inspection I'm assuming you've all
 
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
had your cars inspected I don't think
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
you've ever had it inspected for
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
$3.25 I would say the average inspection
 
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
cost is around $40 so you multiply that
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
$4 times the $82,700 vehicles that are
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
not getting their first their car
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
inspected in the first year and you come
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
up with $3.3 million that would be kept
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
by your constituents and injected back
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
into the economy um so with for those
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
reasons outlined uh Enterprise Mobility
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
supports this legislation and asks that
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
you vote ought to pass um a couple items
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
I did want to touch on that were brought
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
up um mainly through representative uh
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
fellows but first of all this isn't a A
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
New Concept uh so the state of Rhode
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
Island has very similar legislation to
 
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
what's before you today uh new car
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be uh inspected until
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
its second year and also the state of
 
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
Connecticut actually has a four-year
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
exemption for new vehicles
 
00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
at which point you know they're
 
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
inspected annually And in regards to
 
00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
fleet vehicles I know you brought up you
 
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
know fleet vehicles have high mileage so
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
rental cars right the whole point of
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
rental cars is to drive so I've checked
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
with Enterprise and the average number
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
of years per uh number of miles per year
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
on rental vehicles is about
 
00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:22.599 align:start position:0%
25,000 um I will say that uh Enterprise
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
themselves uh they change the tires uh
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
when the tread depth is is at 430
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
seconds of an inch and that tread depth
 
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh is inspected at the return the
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
cleaning and inspection at the start of
 
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
every rental so I think uh you know we
 
00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
should also remember these cars brand
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
new cars are under warranty for two
 
00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:44.839 align:start position:0%
years and I think that this will
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
actually drive more people to to the
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
dealerships to get when something is
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
wrong with their car you know for
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
example I bought a new car last April
 
00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
you know if I hear something going on
 
00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
right now I'm like well I got to bring
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
it in and
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
for an inspection so I'm just going to
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
wait whereas if I had to wait if I was
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
able to wait another year I would say
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay let me bring that in now because
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's under warranty it's covered I want
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
to take care of that um so I think
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
routine maintenance will pick up a lot
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
of the issues when you look at the fail
 
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
rate it's it's minuscule for in the
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
first year I think of about
 
00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
78,000 uh inspections I think only 200
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
failed so
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
again some some math I hope it was right
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
but uh I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
you may have thank you representative
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
elme yes
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
um if you looking at the other side of
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
this the uh inspection
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
stations that also take care of our cars
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
in other ways and this cuts into their
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
revenue and nobody compensates them for
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
that in fact we're talking about taking
 
00:37:57.309 --> 00:37:57.319 align:start position:0%
an extra 25 cents that they're going to
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
covered sure well I think I mean I can't
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
speak for the inspection stations
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
themselves but I think you know most of
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
them also do routine maintenance right
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
so they do yeah but I go in for routine
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance on I went in two weeks after
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh I'd had something fixed to get my new
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
shamberg thank you Mr chairman just a
 
00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
quick question uh are there any
 
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
statistics on how many new cars
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
uh have a vehicle defect that causes a
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
wreck uh I I'm not aware of that not
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
being inspected yeah I'm not aware of
 
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
that I I do have the information
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
relative to our inspections and the
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
fails um and I would say that you know
 
00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
for example model year uh 2022 vehicle
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh in their uh first inspection there
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
were 78,000 inspections uh 264 failed of
 
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
those the majority was for glass which
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh can refer to anything from chipped
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
glass to tinting to malfunctioning
 
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.030 align:start position:0%
glass to tinting to malfunctioning
window

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
window
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
mechanisms can you repeat those
 
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.430 align:start position:0%
mechanisms can you repeat those
representative

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
fellows uh sure uh in uh vehicle model
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
year number two or year
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
2022 uh 7800 ,1 156 vehicles in their
 
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
first inspection uh 264 fails uh of that
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
glass okay follow
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
up so if I hear that correctly more than
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
a third of them failed their first
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
inspection no no no no that, 78,000 yeah
 
00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
compared to oh
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
264 not two I left my cell phone back
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
there but I would need the calculator to
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
do that Ma I I was thinking 264,000
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be a problem that would
 
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
be a problem I don't think we'd be here
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
today if that were the
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
case okay any we're all set thank you
 
00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.109 align:start position:0%
case okay any we're all set thank you
thank

00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.510 align:start position:0%
you the last pink card I have here is uh
John

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
John
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
morasco from the Department of
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:28.510 align:start position:0%
morasco from the Department of
Safety

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
committee my name is John morasco I'm
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
the director of the division of motor
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
vehicles thank you so much for giving me
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak to you this
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
morning um I think the uh previous
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
speakers have already covered most of
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
the content that I would speak to I just
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
would uh go on record on behalf of the
 
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and the DMV uh that
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
we do oppose this bill uh we have
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
expressed that from a safety standpoint
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
um within the transportation committee
 
00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
from a financial standpoint Point um
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
again I think the numbers that were
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
offered here um were right in line uh
 
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
with what I would offer the one thing I
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
do have to offer the committee today
 
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
that's uh a little bit beyond what was
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note is Gordon Darby who
 
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
is the um State Contractor U that
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
provides the software and the equipment
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
to run the inspections um and give the
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
inspection reports um if we look at and
 
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
this is information provided to me by
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
Gordon Darby if we look at 2023 20 24
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
Vehicles sold in calendar year 2023
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a total of
 
00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.630 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a total of
119,120

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
119,120
 
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
um vehicles that if the bill were to
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
pass would not be inspected um that
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
following year that being said what's
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
the grand total on that based on what
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.319 --> 00:41:49.950 align:start position:0%
 
$387,500

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
$387,500
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
which um isn't all that um off from what
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh the sponsor has offered here here as
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
as a figure and um and so as far as the
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
consumer goes um Gordon Derby has also
 
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
explained to me that uh you know their
 
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
business is based on volume um so when
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
they enter into a contract they're
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
expecting um you know a certain
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
projected volume uh a change like this
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
bill would um impact that volume which
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
would lead to um some cost impact to the
 
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
consumer however uh that being said I
 
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
think Tom prol spoke to it um and I
 
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
haven't run that math but uh maybe as
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
low as 25 cents or less
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
um so uh that's that's essentially the
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
um you know the small amount of impact
 
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
you would have to the consumer so I just
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to put that on record and I'm
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative Aly followed by
 
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you can you
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
tell us um maybe you said that I'm sorry
 
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
I was distracted there um can you tell
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
us whether on the sticker price is in
 
00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.150 align:start position:0%
us whether on the sticker price is in
loss

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
loss
 
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.309 align:start position:0%
loss
somewhere

00:42:59.309 --> 00:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
325 I'd have to look into that because
 
00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
we'd want
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
to add that as an amendment if it
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
is let me look into that or think about
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
rate represent Ames
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
um this
 
00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:26.630 align:start position:0%
um this
is

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
well you mentioned that uh I think if I
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
heard correctly I got bad hearing um
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
that uh your office had opposed the bill
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
on policy
 
00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
grounds in the first round is that
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
correct did I get is correct sir that is
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
correct yeah and I know it's beyond the
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
scope of our review but if if if you
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
presented a letter or a statement or
 
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
something like that to that committee I
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
think everyone would benefit from having
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
a copy of that thank you representative
 
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
I'll be I'll be happy to get you a copy
 
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.030 align:start position:0%
I'll be I'll be happy to get you a copy
of

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
that represent to set thank you Mr
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
chairman quick question and I'm
 
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
not excuse me I'm not sure if you can
 
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
answer directly or not how long has
 
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
Gordon Derby had the contract to provide
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
years 20 years 20 years
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
and do you know are there other vendors
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
when this goes out for an RFP are there
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
other vendors that Supply this service
 
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
or is it going to be an
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
issue that's a good question
 
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative I haven't looked into
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
that I haven't looked into that yet um
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
I've been in this position for two years
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
we've been you know obviously using
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
Gordon Derby during that time and while
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
before that um but I can conduct some
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
research on that for you thank you thank
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
you so
 
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
much uh we have representative PL and
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
Lee we had planned to exec this bill
 
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.870 align:start position:0%
Lee we had planned to exec this bill
this

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh right here we had plan to
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
exact this bill this afternoon we're not
 
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
putting any pressure on you for rances
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
in a timely fashion at all
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll I'll get these for you sir I
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
can get them representative Le
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
Lee thank you Mr chair thanks for taking
 
00:45:23.069 --> 00:45:23.079 align:start position:0%
my question I'm sorry if this is
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
redundant but some of the testimony we
 
00:45:28.549 --> 00:45:28.559 align:start position:0%
heard said that there was really no
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
statistical support
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
for uh inspections as far as improving
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
safety when we look around the country
 
00:45:38.589 --> 00:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
is your I I know you said the department
 
00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:42.839 align:start position:0%
was opposed to the legislation um do you
 
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
have any differing statistics or um
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
evidence that the inspections do improve
 
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
outcomes well I have a I have a document
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative that I can provide to the
 
00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
committee that that um has the the
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
breakdown in a a given year of the
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
number of inspection failures and what
 
00:46:03.549 --> 00:46:03.559 align:start position:0%
they're for um you know there are safety
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
items that are in there um so I think
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
the mindset is if you look at it
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
globally um then you would say the small
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
percentage of failures uh even on the
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
safety side um are not enough to prevent
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh a change like this type of
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
legislation but if you take a uh you
 
00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
know family of four or um any family in
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know vehicle on the roadway um if
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
the brakes are faulty um if the steering
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
is faulty uh if the tires aren't where
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
they need to be and especially in New
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
England um one family matters so um we
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
would default to
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
that thank you may I have a followup
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
followup the only other thing I'm
 
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
thinking through as we discuss this is
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
it makes sense it saves families time
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
and money they have a brand new car it
 
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
should be safe um um from the revenue
 
00:46:59.950 --> 00:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
standpoint though as somebody who grew
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
up in a state where we didn't have
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
inspections and then with my first job
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
moved to Missouri where they did my car
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
failed on like 16 points and so I was
 
00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:13.720 align:start position:0%
without a car um so I had to figure out
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
how to buy a new car so at as a working
 
00:47:19.549 --> 00:47:19.559 align:start position:0%
person that was a real hardship for me
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
and so I'm thinking about this as we're
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
saving money for people who just bought
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
brand new cars right so we're saving
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
them a small inspection fee but
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
everybody else still has to bear that
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
cost and maybe even has to pick up some
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
of like even if it's 25 cents to pick up
 
00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
that cost so it feels a little bit like
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're shifting it from people who can
 
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
most afford to pay it to people who can
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
least afford to pay it so that's kind of
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking about as as somebody
 
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
who you know when when you take that car
 
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
in every year sometimes you're like
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
really can't afford a new car I hope
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
this is going to pass inspection so I
 
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
was just wondering if you had a thought
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
or a comment on that yeah I think it's
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
um it's a great Point representative I
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
think it's a very good point from the uh
 
00:48:10.109 --> 00:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
cost standpoint um also i' just like to
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
share that um since the last session you
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
know we we've been working um as best we
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
can you know I could Lieutenant J ly
 
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
from the state police this year along
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
with Ken chaput who oversees the
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
automotive uh equipment inspectors uh as
 
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
part of the state police and I read
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
those reports so they go out and do
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
audits of inspection stations and um
 
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes they do them when uh there's a
 
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
complaint that comes in sometimes they
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
go out and do them because that's just
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
on their list um and when they find
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
violations when they find that people
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
are being taken advantage of through the
 
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
inspection process um they send a report
 
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
to me and I sign off on it and uh the
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
inspection station is set up for a
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
hearing so um so there there's that
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
piece of it the other thing that we
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
worked on collaboratively um
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
particularly for the transportation
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
committee um was people want better
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
messaging um if you don't feel like your
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
vehicle actually failed the inspection
 
00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
or you don't think you were treated
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
fairly how do you deal with that um so
 
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
what we've done is we've actually worked
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
with Gordon derby um and on the vehicle
 
00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
inspection report that everybody gets
 
00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
pass or fail uh We've highlighted uh in
 
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
a better position on that U document who
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
you can call the 800 number um they're
 
00:49:22.109 --> 00:49:22.119 align:start position:0%
going to go through the state police and
 
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
then they'll be uh sent out from there
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
if necessary but um we're trying to do
 
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
everything we can to let consumers know
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
um if you don't agree with the
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
inspection there's a way to challenge it
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
we do take it seriously goes to the
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
state police and the DMV is going to
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
look at it as well and um audits are
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
being done on a regular basis and one
 
00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
other thing I would share with the
 
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
committee is um a large dealership here
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
in in conquer we had the opportunity to
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
tour some months ago and um they're
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
really uh like other inspection stations
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
upping their games and how they uh
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
conduct the inspection so glass that you
 
00:49:55.789 --> 00:49:55.799 align:start position:0%
can look through and actually see the
 
00:49:59.470 --> 00:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
inspection happen um and video that the
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
mechanic doing the inspection goes
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
through and points to everything uh
 
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
within the vehicle to say this is a
 
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
green uh you're good there this is a
 
00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
yellow uh it's not going to fail on that
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
but you need to get that done this is a
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
red this is why it failed and you get a
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
copy of that video so more and more
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
inspection stations are going to um use
 
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
technology and um it allows for better
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
transparency and trust and what we also
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
learned from that one particular
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
inspection station was that consumers
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
that go there that see the video they
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
tend to buy replacement parts from that
 
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
inspection station or dealership because
 
00:50:34.109 --> 00:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
they have formed that trust um
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
so we're working hard to make sure
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
people have an Avenue to uh contest
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
something represent Edwards uh thank you
 
00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I think I heard you say that
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
the department uh opposes the bill on
 
00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.390 align:start position:0%
the department uh opposes the bill on
policy

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
issues I I want to know if I'm it's a
 
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:53.799 align:start position:0%
good assumption then to think that
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the way the bill is
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
was written though uh that gives you
 
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
technical concern that you would modify
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
any of the language it's just if if you
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
oppose the policy I I just want to know
 
00:51:08.789 --> 00:51:08.799 align:start position:0%
if the if the write up of the policy is
 
00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
fair and if you have if you take any
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
issue with the with the write
 
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
up it's a fair question representative I
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
think I think our biggest um issue is
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
the the safety part of it that's really
 
00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:22.799 align:start position:0%
um what we're focused on I think we've
 
00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:24.799 align:start position:0%
you know all all the um the speakers
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
this morning talked about the cost and
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
who shoulders it and uh how much it is
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
or isn't so we we've addressed that um
 
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
the only the only other concern that
 
00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
might be there or or maybe not is from a
 
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement standpoint with regards
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
to uh the stickers themselves but um I
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know that that's a top
 
00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
priority at this point either
 
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
so follow up so so you mentioned safety
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
I think that gets back to the policy
 
00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
issue I'm just trying to make sure that
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the bill as it stands
 
00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:55.720 align:start position:0%
now that you would uh require editing
 
00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
the the document the write up is is
 
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
sound it's just a policy issue that
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
you're having trouble with yes that's
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
fair thank you
 
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
sir okay um anything new representative
 
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
Aly yes uh this isn't quite new but
 
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:13.960 align:start position:0%

representative I I did the same thing
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
when I came into the position I kept
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
hearing the name and I T who who are
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%

Gordon as in G correct g r d n Das uh
 
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
rby r and that's the name of the you're
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
welcome that's a great question I had
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
the same repres Ames did you have a
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
question no okay representative
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
fellows so my my question is um how will
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
state troper
 
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
well right now is there a fine for not
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
having a Val a current um inspection
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
sticker and how will the state troopers
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
and the police know if the um sticker on
 
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
the car that looks like it's a year old
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
is on a car that falls into this
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
2year category or it it could be a car
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
that that's four years old because the
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
models don't change and look that
 
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
different um great questions
 
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
representative on on the first uh yes
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
there is a fine for uh not having the
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspected and I don't have the
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
fine schedule in front of me I think it
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
$62 72 um and then as far as law
 
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement identifying the stickers I
 
00:53:44.349 --> 00:53:44.359 align:start position:0%
actually I would defer to law
 
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement on that um to uh to maybe
 
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
speak to it I don't
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
know speak to that I don't I don't I
 
00:53:53.549 --> 00:53:53.559 align:start position:0%
don't know if we need to speak to that
 
00:53:56.789 --> 00:53:56.799 align:start position:0%
do we what are we talking about the
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
actual amount of the fine no how how
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
they my question the second part of the
 
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
question about how when how will they
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
know if there's not a valid inspection
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
sticker on a car because if there's a
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
stick sticker that looks like it's a
 
00:54:13.829 --> 00:54:13.839 align:start position:0%
year old is it on a car that was just
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
bought last year or is it on a car that
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
was bought three or four years
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
ago how do the cars look how do they
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
know which model year a car is when they
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
see it okay um I guess we'll invite
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.910 align:start position:0%
 
up

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair my name is
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Jay lry from State Police
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
Troop G we oversee uh one of the things
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
we oversee is dealerships and inspection
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
stations in the state and just to keep
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
brief representative U as clerk will you
 
00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:51.799 align:start position:0%
please spell your name sure it's O
 
00:54:51.799 --> 00:54:53.670 align:start position:0%
please spell your name sure it's O
Apostrophe

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
Apostrophe
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
l e a a or y l oh L okay
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
sir so this was something that we spoke
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
about in the procedural process um I
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
guess to answer your question very
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
briefly would be that if this
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
legislature were to pass it would be
 
00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
something that would uh we would have to
 
00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
address an administrative rules because
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
there isn't something already existing
 
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
in that process so that uh we haven't
 
00:55:19.789 --> 00:55:19.799 align:start position:0%
determined should this pass how the
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
vehicle would be um either stickered or
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
have something on it to allow us to know
 
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
when it would be due for an actual
 
00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:31.640 align:start position:0%
inspection oh so thank you followup um
 
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so it would almost be
 
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
like you'd almost you should give them
 
00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
the the sticker for the year that's
 
00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:41.510 align:start position:0%
the the sticker for the year that's
coming

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
up and that would that would actually
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
take care of it but do you know ahead of
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
time and do you have those stickers then
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
everybody would have to have like two
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
sets of an extra set
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
of coming up like a preview I mean at
 
00:55:58.349 --> 00:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
this point we're we're not the policy
 
00:56:01.549 --> 00:56:01.559 align:start position:0%
committee the policy has been has been
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
passed all we're looking at now is the
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
cost to the state so those are those are
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
good questions but I think in in the
 
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
interest of what this committee does
 
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
it's outside of our
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
scope representative PL you may slap me
 
00:56:20.109 --> 00:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
down because this is B is on policy too
 
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
would it help if if this bill would have
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
passed to have a new vehicle sticker put
 
00:56:26.829 --> 00:56:26.839 align:start position:0%
on there so the police aren't chasing
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
well that's you're back to the same sort
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
of question she was
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
asking okay anything
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
you that's all I have for pink cards on
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh HB um 1391 is there anyone else in
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
the audience that would like to speak on
 
00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.870 align:start position:0%
the audience that would like to speak on
HB

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:57:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
1391

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
okay and it appears that it ISS me okay
 
00:57:10.349 --> 00:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
said I'm not an expert on it but I just
 
00:57:12.029 --> 00:57:12.039 align:start position:0%
this is the section that comes after the
 
00:57:15.029 --> 00:57:15.039 align:start position:0%
one that was amended by the okay I can
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
bring it up okay before I actually
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
before I close this
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
um Jennifer for has just brought to my
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
attention that there was the question
 
00:57:26.589 --> 00:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
about is it in law is the fee in law or
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
not and um section 266 colon 2 which
 
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
comes right after this proposed uh law
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
it says the fee for inspection stickers
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
$3.25 for each sticker furnished an
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
approved inspection station the division
 
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
shall transfer 25 cents of each fee
 
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
collected under this section to the
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle air pollution blah blah
 
00:57:52.589 --> 00:57:52.599 align:start position:0%
blah so the important thing is the the
 
00:57:58.589 --> 00:57:58.599 align:start position:0%
$325 is in law section 266 col
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%

Services

00:59:17.029 --> 00:59:17.039 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
unanimously uh I am also I have been a
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patient for the
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
last five years uh just for the record
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh we keep identifying conditions
 
00:59:29.309 --> 00:59:29.319 align:start position:0%
allowed under the New Hampshire
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic program since I first worked
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
as a rep we've tackled insomnia opioid
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
usage and anxiety we keep adding new
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
conditions as they become known and how
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
do they become known we read and we talk
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
to patients they let us know what works
 
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
I started in the therapeutic program
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
five years ago because of chronic pain
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
it was a car versus bike accident when I
 
00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
was a child being in the program I have
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
also used cannabis for insomnia eating
 
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
issues gut issues PTSD and
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
anxiety I found relief from all of these
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
symptoms some of which are not covered
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
in the program I talked to many many
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
people about therapeutic cannabis they
 
01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:19.039 align:start position:0%
want to get in the program they want to
 
01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:22.039 align:start position:0%
see if cannabis helps their condition no
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
one in the therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
uses cannabis to feel high or inebriated
 
01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
I spoke to a caretaker in Maine and she
 
01:00:34.029 --> 01:00:34.039 align:start position:0%
shared with me a wise truth if you're
 
01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
getting high on therapeutic cannabis
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
then you're using it wrong however the
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
biggest concern I hear is will I qualify
 
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:43.799 align:start position:0%
because I don't fit into the current
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
patient model excuse me uh
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas yeah we're
 
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to do the fiscal note so yeah
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I actually thank you because I'm a
 
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
little little confused this has never
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
happened before and and I'm sorry I'm
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
temporarily delegated to well that's
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
fine that's fine so so the other
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee agreed that this was needed if
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
you look at the fiscal note on line it
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
starts on line seven that's the
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
important information yes um the bill
 
01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
may result in a 10% growth
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
increase uh by increasing Revenue up to
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
$70,000 a year if this
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.270 align:start position:0%
$70,000 a year if this
passes

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
passes
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so and there is no expense to the
 
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
state involved in in that according to
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note there is no expense to
 
01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
the state this would only be revenue
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
from increasing patience in the
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
questions well that's very easy thank
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:59.630 align:start position:0%

name is Michael Holt I am the
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
administrator of the therapeutic
 
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis program with the with the
 
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services

01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
support for this bill on behalf of
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
former representative Jerry kerk who is
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
the chair of the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board at a recent
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
meeting uh that
 
01:02:59.710 --> 01:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
board voted to support uh the policy
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
behind the bill and very briefly the
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
bill would add a catchall condition
 
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
allowing providers to certify patients
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
um based on their clinical discretion uh
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
in addition to the list of qualifying
 
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
conditions that are already listed by
 
01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
name in law um we did a fiscal note on
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
the bill um it cannot be estimated how
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
many more people will apply for uh the
 
01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.069 align:start position:0%
many more people will apply for uh the
program

01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
um if we had 10% growth um we might see
 
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue in in the range of
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
$70,000 we have a $50 application fee we
 
01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
currently have 14,000 patients on the
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
program representing 1% of the of the
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire population
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
um the department has sufficient
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
resources to handle any increase in
 
01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:56.039 align:start position:0%
patient load so it wouldn't increase any
 
01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
costs operating costs for um for the
 
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
Department to implement this bill so
 
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
those are the highlights um I'm happy to
 
01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
answer questions about the the estimated
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal note or on the policy of the of
 
01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.349 align:start position:0%
fiscal note or on the policy of the of
the

01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.549 --> 01:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
bill would that application fee be per
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
patient it
 
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
is thank you are there any questions of
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
no then thank you very much thank you
 
01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.029 align:start position:0%
no then thank you very much thank you
very

01:04:30.029 --> 01:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
much is there anybody else who wishes
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
yes uh there is a question
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative elberger thank you um we
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
talking I'm not sure this is a fiscal
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
question so you can tell me it's done uh
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
are there any other kinds of programs
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
for which there is an application fee
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
for for somebody to
 
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
drug not that I know of um there
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis is federally illegal uh it is
 
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
not prescribed in the State uh providers
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
certify a patient has a qualifying
 
01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.589 align:start position:0%
certify a patient has a qualifying
condition

01:05:16.589 --> 01:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
condition
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
um the insurance does not cover it um
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state law specifically
 
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
says that no Insurance shall cover the
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
cost of this um the bill or I'm sorry
 
01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
the law created the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
program as a self-funded program um no
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
general fund dollars go to support the
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
program it is 100% self-funded by
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
patient fees uh and Licensing fees for
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the dispensaries and the
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
cultivation centers um so
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
we the department needs to charge a fee
 
01:05:52.109 --> 01:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
we have the authority to charge a fee um
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
we have not raised our fees since the
 
01:05:57.069 --> 01:05:57.079 align:start position:0%
beginning of the program um we have but
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
we've removed many uh many fees along
 
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
the way ancillary ones that we don't
 
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
need so now that the program is mature
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
um the self funding mechanism is uh is
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
you represent roachford thank you Mr
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
chairman just to kind
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
of add on to my colleague here just
 
01:06:21.069 --> 01:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
curious this so this this change in uh
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
1278 would increase revenues by 7 $2,000
 
01:06:27.069 --> 01:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
a year do we do we know how much money
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
the state is
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
Raising by charging patients to
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
participate in this program the patient
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
part not not the not the grower not the
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
but just the patient
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
part the fee structure is designed to
 
01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
not bring in any Revenue this is a
 
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
revenue neutral uh program it's 100%
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
self-funded um and so we're not
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
collecting any additional revenue for
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
um and nothing's going to the the
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
general fund and perhaps I'm not
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
understanding your question well if I
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
may follow up so the fiscal note says
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
though in DET terminal the department
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
estimates the bill may result in up to a
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
10% growth increasing Revenue by $70,000
 
01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:13.839 align:start position:0%
a year and that's that's by expanding
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
the qualifications in which people could
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
getum it is assume that with when we
 
01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
give providers discretion to certify
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
patients for any diagnosis that is
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
terminal or itting not just the list of
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
20 named conditions in the uh in the
 
01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
current law that we will see an increase
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
in patient registrations sure we don't
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
know how many we we can't know um how
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
many uh people would apply to the
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
program um based on this law uh the the
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
10% projection is is entirely that you
 
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
know we're requ we're required this year
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
um to in addition to saying
 
01:07:52.349 --> 01:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
indeterminable when do we write our
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note worksheets agencies are now
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
required to provide a range of
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
indeterminable and so this is we may
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
have an increase of up to
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
potentially 10% growth and if that
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
happened that would be the number okay
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
great thank you all right thank you
 
01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.269 align:start position:0%
great thank you all right thank you
represent

01:08:11.269 --> 01:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you so if I understand the
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
situation on the 70,000 that we're
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
talking about would come into the
 
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
is to administer the program that's
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
correct and in our budget it's totally
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
you so in theory it's Revenue neutral
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
but could it potentially create
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue I mean the 70,000 is it going to
 
01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
cost that much more to if 70,000 more is
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
coming in is it going to cost 70,000
 
01:08:58.829 --> 01:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
load we don't know how many more people
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
will apply to the program it might be 10
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
people okay we're required to create an
 
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
estimate through in our fiscal note
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
worksheet um and we use a 10% growth
 
01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
number uh if that 70 if if we get
 
01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
$70,000 more money uh uh in an per year
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
we would consider lowering the annual
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
registration fee for patients for
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
instance we could uh begin a program by
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
which we have no fee for certain
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
eligibility categories like Medicaid uh
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
recipients or people who are receiving
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
SSDI so any additional revenues that we
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
would come in that came in if they got
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
to if they were at a level we may be
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
able to have some more policy options
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
for the program to give to to reduce
 
01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
fees to patients okay representative PL
 
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you foring taking my
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
question um we danced around the fees
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
and at one point it wasn't clear that
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
you had fees but uh if you have a
 
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
$70,000 increase based on 10% increase
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
then you do have a fee what is it for
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
registering a patient into this program
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
it's $50 thank
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
you did you have a question represent
 
01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
Aly did you have a
 
01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
okay okay seeing no other questions
 
01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank
 
01:10:32.669 --> 01:10:32.679 align:start position:0%
you I don't have any other pin card so
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
um is there anyone else who' like to
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
testify on HB
 
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
1278 seeing none we'll close the public
 
01:10:43.229 --> 01:10:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
1278 are you going to be exacting
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:11:09.669 align:start position:0%
 
long

01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
gonna no it's uh we are almost we
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
are half an hour behind schedule now we
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
are only 12 minutes behind schedule so
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh the time being uh 11:10 we'll open
 
01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on hb1
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
1429 and I will ask uh representative
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.560 --> 01:12:03.189 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm uh substituting
 
01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
for the prime sponsor um uh uh of the
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
bill I'm the second on the list uh this
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
bill came from conditions in gtown in
 
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester and so there were four
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
representatives from gtown sponsoring
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
this bill but it affects much more than
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
gtown we have in this in um Sunday's
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
Union Leader that now comes out on
 
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
Saturday uh there was a an article about
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
three dams that are being are in danger
 
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
of being shut down uh one and the three
 
01:12:41.629 --> 01:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
dams are Kelly Falls in
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester um the Greg Falls station uh
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
where Glenn Lake is formed and downtown
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
gos down Hadley uh Falls Hadley Falls is
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
probably going to be gone no there's
 
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
probably no way to save it it's it's a
 
01:12:59.070 --> 01:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
hazardous Dam there's no electricity
 
01:13:01.629 --> 01:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
provider there this it's too small to be
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
saved the the Federal Energy Regulatory
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
Commission when I said firk it's not
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
swearing it's Federal Energy Regulatory
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
Commission uh laws uh rules say that
 
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
unless you have electricity producing
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
there uh you uh the dam has to come down
 
01:13:20.189 --> 01:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
and uh if if it requires fish passages
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
of some sort Hadley Falls downtown gos
 
01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
down that's a big economic driver to G
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
down we have our Pumpkin Fest there the
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
the the the races with with the carved
 
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
out pumpkins a lot of people attracted
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
to that it makes the town Town beautiful
 
01:13:39.629 --> 01:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
and if it goes away that unfortunately
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
may change the character of the town uh
 
01:13:45.149 --> 01:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
we tossing around the idea replacing it
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
with some sort of Coffer Dam which is
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
smaller which would still provide that
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
small enough so FK wouldn't consider it
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
a dam uh Greg Falls is were Glenn Lake
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
comes from and a lot of properties
 
01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
around that right on the lake well it
 
01:13:59.229 --> 01:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
won't be lakefront property if that
 
01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
comes down there's a huge impact to that
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
and Kelly Falls in Manchester is forms
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
namas Lake if I'm pronouncing it right
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
which is partly in Manchester mostly in
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
gos down same thing a lot of properties
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
there will uh get destroyed the
 
01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services got
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
a grant in I'll let them see to it to
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
the federal government for a couple
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars to provide a fish pass
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
fish passage at uh at uh Kelly Falls and
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
to truck up above Glenn Lake so that
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
could save those two dams and if if if
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's possible uh then there may be
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
commercial entities to produce
 
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
electricity there but no commercial
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
entity could afford to undertake
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
providing a fish passage and so they'd
 
01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
have to be taken down in the alternative
 
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
because of the risk in that uh this bill
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
was created U and to in a past uh
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
resources and wreck unanimously to uh
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
establish a fund uh a dedicated fund
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
funded by $1 uh and to eventually
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
provide a mechanism for the towns or or
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
interested parties who can a bond to to
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
to uh borrow money from the state to
 
01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
require to do all the maintenance or a
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
construction to keep something in place
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
um and what we could also Bond but this
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
may be another their mechanism to do it
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
and as I say this past so the question
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
before Ways and Means is simply do we
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
create the dedicated fund and put a
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
dollar in it uh and then uh the money
 
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
funding beyond that dollar will have to
 
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
come through the normal budget process
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of enironmental Services
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
I would presume would ask and it's its
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
allocation next year money to be put
 
01:15:49.149 --> 01:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
into that fund it would go through the
 
01:15:51.629 --> 01:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
the uh finance committee of of this body
 
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
and the finance committee of the other
 
01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
body body and eventually go to the
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
governor to fund that that with
 
01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
substantial revenues so there's
 
01:16:00.629 --> 01:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
something there to offset the cost if
 
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
any town were to apply and of course
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
gown would be first in line because
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
we're the first being affected but there
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
were many other towns with Dam's in this
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
situation thank you thank
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
elme thank you the last time this
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
committee had the dam maintenance fund
 
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh which is being circumvented by this
 
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.870 align:start position:0%
uh which is being circumvented by this
uh

01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh on in it on the they had less money
 
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
than they needed to repair the state
 
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
dams that were most in danger of causing
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
damage to places below it I haven't
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
heard whether that has changed but I
 
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
have have over the years seen a great
 
01:16:58.270 --> 01:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
deal of resistance by Governors and by
 
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
by the finance committees to put enough
 
01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
money in there does this um creation of
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
a new fund that would have a slightly
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
different purpose than the other one
 
01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
um have any chance of getting money put
 
01:17:19.229 --> 01:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
in it uh I'm not on finance committee of
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
the house uh I'm I'm in ways and means I
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
I I can't answer the question quite
 
01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
frankly but uh I think with the imminent
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
closure of several of these dams and the
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
impact with the communities might spur
 
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
more support than the
 
01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
did that's the best I can answer the
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund includes things like
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
the whole Connecticut
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
River understood but imminent closure is
 
01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
the alternative it as they say it may
 
01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
spare interest that uh some future
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
problem that might occur may
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:02.669 --> 01:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
rest so if for example in the example
 
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
you give if if this dam was transferred
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
to the town of
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
gtown um the town would be on the hook
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the dam was safe and
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
didn't collapse and and cause problems
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
Downstream yes and it's not a it's not a
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
small undertaking uh it the as I
 
01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
understand I'm not a civil engineer I'm
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
a power engineer U this would require uh
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
embedding into the the rock walls on
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
either side uh because right right now
 
01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
it's in danger of collapsing and the
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
homes below it are danger of loss of
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
life and limb and so it's it's it's a
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
hazard now it does the damage that
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
exists does have to come down the
 
01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
question is whether it's replaced with
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
something smaller the Federal Energy
 
01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission would not consider
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
redam which would provide some of the
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
recreation ability to survive but that
 
01:19:00.189 --> 01:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
would have to be carefully engineered so
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
it is not a hazard to the people
 
01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:04.709 align:start position:0%
it is not a hazard to the people
Downstream

01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
Downstream
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay anybody
 
01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.510 align:start position:0%
okay anybody
else

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:19:12.629 --> 01:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh yes representative
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
fellows so we have we have um some
 
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
testimony from um Environmental Services
 
01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
that's coming
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
out there's pin
 
01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
card never mind we'll ask somebody else
 
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
okay okay seeing no more questions thank
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
PL uh now have a pin card uh for um
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
nhdes

01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee I
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
am uh Corey Clark chief engineer at the
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
dam Bureau at the New Hampshire
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services I'm
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
here today to comment on hb1
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
1429 and as as we've heard today
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
basically this this bill would create a
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism in which when the state of New
 
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a state-owned dam and is
 
01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
looking to remove that Dam there is an
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
option for the municipalities or other
 
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
interest parties to weigh in on whether
 
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
or not they would like to take over
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
ownership of that facility and
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
so but so prior to getting to that one
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
one issue that has come out of um the
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
house resources Recreation development
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
committee and also uh SB 539 which is
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
very similar to this legislation before
 
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
you today is that there are certain
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
state-owned dams that are in the middle
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
of say a state park or a state forest or
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
a fishing game Wildlife Management Area
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
that may not legally be able to be
 
01:20:59.470 --> 01:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
transferred to a municipality or another
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
interested party so currently we are
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
working with the uh Senate to uh clarify
 
01:21:08.669 --> 01:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
that language in SB 539 and so I just
 
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that comment but in
 
01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
working with the the sponsors of this
 
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and the sponsors of the
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
Senate legislation the state of New
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is responsible for the
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
operation and management of 273 dams
 
01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state nhds actually
 
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
operates 208 of those dams so we're
 
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
given the burdensome inventory that we
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
have today we are always looking at
 
01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
different alternatives to either dispose
 
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
of the dams or remove the dams to lower
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
that inventory so we can focus our
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
resources on those structures that
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
really need to be focused on and this
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
this bill would help create that
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism in in when we go to remove
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
these dams to allow other parties to to
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
take over currently what we do do when
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
we are disposing of dams um one example
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
is we are working with a buyer to
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
actually purchase one of our hydrop
 
01:21:58.350 --> 01:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
power sites here in conquer we go
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
through uh the through RSA 440 in that
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
process which go to court long range
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
planning governor and Council in order
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
to dispose of that that piece of
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
properties but there isn't anything for
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
when we remove a dam so this this fills
 
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
that Gap the other thing that this bill
 
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
would create is a loan program I know
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
earlier we talked about the dam
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund and um I'm certainly
 
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
can answer questions on that on that
 
01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
fund but this would create a separate
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
fund that would be appropriated solely
 
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of generating uh loan or
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
a loan program for municipalities to
 
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
apply for or other interested parties
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
that could apply for uh loans to repair
 
01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
their dams now those parties would have
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to to raise local property
 
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
taxes so really those other parties are
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
mainly Village districts or something of
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
that nature and so it would create that
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
program in which um uh municipalities or
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
these other parties could could request
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
a loan that program wouldn't come into
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
fruition until about until 250 I'm sorry
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
$2.5 million is appropriated to that
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
program as we've heard earlier testimony
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
these projects are are quite extensive
 
01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
when we go for full Rehabilitation and
 
01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
so uh that seemed to be a value that
 
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
could kind of get things off the ground
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
but certainly if we are going to be
 
01:23:20.669 --> 01:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
looking at funding multiple loans for
 
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
multiple projects um it's it's likely
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
that that value would not be enough and
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
we'd have to wait until the the money
 
01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:28.360 align:start position:0%
was appropriated enough into that Loan
 
01:23:30.189 --> 01:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
program in order to really get this this
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
thing going but it's it is certainly a
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
start and uh so with that just that's
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
kind of just a broad brush but I wanted
 
01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
to open up to any questions okay
 
01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.790 align:start position:0%
to open up to any questions okay
represent

01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you you did a number of years
 
01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.830 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you you did a number of years
ago

01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
on offer to the city of Lebanon that on
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
we take over a uh small impoundment uh
 
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
relatively small impoundment but that
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
would wash out probably Route 10 if it
 
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
failed which it was in the process of
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
doing on and you offered it to us with
 
01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:12.430 align:start position:0%
doing on and you offered it to us with
no

01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
money and a requirement that we do that
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
we fix it if we if we wanted to keep it
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
and since it is a uh very attract itive
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
recreational draw inside Lebanon among
 
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
the citizens there uh we did it so
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
um how would you
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
decide among all of the projects that
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
that you might get this one wouldn't
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
have wiped out I think any houses it
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
would have been a major transportation
 
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
problem in our region um to to have to
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
rebuild Route 10 right there right next
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
to the dam
 
01:25:02.189 --> 01:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
uh that but
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
um but it wouldn't shouldn't have lost
 
01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
hardly any life if it suddenly collapsed
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
and pushed everything down uh it was an
 
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
old IM uh impoundment for the railroad
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
to to recharge its water supplies as
 
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:23.719 align:start position:0%
they went
 
01:25:28.350 --> 01:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
through so um would it be based on the
 
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
amount of lives that might be lost or
 
01:25:33.149 --> 01:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that might be lost
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
if the dam fails how would you decide
 
01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:37.119 align:start position:0%
among different
 
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
projects if you've only got $5 million
 
01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean we we what we would likely
 
01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
do is uh when the program is established
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
and we have funding in the program we
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
would at that point in time generate
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
rules administrative rules that go along
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
with it and within those rules there
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
would be it would be laid out how those
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
these different projects would be ranked
 
01:26:02.109 --> 01:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
in the criteria to for for these
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities to um be accepted into
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
the Loan program and so that would that
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
would be part of it you're correct
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
likely one one element of that would be
 
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
the hazard classification of the dam so
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
here in state of New Hampshire we have
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
four Hazard classifications we have high
 
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
which is loss of life significant likely
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
not loss of life
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
but likely uh severe economic damage low
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
Hazard minor economic damage and what we
 
01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
call non- Menace which is essentially if
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
that dam was to fail nobody but the
 
01:26:33.790 --> 01:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
owner would know and so depending on
 
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
that's just one one uh criteria that we
 
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
would be looking at when trying to
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
evaluate these certainly as well the uh
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
the impoundment the economic loss if
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
that pound was to go away due to the
 
01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
property around there and and other
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
issues as well associated with those
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:53.030 align:start position:0%
issues as well associated with those
dams

01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
dams
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
Le thank you I understand where the
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
second committee on this bill um so
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps I should have understood this
 
01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
bill before now but I don't so I'm
 
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
hoping you can help me understand
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
listening to my colleague from gtown um
 
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
talk about dams that I live very close
 
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
to um made me think about the dams I
 
01:27:18.109 --> 01:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
live very close to in a new way and um I
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
live right by Kelly Falls so can you
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
help me understand
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
the state owns the dam let's say they
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
own the Kelly fal's Dam um they it's
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
expensive to take care of it and so they
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
want Manchester to take care of it but
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
not give us money to do it I'm confused
 
01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
about what
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
this so I understand this puts into a
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
process this creates a process for the
 
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
transfer of ownership of dams to
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities from the
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
State correct and so in regards to those
 
01:27:58.510 --> 01:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
three structures I'll just briefly
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
discuss those structures and how this
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
would apply to that so within gwn on the
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
bcat quag River downtown gwn as you've
 
01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
heard we have Hadley Falls Dam that is a
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh state owned facility It produced
 
01:28:13.149 --> 01:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
Hydro power up until 2007 because it
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
produced Hydro power it has a Federal
 
01:28:17.629 --> 01:28:17.639 align:start position:0%
Energy Regulatory Commission license and
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
so is it is regulated by FK and it is
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
regulated by FK which is yeah the
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
acronym for Federal Energy Regulatory
 
01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
Commission it is regulated by them and
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
so FK came to the state because it's
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
been so long since we've produced hydr
 
01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
power at that facility and said you the
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire either needs to
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
start hyd restart hydrop power at that
 
01:28:42.669 --> 01:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
facility or move towards surrendering
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
the FK license and in order to surrender
 
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
that license we either needed to bring
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
the dam up to current standards or
 
01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
remove the dam and so when the state
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
weighed their options the the the most
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
likely option was to uh surrender the
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
license and remove the dam because
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
Downstream we
 
01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
own Gregs Falls Dam which is on Glen
 
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
Lake that dam is owned by the state of
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it is leased to a
 
01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
hydropower entity so the state of New
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire actually receives revenue from
 
01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
that lease to that hydropower entity so
 
01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
a portion of their revenue that they
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
make when they um sell their power comes
 
01:29:21.629 --> 01:29:21.639 align:start position:0%
back to the state and goes into the
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
damage maintenance fund that we uh
 
01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier Kelly's Falls Dam is
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
the last one that dam is leased same as
 
01:29:34.109 --> 01:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
Greg's uh to a hydr power entity that
 
01:29:36.189 --> 01:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
hydr power entity was going through
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
their relicensing process every 40 years
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
roughly uh they have to apply for a new
 
01:29:44.350 --> 01:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
license through through FK they were
 
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
going through that process in in the
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
midst of that process learned that in
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
order to get the new license they would
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
be required to put in fish passage at
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
that facility at that point in time that
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
Lei decided it was too costly to do so
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
and decided to surrender the license and
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
pull out of the site and so that leaves
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire trying to
 
01:30:09.109 --> 01:30:09.119 align:start position:0%
figure out what do we do with this
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
location and so the the way this this
 
01:30:15.149 --> 01:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
statute plays into these three dams is
 
01:30:17.109 --> 01:30:17.119 align:start position:0%
essentially that decision we made with
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
Hadley had
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation been enacted we would
 
01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
have then had to go to the town properly
 
01:30:26.830 --> 01:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
given the town the option to take over
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
the site um and then other interested
 
01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
parties and if the town chose to take
 
01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
over this then if we had money in The
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
Loan program they could then apply for
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
the The Loan program to to get funding
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
to repair the
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
dam follow
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
up so my question
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
is so I understand a little bit better
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for walking me through
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
those three
 
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
dams and how they're related to each
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
other I understand that at one point um
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
these were money
 
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
generating um that's no longer the case
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
um they're expensive for the State of
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
maintain so the state of New Hampshire
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
would like to remove the dams to save
 
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire money my
 
01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
question is why is that the
 
01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:20.750 align:start position:0%
question is why is that the
municipality's

01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
problem the municipality doesn't
 
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
currently own the dam correct if New
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire decides to remove the dam it
 
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.719 align:start position:0%
could create water where there's
 
01:31:35.109 --> 01:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
currently not water I understand but
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
aren't you
 
01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
bound to not flood municipalities or are
 
01:31:43.870 --> 01:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
you not well certainly owning owning any
 
01:31:45.629 --> 01:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
Dam there's a certain liability that
 
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
goes along with that should that that
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
structure breach I think in in the
 
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
reason that the municipal alties have an
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
interest in these structures is because
 
01:31:57.229 --> 01:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
of the property and the tax revenue that
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
is generated by these bodies of water so
 
01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
you have Glenn Lake which has I believe
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere on 180 homes you have Nasi
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
Lake no I understand why the
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities have an interest in the
 
01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
damn functioning my question is why do
 
01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
they have a financial responsibility
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
isn't it the state's financial
 
01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility it is as of right now
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's only if it it's only if if the
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wants to remove the if this
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
legislation was enacted if the state of
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire wanted to remove the dam
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
the municipality would then have to
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
weigh their options do we have the
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
financial resources to request a
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
transfer to have the state transfer that
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
Dam to us otherwise do we let the state
 
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
continue moving forward with their plans
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
on removing that structure and let the
 
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
state take care of what they need to
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
take care of it's a mechanism for the
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
the town to essentially interject and
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
decide hold on we want to take over that
 
01:32:50.719 --> 01:32:52.790 align:start position:0%
decide hold on we want to take over that
structure

01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
I I think U um I'm familiar with the
 
01:32:59.950 --> 01:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
gost toown um Dam there and I can see
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
the problem the state will say okay we
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
have a problem we're going to remove
 
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
this Dam and um you know so that we
 
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a breach problem but
 
01:33:11.229 --> 01:33:11.239 align:start position:0%
basically once they do that it's going
 
01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
to look very ugly up there so what I'm
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
trying to understand well that's where
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
the town comes in and says hey no we we
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
want to make sure this looks good so we
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
we'll take responsibility can they ask
 
01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
the question a different way sure in how
 
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
is this not downshifting the cost of
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
running dams to towns in New
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire aren't you just saying we
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
don't have money to pay for this as the
 
01:33:37.109 --> 01:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire how about the
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
towns all pay for
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
it is that what this legislation
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
does if you want to just introduce
 
01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:48.280 align:start position:0%
yourself yes I would I'm rainy peler I'm
 
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
the director of The Water Division at
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
Dees of which the dam buau is part of as
 
01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
far as downshifting this isn't something
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
that we are requiring when we look at
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
the state own dams that Corey just
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
talked about we have
 
01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
273 of them 208 we operate we've done
 
01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
calculations looking at right now if we
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
were to just address all of those DMS we
 
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
have a deficit or a need for around $400
 
01:34:21.629 --> 01:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
million if we deal with a 63 High head
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
the dams that we deal with we're looking
 
01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
at to bring them up to current standards
 
01:34:28.109 --> 01:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
to protect life safety and
 
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure somewhere around 300
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
million so the state isn't looking to
 
01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
downshift these what we're trying to do
 
01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
is be fiscally responsible for what
 
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to maintain so if we have a
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
dam any of the three dams you're talking
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
about in gtown our choice is from a
 
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal perspective of state revenue that
 
01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.189 align:start position:0%
fiscal perspective of state revenue that
the

01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
the proper option would probably be to
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
remove it it's a run-of the river dam
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
it's not needed anymore but over the
 
01:35:03.310 --> 01:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
years because of the benefit of its use
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
and hydr power it created empowerments
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
where we had like cor he said about 170
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
or 180 homes on it so obviously the
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
implication would be if that became a
 
01:35:19.629 --> 01:35:19.639 align:start position:0%
run of the river again with no Dam then
 
01:35:22.109 --> 01:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
in fact the revenue that was generated
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
by the taxes for that waterfront
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
property if you will may be drastically
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
reduced people may go and appeal the the
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
tax rate that they're getting on but we
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
don't look at removing dams just
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly we look at dams because it's
 
01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
more cost effective to remove than to
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
repair for years you know you think
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
about dams like wi basaki and Lakeport
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know you think about the millions
 
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
and millions and millions of dollars
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
that that Lake generates people that
 
01:35:55.229 --> 01:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
live on that empowerment which is very
 
01:35:58.109 --> 01:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
large as you all know don't pay a dime
 
01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
the state repairs that we pay for all of
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
the 273 dams that we own at some point
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
in time we have to be very cognizant and
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
aware of the importance of maintaining
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
and fixing our high Hazard dams that if
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
they fail could actually cause death or
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in infrastructure
 
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of the EMP moment
 
01:36:24.510 --> 01:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
so we're not looking to downshift we're
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
trying to be practical practical about
 
01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
the money we have every year we get
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere around $30 million in the
 
01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
capital budget as you folks probably
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
know certainly better than I probably we
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
usually capped on a Statewide basis to
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere at 120 to 125 million the
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
capital budget it's going to be even
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
tighter this year you've heard me say
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
that we had at least 300 million in high
 
01:36:54.510 --> 01:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
has a damn debt we will again put in a
 
01:36:57.510 --> 01:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
budget for look for $30 million or
 
01:36:59.550 --> 01:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there so we can maintain
 
01:37:03.149 --> 01:37:03.159 align:start position:0%
these high-risk dams and so I get very
 
01:37:05.709 --> 01:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
concerned about when we come before a
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee like this and we're talking
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
about Appropriations and putting money
 
01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
in our budget as you well know when we
 
01:37:14.669 --> 01:37:14.679 align:start position:0%
put a budget together which is going to
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
be Mighty lean again I can see this by
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
any them that we get concerned that when
 
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
you look at the Overview at 30,000 ft on
 
01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
the dees budget in totality that if
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to put in now for another
 
01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
two $2.5 or $3 million for this Loan
 
01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
Fund we have real concerns about that
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative spillsbury
 
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
chairman so uh I also am sort of
 
01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
scratching my head wondering why a
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
municipality would want to take on the
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
liability but I understand that the bill
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
um leaves it up to the municipality to
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
decide whether to initiate the
 
01:38:02.830 --> 01:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
process my question is the bill has four
 
01:38:05.709 --> 01:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
sections it
 
01:38:08.910 --> 01:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
uh in section one it provides that
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
there's a process of onee notice and it
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
calls for rule making in section two it
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
creates or establishes the uh the
 
01:38:18.189 --> 01:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
revolving Loan
 
01:38:21.589 --> 01:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
Fund three just uh makes a reference uh
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
where it's needed elsewhere in
 
01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:27.679 align:start position:0%
law and four makes the appropriation of
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
$1 so am I right in surmising that
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
without the revolving Loan Fund
 
01:38:36.189 --> 01:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
component of this
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
bill we're only left with section one
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
and that would essentially not achieve
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
anything um so why if that's
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
true why would we move the bill forward
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
rather than wait for a budget Year and
 
01:38:56.910 --> 01:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
have it reviewed by the uh finance
 
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
committee in other
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
words I don't see the point of creating
 
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
a fund and putting a dollar into it and
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
then expecting some future legislature
 
01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
to decide whether to put $2.5 million
 
01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
into it and $2.5 million is the
 
01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:15.320 align:start position:0%
threshold below which it's not activated
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
so the whole exercise seems premature
 
01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:18.149 align:start position:0%
so the whole exercise seems premature
and

01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
well I I think so for the first section
 
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of the appropriation the
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
first section would still be but still
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
work re without without um without
 
01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:35.910 align:start position:0%
work re without without um without
Financial

01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
01:39:38.669 --> 01:39:38.679 align:start position:0%
um money put into it so the first
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
section you would still be able to
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
transfer dams throughout the state to
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
you could still work through that whole
 
01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
process of allowing municipalities or
 
01:39:49.589 --> 01:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
other interested parties to take over
 
01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
the second section is you you're correct
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
in in the fact that we would have to
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
wait until the money is appropriated in
 
01:39:59.229 --> 01:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
order to really kick that section off um
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
I think it
 
01:40:02.669 --> 01:40:02.679 align:start position:0%
just I don't want to speak for the the
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the legislation but I think
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
it was a an Avenue to get this this
 
01:40:09.310 --> 01:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
going so that it could provide something
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
for for the municipalities should it get
 
01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
appropriated sometime in the
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
future follow up please follow
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
up so I'm inclined to think
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
that sections 2 three and four should be
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
evaluated in the context of whether
 
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
there's actually a will either in one
 
01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
shot o or over several years to
 
01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:35.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate $2 and A5 million dollar
 
01:40:38.669 --> 01:40:38.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's uh it's essentially
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
irrelevant is there any grounds for
 
01:40:45.589 --> 01:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
passing the bill amended so as to uh
 
01:40:47.470 --> 01:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
retain only section one and drop
 
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
sections 2 3 4 does that achieve
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
anything useful as as far as the
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
Department's concerned as as far as the
 
01:40:54.990 --> 01:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
Department's concerned that would still
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
provide the mechanism for the State of
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to offer these dams if and
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
when we decide we the best course of
 
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
action for the State of New Hampshire is
 
01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
to remove this structure would still
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
provide a mechanism for the
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities or other parties to take
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
structure just as a followup I mean if
 
01:41:18.109 --> 01:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
sections 2 three and four stayed in
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
there um and they weren't funded it
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't hurt anything the town
 
01:41:25.629 --> 01:41:25.639 align:start position:0%
would have or city would have to decide
 
01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
whether they can afford to take it on
 
01:41:29.589 --> 01:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
two sides of the coin it doesn't hurt it
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything well it right except
 
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
that if it does get funded it's good to
 
01:41:36.750 --> 01:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
go it's ready to
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
go representative plus sounds like a
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
good candidate for hp2 when the time
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
comes couple of points first of all uh
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
chairman janigian you said that uh the
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
loss of these dams could result in
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
something that's ugly it's well beyond
 
01:41:55.629 --> 01:41:55.639 align:start position:0%
that the economic impact is
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
huge uh economic impact downtown gos
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
down all all of the all the recreational
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh events going on the the businesses
 
01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
gets attracted to downtown from that all
 
01:42:12.109 --> 01:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
gone and so that and all of the
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
lakefront properties in Two Lakes are
 
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
destroyed essentially the value is
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
destroyed huge economic value and uh I
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
would urge my colleague to
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
push ahead and if it doesn't it does if
 
01:42:26.669 --> 01:42:26.679 align:start position:0%
if if and I believe the imminent closure
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
of Demands might spur Finance committees
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
to do something where they hadn't in the
 
01:42:34.589 --> 01:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
past but the mechanism needs to be there
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative elberger thank you Mr
 
01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
chairman this is a a public hearing
 
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
right we're doing a work session on this
 
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
later correct thank
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:52.149 align:start position:0%
 
Ames

01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
Ames
 
01:42:55.149 --> 01:42:55.159 align:start position:0%
turning to section one and and your
 
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
letter the letter from commissioner
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
Scott that we received um it appears
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
that there are changes are are needed
 
01:43:08.109 --> 01:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of Dees in that
 
01:43:10.669 --> 01:43:10.679 align:start position:0%
section um
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
and um I understand that one of them is
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
that there's language uh that references
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
any state-owned Dam and there's a group
 
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
group of dams that may not be subject to
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
that should not be subject to this
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
procedure that's my understanding and
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
Lang and I guess language is needed for
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
that I'm asking that question also
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
there's the mandate to the
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
department that uh one year prior to
 
01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
removing any Dam the department shall
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
offer to tr transfer ownership and that
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
too as I read the letter um should be
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
limited or there should be exceptions
 
01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
could you speak to that and do you have
 
01:43:55.239 --> 01:43:56.270 align:start position:0%
could you speak to that and do you have
a

01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
specific a specific proposal to make
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
those changes in this bill or does
 
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
anybody sure um so speaking on that as
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
as a you you said in in the letter of
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
testimony it does call out potential
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
issues and as as I mentioned earlier
 
01:44:15.070 --> 01:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
those issues are really kind of centered
 
01:44:17.550 --> 01:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
around these large state-owned Parcels
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
in which you have a dam that's owned by
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
the state that's in the middle of that
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
parcel there's also some possible
 
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
environmental um issues that come up
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
primarily with some of the head of Tide
 
01:44:31.390 --> 01:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
dams that you know the removal might be
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
a greater benefit to the state than than
 
01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
uh transferring it to the
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
municipality like I mentioned there's
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
almost identical legislation in the
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
Senate right now and we are working with
 
01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate to clarify that it just
 
01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
because of the way the the process is
 
01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
playing out um so I am currently working
 
01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
with the Senate to clear clarify some of
 
01:44:56.109 --> 01:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
these issues likely in paragraph two of
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
section one is is likely where we're
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to to add some of that language so
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
that if there's certain circumstances
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
such as I just mentioned a dam in the
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
middle of a large State on parcel those
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
would be exempt from being offered up
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
just like SE paragraph two lays out the
 
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner has as it stands now has
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
the authority if there's a risk to life
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
or danger to to say no we're not doing
 
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
the transfer we're doing the removal
 
01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
this would be something similar like
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
that it would just apply to other things
 
01:45:29.310 --> 01:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
um and just I just want to take a minute
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
to just clarify the um some of the
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
things in gtown so like I mentioned the
 
01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire owns those three
 
01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
structures um we heard testimony earlier
 
01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
about a uh a grant that we are working
 
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
on that is a $20 million Grant the state
 
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is working on and what
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
that Grant would do is we are not
 
01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
interested in removing either Kelly's
 
01:45:55.229 --> 01:45:55.239 align:start position:0%
Falls Dam or Greg's Falls Dam so our our
 
01:45:57.149 --> 01:45:57.159 align:start position:0%
goals and objectives are to keep those
 
01:45:59.709 --> 01:45:59.719 align:start position:0%
structures into perpetuity the reason we
 
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
are going after a $20 million Grant is
 
01:46:05.229 --> 01:46:05.239 align:start position:0%
because that Grant would allow for fish
 
01:46:07.629 --> 01:46:07.639 align:start position:0%
passage construction at the downstream
 
01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
Kelly's uh Dam once that fish passage is
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
implemented we could hopefully get
 
01:46:16.109 --> 01:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
another hydrop power producer to take
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
over that site with a new firk license
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
so that Dam would be generating power as
 
01:46:22.830 --> 01:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
it is today still owned by the state but
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
it would be leased out to that entity as
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
part of that fish passage we would also
 
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
be implementing a truck and trap system
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
that would allow fish to be moved from
 
01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
that location Upstream of Gregs Falls
 
01:46:38.669 --> 01:46:38.679 align:start position:0%
Dam therefore the state of New Hampshire
 
01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't find themselves on the hook
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
down the road of having to put fish
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
passage at that location but it could
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
still remain as a hydrop power site and
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
also remove Hadley Falls Dam and to
 
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
address some of the unsightly issues
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
that sometimes come up as part of these
 
01:46:56.189 --> 01:46:56.199 align:start position:0%
removals is we would be doing a full
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
River restoration program so that would
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
restore the stream channel in that
 
01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
vicinity along with providing public
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
entities such as walkways uh handicap
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
access to the river and other items in
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
that stretch where the impoundment was
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
to help enhance that as part of the
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
whole dam removal process so I just
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify what the state of New
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is looking to do currently uh
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
at on the pasca quog we should hear
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
about that Grant really any day now but
 
01:47:28.750 --> 01:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
that just wanted to clarify some of
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
01:47:33.149 --> 01:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
followup I guess this is a followup I
 
01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
mean that was interesting and useful
 
01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
information but it wasn't I think um the
 
01:47:41.870 --> 01:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
question I was asking was amending
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
amending the bill and you referenced the
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
Senate process that you're engaged in
 
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
with the Senate on a almost
 
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
identical or similar bill um if we're
 
01:47:56.830 --> 01:47:56.840 align:start position:0%
going to handle this thing we we need to
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
make these Corrections and you know I
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
feel positively about this bill but I I
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
don't in order to move it back out of
 
01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:07.719 align:start position:0%
the committee and knowing that there
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
these uh issues I'm not sure how we're
 
01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
going to handle this but I at least we
 
01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
need to get that information uh if you
 
01:48:15.599 --> 01:48:16.830 align:start position:0%
need to get that information uh if you
have

01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:48:21.629 --> 01:48:21.639 align:start position:0%
particular um changes to the Senate bill
 
01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
that we should see we should see them
 
01:48:28.270 --> 01:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
not written out at this time it's it the
 
01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
the the conversation with this the
 
01:48:31.629 --> 01:48:31.639 align:start position:0%
Senate on the Senate Bill took place
 
01:48:33.790 --> 01:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
last Friday and so it's
 
01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
it's we're still working through the
 
01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
language I don't have anything um
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
definitive to to present at this time on
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
this well
 
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.149 align:start position:0%
this well
okay

01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative yeah have to continue on
 
01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:49.189 align:start position:0%
representative yeah have to continue on
that

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:49.199 --> 01:48:51.830 align:start position:0%
that
General

01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
General
 
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
listening to the dialogue
 
01:48:57.870 --> 01:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
here I'm a little bit confused I let's
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
take you have the state-owned property
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
nothing requires you to sell anything in
 
01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.350 align:start position:0%
nothing requires you to sell anything in
this

01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
bill it does offer the ability to offer
 
01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
tax if say the the generating plant the
 
01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
there's a few of them floating around
 
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
the go one and G toown is one that does
 
01:49:28.270 --> 01:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
permit that but it's merely an offer
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
it's not an obligation that you must do
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
you must provide that but you can just
 
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
say hey it's for sale somebody want to
 
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
buy it if you don't want to buy it we're
 
01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
going to blow it
 
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
up is that
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
correct so the way the legislation is
 
01:49:51.149 --> 01:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
proposed it would only apply to
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
situations in which the state of New
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was going to remove the dam so
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
if we decided we are we are going to be
 
01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
removing the dam we must offer it to the
 
01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
municipality first if the municipality
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
refuses then we can offer to other
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
interested parties now those other
 
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
interested parties a pretty narrow um
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
group but we would then have to do that
 
01:50:16.589 --> 01:50:16.599 align:start position:0%
to allow them to take over ownership
 
01:50:18.589 --> 01:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
prior to us moving through the process
 
01:50:20.589 --> 01:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
of removing that Dam
 
01:50:24.109 --> 01:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
so there's no obligation uh on uh
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's no U 28a issue of mandating that
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
the community take it over because they
 
01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
can just say ah blow it up we don't care
 
01:50:38.910 --> 01:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
no uh just follow one one further point
 
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
but if the community doesn't want to
 
01:50:44.189 --> 01:50:44.199 align:start position:0%
take it over an entity that is approved
 
01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
by the community to provide power to the
 
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
town let's just just the current name
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
that's Out There community power for
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
example they could go ahead and purchase
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
it use it to generate uh so-called green
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
uh although it's not really green it's
 
01:51:08.189 --> 01:51:08.199 align:start position:0%
electron well anyway it's yeah they
 
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
power they could purchase it because
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to charge the rate
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
payers and and pay for it and then
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
generate it and all that is that
 
01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.470 align:start position:0%
generate it and all that is that
correct

01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:51:24.189 --> 01:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know if if that
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
would in in that instance if that if the
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
state would then have to transfer it to
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
that entity because that entity does not
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
well you're right they they can generate
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
rates and through the the rate payers
 
01:51:42.589 --> 01:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure if if that would apply
 
01:51:45.629 --> 01:51:45.639 align:start position:0%
however in EV any Dam that we are
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
looking to remove the option is always
 
01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
on the table for any entity to come in
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
and request to take it over it just
 
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
just I mean the way I'm reading this it
 
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
says municipality it doesn't say any
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
entity yeah and well what Mr chair yes
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
what was just U intimated was there was
 
01:52:10.669 --> 01:52:10.679 align:start position:0%
no need for this bill because you can
 
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
already do it look at line 25 on we can
 
01:52:17.069 --> 01:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
already do it we just we're not required
 
01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:26.069 --> 01:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
removal okay representative duet just
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just a quick quick
 
01:52:30.669 --> 01:52:30.679 align:start position:0%
question with the discussion that's
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
going on what is the process for Dees to
 
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
eliminate a
 
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
dam I'm I'm hoping it's a fairly lengthy
 
01:52:42.510 --> 01:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
process if we have 273 dams and Dees
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
decides we're not going to take care of
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
273 dams what is that process and how do
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
you come to that conclusion so so um the
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
when we when we look at the when we look
 
01:52:57.910 --> 01:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
at the inventory we we we look at it to
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know what dams are viable from an
 
01:53:02.189 --> 01:53:02.199 align:start position:0%
economic and ecological standpoint what
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
dams are no longer Meeting those goals
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
they're they're no longer meeting the
 
01:53:09.550 --> 01:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
original intent of those dams and at
 
01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
that point in time that's when the
 
01:53:14.069 --> 01:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
decision is likely
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
made when that Dam in particular needs
 
01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
to be rehabilitated so it doesn't meet
 
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
current criteria
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
we then look at it do are we going to
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
fix this Dam or are we going to remove
 
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
this Dam cuz more than likely it always
 
01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:29.800 align:start position:0%
cost more to fix the dam than it is to
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
remove it and so trying to use those
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
resources wisely and say we can fix two
 
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
out of the three dams we remove one we
 
01:53:42.030 --> 01:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
fix two we fix these three dams on this
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
Watershed but the length of time that it
 
01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:46.679 align:start position:0%
takes to actually get a shovel in the
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
ground from when that decision is made
 
01:53:51.149 --> 01:53:51.159 align:start position:0%
is years and years in the making because
 
01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
not only do we have to make sure that we
 
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
have the proper Revenue to do so but
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
then we also need to go through all the
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
environmental permitting process that
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else would have to do which look
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
takes into account what will the river
 
01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
look like once the dam is removed if the
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
dam is removed is there contaminated
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
sediments that need to be addressed um
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
how how is it going to impact the the
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
Ecology of that river system or that
 
01:54:18.270 --> 01:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
Lake system when this dam is removed so
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
all that needs to play out in the the
 
01:54:22.350 --> 01:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
normal regulatory process through the
 
01:54:24.069 --> 01:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
permitting that takes
 
01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
place follow up quick followup and and
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
that leads to part of my question and
 
01:54:30.910 --> 01:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
you've answered some of
 
01:54:34.149 --> 01:54:34.159 align:start position:0%
it logic would tell me like you just
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
testified to that there are some big
 
01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
costs associated with removing a dam and
 
01:54:44.109 --> 01:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
and as limited as the budget is how does
 
01:54:46.589 --> 01:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
that play into the decision-making
 
01:54:49.709 --> 01:54:49.719 align:start position:0%
Factor let's say you want to get rid of
 
01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
Dam a or Dam B the town doesn't want to
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
take over ownership of that and it's
 
01:54:58.990 --> 01:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
going to cost $18 million to mitigate
 
01:54:59.000 --> 01:54:59.870 align:start position:0%
going to cost $18 million to mitigate
the

01:54:59.870 --> 01:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
situation H how do you go through that
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
and and specifically the decision to to
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh remove that dam is made by Dees by
 
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
whom at Dees is there a board is it the
 
01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner's decision who makes that
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
final decision or who who shares in that
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
decision decision making
 
01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
process that decision-making process
 
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
happens at all all all levels within
 
01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
Dees everything from from the staff
 
01:55:31.149 --> 01:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
within my group all the way up to the
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner of trying to figure out
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
what is the best means of moving forward
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
with this the other the other thing
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
whenever we go to do any Dam
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation or removal is also trying
 
01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:44.719 align:start position:0%
to get the funds to do so and so through
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
the capital appropriation process is
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
when we put forth the projects we are
 
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
going to like we're likely to do whether
 
01:55:53.709 --> 01:55:53.719 align:start position:0%
that's Rehabilitation or removal and so
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
that goes through the process as well
 
01:55:57.790 --> 01:55:57.800 align:start position:0%
the the other thing when it does come to
 
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
Dam removals is there's more money out
 
01:56:03.149 --> 01:56:03.159 align:start position:0%
there federally for Dam removals than
 
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
there is for Dam Rehabilitation we do
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
tap into both Avenues so we we do tap
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
into uh FEMA grants through the high
 
01:56:13.069 --> 01:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
Hazard potential Dam program for Dam
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation projects but then as I
 
01:56:19.069 --> 01:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier we do tap into uh
 
01:56:22.069 --> 01:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
restor projects or restoration funding
 
01:56:23.870 --> 01:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
that can be applied towards dam removal
 
01:56:26.189 --> 01:56:26.199 align:start position:0%
projects so in either way we try to we
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
try to Target our money wisely to uh to
 
01:56:30.669 --> 01:56:30.679 align:start position:0%
get the best
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
outcome representative
 
01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:36.199 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman as
 
01:56:40.270 --> 01:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
finding as fascinating as I'm finding
 
01:56:43.119 --> 01:56:44.390 align:start position:0%
finding as fascinating as I'm finding
the

01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
conversation as far as I understand
 
01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be looking at the
 
01:56:51.149 --> 01:56:51.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal implications for for the state
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
and I would like to try to get the
 
01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
conversation back there thank you
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
represent representative elme did you
 
01:57:00.589 --> 01:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
have a question representative Le was
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:07.629 --> 01:57:07.639 align:start position:0%
leapley thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
trying to help me understand this very
 
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
complex and important issue um it seems
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:21.550 --> 01:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
like investing in this way from our dams
 
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
is a little bit complicated right rivers
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
are long and they're full of water and
 
01:57:30.069 --> 01:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
water goes where water wants to go right
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
um you're an engineer you are fighting
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
quite a battle when it comes to water so
 
01:57:39.709 --> 01:57:39.719 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm wondering like how could one
 
01:57:42.750 --> 01:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
possibly pass this off to municipalities
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
so let's say that like Kelly Street or
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
Kelly Falls is Downstream from I don't
 
01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
know how many dams what if Manchester
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
would like to do something with our dam
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
but you know three municipalities up
 
01:57:57.990 --> 01:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
River decide to do something different
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm wondering how how
 
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities could
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
possibly manage dams isn't this
 
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
rightfully something that the state
 
01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:08.750 align:start position:0%
rightfully something that the state
should

01:58:08.750 --> 01:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:58:12.189 --> 01:58:12.199 align:start position:0%
be dealing with and can you explain to
 
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
me how that would happen yeah I I think
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
the the concept that we're trying to
 
01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
pass us off on Miss ality is is not the
 
01:58:24.069 --> 01:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
issue what we're trying to achieve here
 
01:58:26.189 --> 01:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
is we have a certain amount of money
 
01:58:29.149 --> 01:58:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's available for dams if we get to a
 
01:58:32.189 --> 01:58:32.199 align:start position:0%
dam where it's more cost effective to
 
01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
remove than to rebuild which is the case
 
01:58:37.589 --> 01:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
in hadly Falls that whole Dam would have
 
01:58:40.229 --> 01:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
to be torn down big money and then
 
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
rebuilt it makes no sense fiscally and
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
we we would it would be impossible to
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
justify when we go to get that financed
 
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
through the budget we are not requiring
 
01:58:55.149 --> 01:58:55.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities or passing this down as a
 
01:58:58.990 --> 01:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
28 issue that they have to take over a
 
01:59:01.629 --> 01:59:01.639 align:start position:0%
dam what we are telling them what this
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
bill does it gives us the ability to
 
01:59:09.069 --> 01:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
offer the municipality if they so choose
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
to take over the dam and move forward
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
with the appropriate appropriate
 
01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance so that dam is not an unsafe
 
01:59:20.910 --> 01:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
issue so so there's no requirement that
 
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
the municipality has to take it over but
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
in the big picture for us as you just
 
01:59:29.669 --> 01:59:29.679 align:start position:0%
heard earlier we have all of these dams
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
we have to prioritize which ones should
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
be repaired or what's more cost of
 
01:59:39.310 --> 01:59:39.320 align:start position:0%
effective which one should be removed
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
what this bill does again to reiterate
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
is it affords
 
01:59:47.790 --> 01:59:47.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities the ability to say that
 
01:59:51.069 --> 01:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
dam is very important to us we would
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
like to take it over this bill allows us
 
01:59:57.069 --> 01:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
to transfer that property and with it in
 
01:59:59.910 --> 01:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
sections 2 three and four in the Bill of
 
02:00:03.629 --> 02:00:03.639 align:start position:0%
proposing to offer a loan program which
 
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
may make it available to a municipality
 
02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
like we do with all of our water and
 
02:00:11.790 --> 02:00:11.800 align:start position:0%
wastewater loans we spend millions of
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
loans so to clarify this isn't mandating
 
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
a municipality to take it over it's
 
02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
providing an option I understand that I
 
02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear that what if you
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're are so if the process goes from
 
02:00:32.270 --> 02:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
here to here we're already here I'm I
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
want to back up the process up here and
 
02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
say if we would raise
 
02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:40.270 align:start position:0%
say if we would raise
taxes

02:00:40.270 --> 02:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:00:44.830 --> 02:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to care for the Investments
 
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
our state has made then at the state
 
02:00:51.069 --> 02:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
level then we wouldn't be looking to
 
02:00:53.790 --> 02:00:53.800 align:start position:0%
loan money to the cities to take care of
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
our dams so I'm just thinking that this
 
02:00:58.669 --> 02:00:58.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't really this is kind of
 
02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
inappropriate that this has ended up
 
02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
here so it seems to me that that the
 
02:01:06.350 --> 02:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
revenue does not exist to take care of
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
our dams and therefore we're looking for
 
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:11.639 align:start position:0%
this way to solve the problem so I just
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
want to say out loud what I'm thinking
 
02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.069 align:start position:0%
want to say out loud what I'm thinking
thank

02:01:15.069 --> 02:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:19.629 align:start position:0%
you representative
elme

02:01:19.629 --> 02:01:19.639 align:start position:0%
elme
 
02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that said most of what
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
I was going to say there are poor
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
towns that don't have the money to be
 
02:01:30.270 --> 02:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
able to take something over Enfield was
 
02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
one of them a number of years ago uh and
 
02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
then there are wealthy towns that can
 
02:01:41.310 --> 02:01:41.320 align:start position:0%
somehow do it in order to avoid large
 
02:01:44.910 --> 02:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
mud pits but I was wondering uh in any
 
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
of these cases of REM removal would
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
there be
 
02:01:54.149 --> 02:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
flooding into the low Ling areas around
 
02:01:57.950 --> 02:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
housing so in most cases when when the
 
02:02:05.830 --> 02:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
dam because the dam is there take a any
 
02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
run-of the river dam that dam is already
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
holding back a certain percentage of
 
02:02:13.709 --> 02:02:13.719 align:start position:0%
water and so when there is a flood event
 
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
that flood of bent is compiled on top of
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
the water that is already sitting there
 
02:02:18.719 --> 02:02:19.470 align:start position:0%
the water that is already sitting there
so

02:02:19.470 --> 02:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
so more than likely depending on
 
02:02:23.229 --> 02:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
different circumstances but more than
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
likely when you remove that Dam that
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
impoundment is no longer there the river
 
02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
is still there in its natural water
 
02:02:31.870 --> 02:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
course whatever that may be but that
 
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
flood event is on top of that natural
 
02:02:36.510 --> 02:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
water course so you don't have a
 
02:02:39.069 --> 02:02:39.079 align:start position:0%
compounding event and the other thing
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
you also don't have is you don't have a
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
risk of a breach wave occurring from a
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
damn failure so during the course of the
 
02:02:49.950 --> 02:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
flood you're not you're not in you're
 
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
not putting pressure on a man-made
 
02:02:54.750 --> 02:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
structure that then needs to hold back
 
02:02:57.550 --> 02:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
that flood water and and release it in a
 
02:03:01.270 --> 02:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
manageable fashion so by removing these
 
02:03:04.430 --> 02:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
in most circumstances you're actually uh
 
02:03:06.510 --> 02:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
addressing a potential flood problem and
 
02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:13.950 --> 02:03:13.960 align:start position:0%
issues thank you um I think um we might
 
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
be getting more into policy again um I
 
02:03:19.950 --> 02:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
have a revenue question okay good
 
02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so one of the things you
 
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned is that one of um a dam that
 
02:03:29.550 --> 02:03:29.560 align:start position:0%
had a hydro plant on it is doesn't want
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
to renew because of the fish ladder
 
02:03:34.990 --> 02:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
issue and that you had another of these
 
02:03:37.870 --> 02:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
three that we were talking about had at
 
02:03:39.870 --> 02:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
one time been a power plant but it
 
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't it's not anymore so I'm I know we
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
have existing dams that generate power
 
02:03:49.390 --> 02:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
there like 30 something of them or and
 
02:03:56.430 --> 02:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
are how many of those are going to face
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
issue so when we look at just and excuse
 
02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
me I'm sorry to interrupt the reason I'm
 
02:04:06.149 --> 02:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
asking this is because one of our
 
02:04:09.709 --> 02:04:09.719 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources is a utility tax on
 
02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
these stamps or these power generating
 
02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
facilities well I'll let him answer but
 
02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
my understanding is they have to be
 
02:04:18.549 --> 02:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
operate if they're operating they'll be
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
ATT they they if they're not operating
 
02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
and they haven't operated for a while
 
02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
that's where the issue comes in but I'll
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
let you so and and so I'm thinking how
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
many of the existing ones we have are
 
02:04:32.030 --> 02:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
going to because of this fish ladder
 
02:04:35.069 --> 02:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
issue are going to stop
 
02:04:39.870 --> 02:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
operating so I don't know how many Hydro
 
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
regulated dams there are in the state of
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that are regulated by FK
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire however has
 
02:04:49.470 --> 02:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
11 dams that are regulated by FK nine of
 
02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
those dams are currently producing hydr
 
02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
power and so this would this issue of
 
02:04:59.629 --> 02:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
the state owning a dam that is leas to a
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
hydropower entity and the hydropower
 
02:05:04.069 --> 02:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
entity no longer wants to be involved
 
02:05:06.189 --> 02:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
with that site pertains to nine
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
structures in the state there are
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
certainly many more hydr power dams all
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire
 
02:05:16.669 --> 02:05:16.679 align:start position:0%
but the the state the state owns nine
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
active hydrop power sites and sites that
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
have FK
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
licenses representative PL I'm careful
 
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
not to ask question my question had to
 
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
do with how many of them are facing or
 
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
could are possibly going to have this
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
fish ladder issue that will make them
 
02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
want to shut down it currently the only
 
02:05:42.750 --> 02:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
only one that's that's truly facing that
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
issue that the state owns is is uh
 
02:05:49.109 --> 02:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
Kelly's falls down however as these
 
02:05:50.350 --> 02:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
sites get
 
02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
relicensed um that's when the resource
 
02:05:55.790 --> 02:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
agencies can step up and say look we
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
want to see Fish passage at this
 
02:06:01.149 --> 02:06:01.159 align:start position:0%
location and some of those sites are
 
02:06:03.229 --> 02:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
going through relicensing some of them
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
will have relicensing down the road so I
 
02:06:08.350 --> 02:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
don't know what the answer will be 5 10
 
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
years down the road as to what sites
 
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
will be required to have fish passes
 
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
because a lot of times what happens is
 
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's a compounding effect if you
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
can get fish passage down at LOL and
 
02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:19.270 align:start position:0%
can get fish passage down at LOL and
lawren

02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
lawren
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
and up into Manchester then the fish
 
02:06:23.069 --> 02:06:23.079 align:start position:0%
move up and so a lot of the agreements
 
02:06:25.229 --> 02:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
that the hydr powers have with the
 
02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
resource agencies us fish and wildlife
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
fishing game Noah Fisheries is that once
 
02:06:32.910 --> 02:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
fish are able to
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
move through the the structure
 
02:06:37.709 --> 02:06:37.719 align:start position:0%
Downstream of the structure you own then
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:45.310 --> 02:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
passage represent PL I'm careful not to
 
02:06:47.669 --> 02:06:47.679 align:start position:0%
ask questions because I testified one of
 
02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
the other well you can't ask questions
 
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not you okay okay that's I just a
 
02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
preface that I'm not asking questions
 
02:06:56.350 --> 02:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
I'm making statements well you can't
 
02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
make statements either well course I can
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
I testified so I'm continuing with my
 
02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
test testimony I haven't recognized you
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
there is that correct
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay we can do it in the work you can
 
02:07:15.870 --> 02:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
make statements in the work
 
02:07:19.549 --> 02:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
session okay are we all set on the this
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
topic okay great thank you very much

02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
HB go back now could
 
02:07:35.679 --> 02:07:47.510 align:start position:0%
HB go back now could
should

02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:51.549 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
appearances okay representative PL is
 
02:08:11.069 --> 02:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
yes coming up to testify for a second

time thank you for rec recognizing me
 
02:08:16.350 --> 02:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
and allowing me to speak further uh
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
we've been working uh the cross down
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
representatives and others that the
 
02:08:23.870 --> 02:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
previous committee uh worked quite
 
02:08:27.310 --> 02:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
extensive quite extensively with
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh do we have uh no can we not have
 
02:08:34.430 --> 02:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
discussions in in the uh we have had
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
quite extensive discussions with
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services in
 
02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
shaping this bill also the New Hampshire
 
02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association get their
 
02:08:44.669 --> 02:08:44.679 align:start position:0%
objections handled and we did all of
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm really disappointed to see
 
02:08:48.109 --> 02:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott come out with a
 
02:08:48.119 --> 02:08:49.189 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott come out with a
letter

02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
letter
 
02:08:51.390 --> 02:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
today when he had all this time to
 
02:08:53.310 --> 02:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
address this when it was in the previous
 
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee um and I just want to say that
 
02:08:58.430 --> 02:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
that this isn't the first time I've had
 
02:08:59.950 --> 02:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott come up with
 
02:09:01.629 --> 02:09:01.639 align:start position:0%
something at the last minute which could
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
have addressed it much sooner um I would
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
say I want this bill passed if the
 
02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
Senate's working on a different version
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
come to either Committee of conference
 
02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
or something uh to work it out uh or we
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
adopt the Senate's version at the end
 
02:09:18.910 --> 02:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
but I want to move this forward uh and
 
02:09:21.310 --> 02:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh let's uh representative PL let's keep
 
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
the comments to the specifics in the
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill I I understand your passion on this
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
I think you can bring that up in the
 
02:09:28.830 --> 02:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
work session thank you I just want to
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
State my displeasure with commissioner
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
Scott not coming up with this a month
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
ago thank
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
you um okay I'm going to close the
 
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB

the record my name is Dan Maguire I
 
02:10:06.549 --> 02:10:06.559 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Epsom I was the
 
02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
chair of the joint committee on
 
02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds which uh you were a
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
member and your ranking member was our
 
02:10:16.830 --> 02:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
clerk the most useful member of the
 
02:10:21.709 --> 02:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
committee by far are and um so that this
 
02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
was in September and October we we uh
 
02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
this committee examines all dedicated
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
funds and reviews them on a fiveyear
 
02:10:34.549 --> 02:10:34.559 align:start position:0%
cycle so this particular year uh we
 
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
reviewed funds from the agriculture
 
02:10:39.069 --> 02:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
Department the department of
 
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
administrative Services insurance
 
02:10:44.350 --> 02:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
department and so on several others and
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
um this bill in front of you is the
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
result and most of this is very very
 
02:10:53.069 --> 02:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
minor this is not Millions this is at
 
02:10:55.629 --> 02:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
most thousands in in some cases much
 
02:10:58.109 --> 02:10:58.119 align:start position:0%
less so
 
02:11:01.589 --> 02:11:01.599 align:start position:0%
um I can you know go through it it's
 
02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
it's mostly little tiny cleanup things
 
02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
funds that have had no revenue or
 
02:11:09.629 --> 02:11:09.639 align:start position:0%
expenses for years and and we're getting
 
02:11:12.229 --> 02:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
rid of them or in some cases combining
 
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
them with other funds that are uh that
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
are used for these very minor things but
 
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
um this is sort of on the edge of of
 
02:11:24.030 --> 02:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
technical corrections I guess the most
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
interesting part is this dog license fee
 
02:11:29.229 --> 02:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
thing and that's why this bill comes to
 
02:11:30.990 --> 02:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
you not as a first committee but as a
 
02:11:33.189 --> 02:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
second committee so it already went
 
02:11:35.629 --> 02:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
through environment and agriculture
 
02:11:37.950 --> 02:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
specifically for the dog license part of
 
02:11:40.510 --> 02:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
it so I'm happy to answer questions
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards uh
 
02:11:44.430 --> 02:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:11:46.990 --> 02:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire for taking my uh
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:11:52.589 --> 02:11:52.599 align:start position:0%
I fir first a little background I I I
 
02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
want to say that um when you're doing it
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh modifications software updates uh it
 
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
takes a period of time for an analyst to
 
02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
take a look at the software uh plan what
 
02:12:10.030 --> 02:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to code check with people
 
02:12:11.629 --> 02:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
about what they're going to code then
 
02:12:14.549 --> 02:12:14.559 align:start position:0%
they code then after it's coded it goes
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
to quality assurance and then it gets
 
02:12:19.229 --> 02:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
tested before it goes live and then
 
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's a go live and so the
 
02:12:24.830 --> 02:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
administrative managerial overhead of a
 
02:12:28.589 --> 02:12:28.599 align:start position:0%
software update is actually fairly
 
02:12:31.270 --> 02:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
significant and so my question is as I
 
02:12:34.270 --> 02:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
look at the the pennies involved here
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
and your comment that this may be
 
02:12:40.350 --> 02:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
influences a few thousand doll it it my
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
instinct on this is that um while it may
 
02:12:47.470 --> 02:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
make it more precise it's not worth the
 
02:12:50.589 --> 02:12:50.599 align:start position:0%
investment it just doesn't Reach the the
 
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
the the cost benefit stage and this is
 
02:12:56.669 --> 02:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
particularly important because our it
 
02:13:00.189 --> 02:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
department is is overloaded with it
 
02:13:01.950 --> 02:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
projects that they're working on and so
 
02:13:04.189 --> 02:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
finding the analyst time and all is is
 
02:13:06.750 --> 02:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
sort of a challenge anyways so so my
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
question sir is um in in your managerial
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
Instinct does this pass the common sense
 
02:13:18.030 --> 02:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
test is this is this worth chasing a few
 
02:13:20.589 --> 02:13:20.599 align:start position:0%
pennies at the cost of of all of that
 
02:13:23.470 --> 02:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
analyst time um well thank you for the
 
02:13:25.069 --> 02:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
question but I I guess I must have given
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
the wrong impression because this is not
 
02:13:30.669 --> 02:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
about it this is about dedicated
 
02:13:35.069 --> 02:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
so can you can you explain but all of
 
02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
these funds are supported by some it
 
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere that that there that there's
 
02:13:46.030 --> 02:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who's collecting this money and
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
and it and it can't and it's got to be
 
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
automated to some extent does it not or
 
02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
am I just completely missing this if I
 
02:13:56.109 --> 02:13:56.119 align:start position:0%
am I I yeah I I don't think so I mean I
 
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
think there's um so first of all these
 
02:14:04.229 --> 02:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
are like bank accounts right and so
 
02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
having an extra one or not an extra
 
02:14:09.629 --> 02:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
one is maybe makes a little bit of a
 
02:14:12.830 --> 02:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
change to the way the comproller does
 
02:14:15.629 --> 02:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
her job right but it's it's like having
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
another bank account or not it's it's
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
not not um there's not a lot of
 
02:14:24.149 --> 02:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
programming or something like that
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
involved so no I I think the answer is
 
02:14:30.430 --> 02:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
basically no I I don't think this is not
 
02:14:33.229 --> 02:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
a huge thing to to eliminate one or add
 
02:14:36.270 --> 02:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
one or so on and especially because they
 
02:14:38.149 --> 02:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
exist right there there there's sort of
 
02:14:42.549 --> 02:14:42.559 align:start position:0%
an ongoing bank account there and and it
 
02:14:44.669 --> 02:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
has static money in it for example in
 
02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
many of these cases right so it has $300
 
02:14:50.589 --> 02:14:50.599 align:start position:0%
or it has $1,000 or it has something and
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
so we're just deciding let's get rid of
 
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
this so we don't have to think about it
 
02:14:58.390 --> 02:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
anymore and and move on right
 
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
so so no I I mean I was a software
 
02:15:03.390 --> 02:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
manager so I I appreciate all the you
 
02:15:05.709 --> 02:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
know what you just said but it's it's
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
really not that I don't think
 
02:15:11.149 --> 02:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
representative PL yes I see this drops
 
02:15:15.229 --> 02:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
the fee for license for dog from $2 to
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
$1.75 and it increases the amount that
 
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
the clerk send to the Department of
 
02:15:22.990 --> 02:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets from0 50 cents to 75
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
cents so the differences coming out of
 
02:15:27.669 --> 02:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
the Town municipality pocket they won't
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
be too pleased about that what what's
 
02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
the justification thank thank you for
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
the question but no that's not so so
 
02:15:35.910 --> 02:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
currently um
 
02:15:40.990 --> 02:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
$2.50 from the dog license fee goes to
 
02:15:44.750 --> 02:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
two State programs there's a split right
 
02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
currently $2 goes to one particular
 
02:15:49.229 --> 02:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
State program and 50 cents goes to the
 
02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
other state program this bill simply re
 
02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
jiggers the split so that $1.75 goes to
 
02:15:59.189 --> 02:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
one state program and and 75 cents goes
 
02:16:01.350 --> 02:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
to the other state program and that's
 
02:16:05.350 --> 02:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
because um uh the one was running a
 
02:16:08.069 --> 02:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
little short of funds that's the veter V
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Diagnostics laboratory it's a
 
02:16:13.990 --> 02:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
lab that that does mostly rabies tests
 
02:16:16.549 --> 02:16:16.559 align:start position:0%
but other kinds of tests I think too and
 
02:16:18.430 --> 02:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
the and the other one was the spay and
 
02:16:20.430 --> 02:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
neuter program which was having an
 
02:16:22.990 --> 02:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
excess of funds so this actually doesn't
 
02:16:26.149 --> 02:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
change what happens in in Towns at
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
all thank
 
02:16:31.709 --> 02:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
you represent Aly you're on the bill did
 
02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
you want to make any
 
02:16:38.910 --> 02:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
statements I just wanted to say that the
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was not sent to
 
02:16:46.629 --> 02:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
it on that we have had fiscal notes that
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
did talk about the cost of on
 
02:16:56.709 --> 02:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
re uh REM managing the deck chairs and
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
um the laboratory fund is
 
02:17:06.509 --> 02:17:06.519 align:start position:0%
important on
 
02:17:09.150 --> 02:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
for on
 
02:17:11.230 --> 02:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
finding on
 
02:17:15.790 --> 02:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:18.750 --> 02:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
population so the fact that it's been
 
02:17:20.910 --> 02:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
short changed and that the other one was
 
02:17:25.230 --> 02:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
swimming in money is a was a problem
 
02:17:27.629 --> 02:17:27.639 align:start position:0%
yeah okay maybe I should have been up
 
02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
there to say
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman I want to that was a
 
02:17:34.110 --> 02:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
would you believe question since you're
 
02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
not there thank you U so let me just add
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
one other thing besides the bill the the
 
02:17:44.669 --> 02:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
the process of of looking through all
 
02:17:47.150 --> 02:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
these funds was quite worthwhile in the
 
02:17:50.190 --> 02:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
sense that that um we we came up with
 
02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
some ideas for future
 
02:17:55.469 --> 02:17:55.479 align:start position:0%
legislation that that was not simple
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
cleanup like this for example um we
 
02:18:01.629 --> 02:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
discovered that the what we're charging
 
02:18:04.349 --> 02:18:04.359 align:start position:0%
justices of the peace is about three
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
times more than needed so so your
 
02:18:09.990 --> 02:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Peace licenses laps a
 
02:18:11.870 --> 02:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
bunch of money to the general fund every
 
02:18:13.990 --> 02:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
year and that's not really appropriate
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
we generally with licensing we like to
 
02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
match expenses and and revenue and so
 
02:18:22.509 --> 02:18:22.519 align:start position:0%
you know for a future bill that gives us
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
the idea maybe we should lower the fee
 
02:18:26.429 --> 02:18:26.439 align:start position:0%
for a Justice of the Peace things like
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
that so there were some other things of
 
02:18:30.230 --> 02:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
that nature that were found by the
 
02:18:32.669 --> 02:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
committee but don't exist yet in in
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
legislation right thank you okay um I
 
02:18:39.950 --> 02:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
think U represent
 
02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
fellows so I I have a um something of
 
02:18:46.309 --> 02:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
the whole section of the statute you
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
know not just the amended part and and
 
02:18:49.910 --> 02:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
the part that you can't see if you're
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill is that the basic
 
02:18:57.469 --> 02:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:57.479 --> 02:18:59.589 align:start position:0%
 
450

02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
450
 
02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
and the the other thing is when you get
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
down to line 9 it says in my which is
 
02:19:09.309 --> 02:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
the category I fall into and when I go
 
02:19:12.270 --> 02:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
to get a dog license I pay in cash and I
 
02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:13.309 align:start position:0%
to get a dog license I pay in cash and I
bring

02:19:13.309 --> 02:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
bring
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
$2 and I just think for these tiny
 
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
amounts I just don't
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
see the value of of making those changes
 
02:19:26.669 --> 02:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
and I and I really think that you know
 
02:19:29.150 --> 02:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
making like one do rounding everything
 
02:19:31.870 --> 02:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
off to$ one dollar would to full dollar
 
02:19:35.309 --> 02:19:35.319 align:start position:0%
would be a better idea just yes thank
 
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative yes
 
02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
as I understand it the fee for a dog
 
02:19:44.070 --> 02:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
is450 if the dog is neutered and $7 if
 
02:19:47.429 --> 02:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
it's not um and and there's some break
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
break for for owners who are 65 or older
 
02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
but um but it looks like pennies here
 
02:19:59.230 --> 02:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
but it turns into thousands right the
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
the the diagnostic
 
02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
laboratory uh is over $100,000 a year is
 
02:20:08.429 --> 02:20:08.439 align:start position:0%
that expense and the spay and neuter
 
02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
program is much more so so it's you know
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of dogs and cats out there
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
and so the these little dollar amounts
 
02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
do turn into into something more
 
02:20:20.510 --> 02:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
significant I mean there's actual
 
02:20:23.230 --> 02:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
employees who are you know hired by
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
those funds yeah the go the goal here as
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
as the representative had said earlier
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
was to balance the funds out we are
 
02:20:33.150 --> 02:20:33.160 align:start position:0%
finding that there was a large imbalance
 
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
in these funds and that's why these
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
numbers while if you just look at the
 
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
number by itself it looks silly but it
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
actually does add up to to to thousands
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
I mean during the committee I personally
 
02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
suggested that we put the $2.50 sense in
 
02:20:50.670 --> 02:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
one of the funds eliminate the other one
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
and pay both expenses out of that fund
 
02:20:55.070 --> 02:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
so therefore we'd never have to think
 
02:20:57.150 --> 02:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
about this again but the rest of the
 
02:20:58.750 --> 02:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
committee didn't well and I think the
 
02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
department didn't like that idea because
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
because the two uses of the fund are
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
very separate as far as the department
 
02:21:08.590 --> 02:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
goes so they like the fact that there's
 
02:21:11.469 --> 02:21:11.479 align:start position:0%
two funds and that's why we're here
 
02:21:13.950 --> 02:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
today thank you I have a copy of our
 
02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
report um I'll give to your clerk if
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to sounds it all right and
 
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
we'll talk more about this this
 
02:21:23.630 --> 02:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon um I'd like to I'd like to
 
02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
wrap up this public hearing unless there
 
02:21:27.710 --> 02:21:27.720 align:start position:0%

02:21:29.710 --> 02:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you okay seeing none
 
02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:30.790 align:start position:0%
question thank you okay seeing none

02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
sessions on these five bills um and so
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
the time being um 12:22 and I'm assuming
 
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
people might want to have some lunch uh
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
why don't we come back and start the
 
02:22:06.389 --> 02:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
work session at
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
1:10 we'll come back at 1:10 and start
 
02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
sessions okay any questions before we go
 
02:22:20.270 --> 02:22:20.280 align:start position:0%

uh we will have an exec session we're
 
02:22:24.670 --> 02:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
have a work session on the five bills
 
02:22:26.670 --> 02:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
and then I set 1:30 obviously it's going
 
02:22:28.670 --> 02:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
to be a little later than 1:30 but
 
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
whatever bills of those five we feel
 
02:22:32.190 --> 02:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
like we can exec I would like to get
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
them out of the committee if possible if
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's not possible we will schedule
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
another time for whatever bill that is
 
02:22:40.830 --> 02:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
um yes Mr chairman I take just a moment
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%

02:22:57.670 --> 02:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and I wanted to let

03:20:37.910 --> 03:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
committee work sessions we're going to
 
03:20:41.189 --> 03:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
start with uh HB 1179 so I'll open that
 
03:20:45.309 --> 03:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:48.750 --> 03:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
now do I have comments questions
 
03:20:51.150 --> 03:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
representative PL this has minimal
 
03:20:53.950 --> 03:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue impact and it's a good thing to
 
03:20:56.150 --> 03:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
do I see no problem with passing this
 
03:21:00.269 --> 03:21:00.279 align:start position:0%
bill personally thank you Rosen
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
elme I just wanted to know if there's
 
03:21:06.950 --> 03:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
anybody yet from the uh Park
 
03:21:09.389 --> 03:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
service is anyone from the park service
 
03:21:13.429 --> 03:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
here doesn't look like it I would say no
 
03:21:16.389 --> 03:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
um and it it sounds like uh based on our
 
03:21:19.790 --> 03:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing it sounds like the
 
03:21:23.349 --> 03:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh we're looking at a revenue hit of
 
03:21:30.110 --> 03:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
potentially uh five 5K roughly 55 5500
 
03:21:33.429 --> 03:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
okay um so it's it is fairly minimal yes
 
03:21:35.469 --> 03:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
representative selfworth yes I could
 
03:21:37.750 --> 03:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
support it I would like though the
 
03:21:39.550 --> 03:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
department to verify that because I feel
 
03:21:40.670 --> 03:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
like we should have gotten something
 
03:21:42.990 --> 03:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
from them
 
03:21:44.910 --> 03:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
you know that that number isn't in their
 
03:21:47.110 --> 03:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
report it's in someone else's and I
 
03:21:49.110 --> 03:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
would like their you know I'd like them
 
03:21:51.670 --> 03:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
to just verify that but I'm willing to
 
03:21:55.110 --> 03:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
support the bill okay can we
 
03:21:58.269 --> 03:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not saying to wait wait now
 
03:21:59.590 --> 03:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying I think they really
 
03:22:03.710 --> 03:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
should verify it yeah okay represent
 
03:22:08.030 --> 03:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
Aly yes I'm willing to vote for it with
 
03:22:10.990 --> 03:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
the understanding that it goes to the
 
03:22:14.110 --> 03:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
Senate next and that
 
03:22:18.630 --> 03:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
on the Park service will show up if it
 
03:22:21.870 --> 03:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
is as much as they claimed okay because
 
03:22:23.229 --> 03:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
that's a significant amount of
 
03:22:29.910 --> 03:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:34.229 --> 03:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
you anybody else comments
 
03:22:37.469 --> 03:22:37.479 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none I'm going to
 
03:22:40.750 --> 03:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
close the work session on HB
 
03:22:40.760 --> 03:22:44.990 align:start position:0%
close the work session on HB
1179

03:22:44.990 --> 03:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'll now open the work session on HB
 
03:22:50.349 --> 03:22:50.359 align:start position:0%
1391 allowing new vehicles purchased in
 
03:22:51.830 --> 03:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
the model year or
 
03:22:54.070 --> 03:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
before to be inspected in the second
 
03:22:58.189 --> 03:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:01.429 --> 03:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
purchase representative plat does this
 
03:23:03.429 --> 03:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
need an amendment before we can pass it
 
03:23:07.429 --> 03:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
because the fee is in law and so we have
 
03:23:10.429 --> 03:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
to do something about that uh uh at
 
03:23:12.510 --> 03:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
least say that uh
 
03:23:14.189 --> 03:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
a reminder that the law needs to be
 
03:23:17.110 --> 03:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
Revisited if this passed to change to
 
03:23:20.349 --> 03:23:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:23.309 --> 03:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
amount and the the amount you would
 
03:23:25.830 --> 03:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
wanted um representative spillsbury do
 
03:23:27.950 --> 03:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
03:23:30.150 --> 03:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
comment no I'm
 
03:23:34.229 --> 03:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
confused we're we're talking about uh
 
03:23:35.910 --> 03:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
the exemption from
 
03:23:39.389 --> 03:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
inspections what has to change in
 
03:23:43.469 --> 03:23:43.479 align:start position:0%
amount so when they talked about uh 25
 
03:23:46.030 --> 03:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
cent uh you know roughly if it was if
 
03:23:47.870 --> 03:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
the fee was increased 25 cents that
 
03:23:49.349 --> 03:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
would make up for the
 
03:23:52.830 --> 03:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
shortfall um that fee the current fee of
 
03:23:57.870 --> 03:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
$325 is in the statute in RSA 2 266
 
03:23:57.880 --> 03:23:59.950 align:start position:0%
$325 is in the statute in RSA 2 266
colon

03:23:59.950 --> 03:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
colon
 
03:24:03.070 --> 03:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
2 so if that if that does need to be
 
03:24:07.510 --> 03:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
increased by 25 cents then um we would
 
03:24:11.710 --> 03:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
have to uh make a change to 262 colon 2
 
03:24:13.389 --> 03:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
question I think that was the yeah
 
03:24:14.830 --> 03:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
represented Southworth I mean it would
 
03:24:16.309 --> 03:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
just seem if this passes that they
 
03:24:18.910 --> 03:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
cannot increase it by 25 cents they just
 
03:24:22.510 --> 03:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
have to keep it the way it is right
 
03:24:25.070 --> 03:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
unless and until the law is changed
 
03:24:29.150 --> 03:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
right so it I guess in some way or at
 
03:24:31.030 --> 03:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
some level it doesn't stop us from from
 
03:24:32.550 --> 03:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
moving forward but there'd have to be
 
03:24:34.870 --> 03:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
the recognition that that shortfall
 
03:24:40.550 --> 03:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:40.560 --> 03:24:42.910 align:start position:0%
 
2

03:24:42.910 --> 03:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
2
 
03:24:46.389 --> 03:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:51.189 --> 03:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
Ames I'd like to uh hold the
 
03:24:55.229 --> 03:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
bill um to give time for us to receive
 
03:24:58.309 --> 03:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
to receive the uh what was it
 
03:24:58.319 --> 03:24:59.670 align:start position:0%
to receive the uh what was it
commissioner

03:24:59.670 --> 03:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:25:04.110 --> 03:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
Scott's um written testimony to the
 
03:25:04.120 --> 03:25:05.070 align:start position:0%
Scott's um written testimony to the
first

03:25:05.070 --> 03:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:25:08.429 --> 03:25:08.439 align:start position:0%
committee um to be sure
 
03:25:08.439 --> 03:25:10.469 align:start position:0%
committee um to be sure
to

03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:25:14.429 --> 03:25:14.439 align:start position:0%
satisfy the question of whether there
 
03:25:17.630 --> 03:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
are there's some part of that opposition
 
03:25:22.469 --> 03:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
that translates to cost uh and um should
 
03:25:25.429 --> 03:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
be of concern to ours us we've really
 
03:25:27.950 --> 03:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
received very little
 
03:25:30.870 --> 03:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
information um other than the knowledge
 
03:25:33.750 --> 03:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
that the the public safy safety
 
03:25:36.429 --> 03:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
department opposes this bill and I'd
 
03:25:39.750 --> 03:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
like to have a full understanding of
 
03:25:42.630 --> 03:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
that before uh uh going forward with
 
03:25:45.070 --> 03:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
this bill as is or maybe determining
 
03:25:48.710 --> 03:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
there some aspect of it that uh uh that
 
03:25:52.189 --> 03:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
does impact on um the
 
03:25:54.550 --> 03:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
particular Focus that we have as a
 
03:25:54.560 --> 03:25:56.870 align:start position:0%
particular Focus that we have as a
second

03:25:56.870 --> 03:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:25:56.880 --> 03:25:59.670 align:start position:0%
second
committee

03:25:59.670 --> 03:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:26:03.030 --> 03:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
represent is representative Scott uh not
 
03:26:05.269 --> 03:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative Scott
 
03:26:10.070 --> 03:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
um Commissioner of of um safety I don't
 
03:26:12.790 --> 03:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
believe he's Scott Dees Commissioner of
 
03:26:12.800 --> 03:26:14.590 align:start position:0%
believe he's Scott Dees Commissioner of
sty

03:26:14.590 --> 03:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
sty
 
03:26:14.600 --> 03:26:16.630 align:start position:0%
sty
oh

03:26:16.630 --> 03:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:26:20.269 --> 03:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
okay um right yes was in PL I understood
 
03:26:22.670 --> 03:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
the opposition was just that any
 
03:26:25.710 --> 03:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
reduction inspections has a safety issue
 
03:26:27.950 --> 03:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
attached and the question for this
 
03:26:29.429 --> 03:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
committee is it serious enough to do
 
03:26:32.189 --> 03:26:32.199 align:start position:0%
anything about uh or to oppose the bill
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
but that's all if it was any reduction
 
03:26:35.950 --> 03:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
whatsoever they'd be
 
03:26:39.070 --> 03:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
opposed I I think he he if I remember
 
03:26:41.189 --> 03:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
correctly he did say that if you looked
 
03:26:44.269 --> 03:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
at just the numbers you would see that
 
03:26:46.550 --> 03:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
there were very few numbers but I think
 
03:26:48.429 --> 03:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
didn't he make the point of if you had a
 
03:26:50.429 --> 03:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
family of four and a car and it was was
 
03:26:52.389 --> 03:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
something wrong with it then that's for
 
03:26:54.990 --> 03:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
people who could be injured um so I
 
03:26:56.750 --> 03:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
think to your point representative PL
 
03:26:59.110 --> 03:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
yes I think he was saying any any
 
03:27:00.950 --> 03:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
reduction in inspections could
 
03:27:03.830 --> 03:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
potentially be a safety issue so it's
 
03:27:06.110 --> 03:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's we have to figure out uh as a
 
03:27:09.389 --> 03:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
committee I guess where that balance
 
03:27:12.030 --> 03:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
might be although yeah representative
 
03:27:14.309 --> 03:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I think my point is this is
 
03:27:16.110 --> 03:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
this is a significant
 
03:27:19.670 --> 03:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
change um it is I mean whether you like
 
03:27:23.349 --> 03:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
it or don't like it it's saying no
 
03:27:26.269 --> 03:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
inspections for new cars to find in the
 
03:27:29.150 --> 03:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
statute for two years and that's a
 
03:27:31.269 --> 03:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
significant difference from the
 
03:27:34.630 --> 03:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
situation today let's be sure uh that
 
03:27:36.189 --> 03:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
we're doing this right let's take a
 
03:27:38.349 --> 03:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
little more time and uh get the
 
03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
information that we know is out there
 
03:27:43.950 --> 03:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
and uh then make a judgment about
 
03:27:47.790 --> 03:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
it I I don't um I I think getting
 
03:27:50.469 --> 03:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
information is is good but are are you
 
03:27:52.389 --> 03:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
are we focusing on the policy at that
 
03:27:53.910 --> 03:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
point when the policy's already been
 
03:27:55.870 --> 03:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
passed and we're supposed to look at
 
03:28:00.349 --> 03:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
what is the cost at this point that's uh
 
03:28:03.710 --> 03:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
I I understand that and uh I don't know
 
03:28:06.750 --> 03:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
as I I said at the beginning whether the
 
03:28:10.710 --> 03:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
objection um is just some blanket idea
 
03:28:14.990 --> 03:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
about uh uh Public Safety or whether it
 
03:28:21.389 --> 03:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:25.550 --> 03:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:29.349 --> 03:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
I I did not hear a fiscal issue that
 
03:28:31.830 --> 03:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
this committee is going to spend more
 
03:28:34.790 --> 03:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
time on productively but uh I leave it
 
03:28:37.590 --> 03:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
up to the chair and everybody else
 
03:28:39.189 --> 03:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
whether we need to defer
 
03:28:45.389 --> 03:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:48.750 --> 03:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
271 uh fails on
 
03:28:48.760 --> 03:28:51.830 align:start position:0%
271 uh fails on
78,2

03:28:51.830 --> 03:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:53.830 --> 03:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
inspections well I think we also heard
 
03:28:55.910 --> 03:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
that those fails were mostly glass
 
03:29:00.429 --> 03:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:04.830 --> 03:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
um uh represent Bolton what was that
 
03:29:07.830 --> 03:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
tires yeah so it's U the vehicle info
 
03:29:11.469 --> 03:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
was um glass is 139 tires 77 rear lights
 
03:29:15.150 --> 03:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
24 wipers 21 okay so the bulk of those
 
03:29:18.070 --> 03:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
are all
 
03:29:21.990 --> 03:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay anything else representative
 
03:29:24.990 --> 03:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
Erie yeah I might remind that uh you can
 
03:29:27.429 --> 03:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
have your car inspected and it can pass
 
03:29:29.349 --> 03:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
inspection on day one and on day two
 
03:29:29.359 --> 03:29:32.590 align:start position:0%
inspection on day one and on day two
it's

03:29:32.590 --> 03:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:35.870 --> 03:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
failed represent
 
03:29:40.189 --> 03:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
elme yes on I think that it's a der
 
03:29:45.229 --> 03:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
elction of Duty for us if we decide that
 
03:29:48.429 --> 03:29:48.439 align:start position:0%
the highway fund will be out the number
 
03:29:51.830 --> 03:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
of vehicles which I don't happen to know
 
03:29:59.070 --> 03:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
offand uh times 25 cents um if uh the
 
03:30:02.710 --> 03:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
sticker price is not also put up by 25
 
03:30:06.070 --> 03:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:10.110 --> 03:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
us so um would you does that imply yes
 
03:30:12.750 --> 03:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
represent and just to follow up on that
 
03:30:14.990 --> 03:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
if you buy a brand spanking new car and
 
03:30:17.269 --> 03:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
the dealer inspects it you can get up to
 
03:30:21.030 --> 03:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
18 months of inspection
 
03:30:26.389 --> 03:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
today all this does is say okay we're
 
03:30:29.870 --> 03:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
going from 18 months to 24
 
03:30:31.750 --> 03:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
months that's depending on when your
 
03:30:35.389 --> 03:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
birthday falls correct uh yeah depending
 
03:30:37.830 --> 03:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
like I said you can get up too you can
 
03:30:40.030 --> 03:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
get a year plus six
 
03:30:40.040 --> 03:30:41.750 align:start position:0%
get a year plus six
months

03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
months
 
03:30:44.389 --> 03:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay repr Aly did you
 
03:30:48.110 --> 03:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
have I did not quite understand talking
 
03:30:48.120 --> 03:30:51.710 align:start position:0%
have I did not quite understand talking
about

03:30:51.710 --> 03:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:54.269 --> 03:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
so would you like to
 
03:30:56.670 --> 03:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
elaborate well it depend So when you buy
 
03:30:59.110 --> 03:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
a car if it's if if your birthday is
 
03:31:00.590 --> 03:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
let's say is in June and you bought it
 
03:31:04.630 --> 03:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
in January you actually have until you
 
03:31:06.870 --> 03:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to inspect it in June you can
 
03:31:09.469 --> 03:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
go all the way to the next June as it is
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
now so there there's the EXT that
 
03:31:13.429 --> 03:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
example might be 17 months but that's
 
03:31:15.269 --> 03:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
the general
 
03:31:18.590 --> 03:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
idea representative leapley thank you Mr
 
03:31:18.600 --> 03:31:20.110 align:start position:0%
idea representative leapley thank you Mr
chair

03:31:20.110 --> 03:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:31:22.990 --> 03:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
um there's rightly been an emphasis on
 
03:31:26.189 --> 03:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue because that's our role um yet
 
03:31:28.710 --> 03:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
when we have a revenue question as with
 
03:31:31.630 --> 03:31:31.640 align:start position:0%
the the first bill we discussed we don't
 
03:31:34.229 --> 03:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
have we have you know parentheses and
 
03:31:36.750 --> 03:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
some math some different people did and
 
03:31:38.630 --> 03:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
then on the bill that we're discussing
 
03:31:41.550 --> 03:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
now there was an offer to to make it
 
03:31:44.070 --> 03:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
more Revenue neutral but that would
 
03:31:45.870 --> 03:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
require an amendment and our response
 
03:31:47.070 --> 03:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
was like yeah that's going to take too
 
03:31:49.189 --> 03:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
much time so it feels like we want to
 
03:31:51.670 --> 03:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
limit our discussion to revenue yet when
 
03:31:53.590 --> 03:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
we have questions about Revenue the
 
03:31:55.670 --> 03:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
response on the last two bills has been
 
03:31:58.950 --> 03:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
like yeah that's not a big deal so are
 
03:32:01.590 --> 03:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
we considering the revenue impacts of
 
03:32:04.389 --> 03:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
these bills it feels like we we kind of
 
03:32:07.070 --> 03:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
want to EXA today and so we're not
 
03:32:09.710 --> 03:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
pausing to maybe collect the revenue
 
03:32:11.790 --> 03:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
information that we need if if that
 
03:32:13.309 --> 03:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
indeed is supposed to be the function of
 
03:32:15.790 --> 03:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
this committee no I mean we're not going
 
03:32:18.429 --> 03:32:18.439 align:start position:0%
to we're not executing for the sake of
 
03:32:20.990 --> 03:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
executing if if people feel that we
 
03:32:23.309 --> 03:32:23.319 align:start position:0%
should add an amendment that that
 
03:32:25.349 --> 03:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
changes RSA
 
03:32:29.150 --> 03:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
266 colon 2 increasing it by 25 cents to
 
03:32:31.070 --> 03:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
make up that difference then you know
 
03:32:32.309 --> 03:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
then we can do
 
03:32:34.750 --> 03:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
that so I'll leave it up we'll leave
 
03:32:36.070 --> 03:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
we'll see where the committee falls on
 
03:32:37.550 --> 03:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
03:32:41.630 --> 03:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
PL I was happy to pass it as is uh it's
 
03:32:43.910 --> 03:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
with a small Revenue impact on it but uh
 
03:32:46.590 --> 03:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
if it makes people on the committee well
 
03:32:48.309 --> 03:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh ways of Means Committee more likely
 
03:32:50.269 --> 03:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
to pass it I'm willing to put an
 
03:32:53.150 --> 03:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
amendment in to uh do that raise the fee
 
03:32:57.229 --> 03:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
25 cents uh for the inspections uh it's
 
03:33:00.030 --> 03:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
so it's in the same bill so the revenue
 
03:33:02.030 --> 03:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
reduction is offset by a revenue
 
03:33:04.389 --> 03:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
increase yeah
 
03:33:06.830 --> 03:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative fellows I'm just
 
03:33:08.870 --> 03:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if anybody knows when the last
 
03:33:11.710 --> 03:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
time the the fee
 
03:33:14.790 --> 03:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
for inspection was put you know when it
 
03:33:17.630 --> 03:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
would have been set at the four what are
 
03:33:20.870 --> 03:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:24.389 --> 03:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
four 425 or whatever it is now when that
 
03:33:24.399 --> 03:33:28.670 align:start position:0%
four 425 or whatever it is now when that
was

03:33:28.670 --> 03:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:32.590 --> 03:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:35.469 --> 03:33:35.479 align:start position:0%
know how do people feel in general about
 
03:33:38.910 --> 03:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
um adding an amendment to to get 25
 
03:33:42.389 --> 03:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
cents back if we're passing ing this
 
03:33:46.110 --> 03:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:49.950 --> 03:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
that okay well representative Southworth
 
03:33:54.550 --> 03:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
remember 25 cents was um a um an
 
03:33:57.070 --> 03:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
estimate of the likely change because
 
03:33:59.630 --> 03:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
they really don't have exact figures
 
03:34:01.309 --> 03:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
yeah somebody said 25 and I think
 
03:34:03.309 --> 03:34:03.319 align:start position:0%
another person had come out with 23
 
03:34:04.790 --> 03:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
cents yeah it's somewhere in that
 
03:34:06.790 --> 03:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
ballpark so again if we are going to do
 
03:34:08.630 --> 03:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
an amendment you know let's just make
 
03:34:11.590 --> 03:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
sure we have close to the right amend
 
03:34:13.870 --> 03:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and not just an estimate that we
 
03:34:16.590 --> 03:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
heard you know right I mean I do agree
 
03:34:18.630 --> 03:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
with representative leapley I think we
 
03:34:20.030 --> 03:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
do have to dig a little bit more into
 
03:34:22.150 --> 03:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
the revenue on this committee to make
 
03:34:26.830 --> 03:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:31.830 --> 03:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:35.269 --> 03:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
okay all right anything
 
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
else okay close the work session on
 
03:34:39.680 --> 03:34:43.349 align:start position:0%
else okay close the work session on
1391

03:34:43.349 --> 03:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:51.189 --> 03:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
looking it wasn't handed out this is the
 
03:34:53.160 --> 03:34:55.229 align:start position:0%
looking it wasn't handed out this is the
only

03:34:55.229 --> 03:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:34:57.229 --> 03:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
copy um
 
03:34:57.239 --> 03:35:09.590 align:start position:0%
copy um
Susan

03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:09.600 --> 03:35:14.070 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:35:14.070 --> 03:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:17.590 --> 03:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh the fee for the sticker was last
 
03:35:20.870 --> 03:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
changed in 09 assuming that it wasn't
 
03:35:20.880 --> 03:35:21.910 align:start position:0%
changed in 09 assuming that it wasn't
another

03:35:21.910 --> 03:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:35:25.389 --> 03:35:25.399 align:start position:0%
change that that's quite a while ago yes
 
03:35:28.150 --> 03:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
maybe we should a lot of inflation AG go
 
03:35:30.349 --> 03:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
yeah just adjusting for inflation would
 
03:35:33.469 --> 03:35:33.479 align:start position:0%
more probably more than cover the 25
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:39.600 --> 03:35:42.150 align:start position:0%
 
whatever

03:35:42.150 --> 03:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:35:44.510 --> 03:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
Senator PL my offer to put an amendment
 
03:35:46.750 --> 03:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
is just so it's Revenue neutral out of
 
03:35:48.870 --> 03:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
this bill we're looking at changing the
 
03:35:51.269 --> 03:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
fee structure entirely I think that's
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
next year when we look we look at all
 
03:35:55.990 --> 03:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
fees and revenues and see whe the what
 
03:35:57.550 --> 03:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
what the needs are but I haven't heard
 
03:35:59.469 --> 03:35:59.479 align:start position:0%
any push that this was needed to be
 
03:36:02.510 --> 03:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
increased at all um that that it's
 
03:36:03.990 --> 03:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
covering the costs and that's that's
 
03:36:06.269 --> 03:36:06.279 align:start position:0%
what needs to be happen frankly I
 
03:36:07.830 --> 03:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't worry so much about the revenue
 
03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
loss except it's hitting the highway
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
fund which is uh pretty slim as it be is
 
03:36:15.670 --> 03:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
so I that's why I'm accepting the idea
 
03:36:17.389 --> 03:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
we may need an
 
03:36:17.399 --> 03:36:18.950 align:start position:0%
we may need an
amendment

03:36:18.950 --> 03:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:36:21.269 --> 03:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
03:36:24.910 --> 03:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
you all right um I'm going to open the
 
03:36:27.950 --> 03:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
work session on hb1
 
03:36:31.150 --> 03:36:31.160 align:start position:0%

03:36:32.309 --> 03:36:32.319 align:start position:0%

therapeutic

03:36:37.429 --> 03:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:41.910 --> 03:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis represent Al me oh sorry I just
 
03:36:46.950 --> 03:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
had that on but um I think we are all in
 
03:36:51.950 --> 03:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
favor of passing it the way it is
 
03:36:54.389 --> 03:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
is you're in favor of passing it the way
 
03:36:59.070 --> 03:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
it is um yes it on they're totally
 
03:37:01.750 --> 03:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
self-regulating they'll lower fees if
 
03:37:04.150 --> 03:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
this brings in enough money that they
 
03:37:09.389 --> 03:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:09.399 --> 03:37:12.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:15.510 --> 03:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:17.790 --> 03:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
comments okay saying none we'll close
 
03:37:22.110 --> 03:37:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:24.429 --> 03:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
1278 I'll now open the work session on
 
03:37:24.439 --> 03:37:25.349 align:start position:0%
1278 I'll now open the work session on
hb1

03:37:25.349 --> 03:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
03:37:27.469 --> 03:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
1429 establishing a procedure for the
 
03:37:29.910 --> 03:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services to
 
03:37:34.189 --> 03:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
transfer ownership of dams and uh I can
 
03:37:35.830 --> 03:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
guess what representative PL might say
 
03:37:38.510 --> 03:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
but I'll recognize him so he can say it
 
03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr chair I want to
 
03:37:44.229 --> 03:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
apologize for my strong feelings earlier
 
03:37:46.550 --> 03:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
but uh I did did not appreciate getting
 
03:37:49.710 --> 03:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
this letter the day of uh we're uh
 
03:37:52.590 --> 03:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
having the uh hearing and the work work
 
03:37:54.790 --> 03:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
session because we we could have had it
 
03:37:56.429 --> 03:37:56.439 align:start position:0%
quite a while ago and worked on it
 
03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't with in the last committee right
 
03:38:00.670 --> 03:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
now we have two choices like we can
 
03:38:03.630 --> 03:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
delay this exact because we got until
 
03:38:06.269 --> 03:38:06.279 align:start position:0%
March sometime I asked you foret and and
 
03:38:08.309 --> 03:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
try to get the language that's being
 
03:38:10.950 --> 03:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
drafted in the Senate into our version
 
03:38:12.750 --> 03:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
that's one op option the other is to
 
03:38:15.349 --> 03:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
just pass it it'll go to a committee of
 
03:38:17.189 --> 03:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
conference and accept the Senate's
 
03:38:20.349 --> 03:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
version essentially either way it
 
03:38:20.359 --> 03:38:22.790 align:start position:0%
version essentially either way it
works

03:38:22.790 --> 03:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
works
 
03:38:26.229 --> 03:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:29.670 --> 03:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
else yeah representative Bley um is did
 
03:38:31.830 --> 03:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
anyone from the municipal
 
03:38:31.840 --> 03:38:33.990 align:start position:0%
anyone from the municipal
Association

03:38:33.990 --> 03:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
Association
 
03:38:38.269 --> 03:38:38.279 align:start position:0%
come no from the what Municipal yeah um
 
03:38:39.590 --> 03:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
is there anyone from Municipal
 
03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:42.309 align:start position:0%
is there anyone from Municipal
Association

03:38:42.309 --> 03:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
Association
 
03:38:47.150 --> 03:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
no yes I'm sorry followup no she may I
 
03:38:50.750 --> 03:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
answer oh sure yeah not here but they
 
03:38:53.189 --> 03:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
did come when was in in the the last
 
03:38:55.710 --> 03:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
committee resources or whatever it was
 
03:38:58.750 --> 03:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
and they did impact the bill to make
 
03:39:00.429 --> 03:39:00.439 align:start position:0%
certain that their concerns were taken
 
03:39:04.710 --> 03:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:07.229 --> 03:39:07.239 align:start position:0%
were I guess I still have concerns
 
03:39:12.070 --> 03:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the letter um that this bill
 
03:39:14.309 --> 03:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
would impact not
 
03:39:19.710 --> 03:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
only dams owned by nhdes but also other
 
03:39:22.229 --> 03:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
departments and it sounds like that
 
03:39:29.830 --> 03:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:31.870 --> 03:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
consideration so I guess what I'm saying
 
03:39:34.910 --> 03:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
is I would I I think it makes sense to
 
03:39:36.790 --> 03:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
to hold on to this a little bit to see
 
03:39:38.630 --> 03:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
if we can answer the
 
03:39:41.830 --> 03:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
questions May respond again sure I it
 
03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
may make sense to delay it because there
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
dams that not owned by thees but by
 
03:39:48.510 --> 03:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
other state agencies we have to exempt
 
03:39:50.990 --> 03:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
them but new New Hampshire Municipal
 
03:39:53.670 --> 03:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
Association had no concern uh with
 
03:39:55.429 --> 03:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
respect to they didn't even think about
 
03:39:58.030 --> 03:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
the dams not owned by Dees they just
 
03:39:59.830 --> 03:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to make certain that the language
 
03:40:03.349 --> 03:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
covered Municipal concerns which uh and
 
03:40:06.349 --> 03:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
so it does so that that the two are not
 
03:40:07.750 --> 03:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
related New Hampshire Municipal
 
03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
Association and the uh dams that are not
 
03:40:14.830 --> 03:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:17.590 --> 03:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
agreed representative
 
03:40:20.990 --> 03:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
AMS yeah I guess I'm coming out on the
 
03:40:24.670 --> 03:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
side of more time for more than just the
 
03:40:28.229 --> 03:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
first bill I spoke of uh but I'd like to
 
03:40:31.269 --> 03:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
uh have a little more time to uh to
 
03:40:34.229 --> 03:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
determine whether we really should in
 
03:40:36.030 --> 03:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
order to act
 
03:40:38.950 --> 03:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
responsibly um make an amendment to this
 
03:40:43.590 --> 03:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
bill to catch the issue that was maybe
 
03:40:45.429 --> 03:40:45.439 align:start position:0%
too maybe late in the game but
 
03:40:48.110 --> 03:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
nonetheless it's in front of us that's
 
03:40:50.309 --> 03:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
been identified by
 
03:40:56.870 --> 03:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh by whoever by the uh U Dees and um by
 
03:41:00.910 --> 03:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
Scott I'll use the name um and uh and
 
03:41:03.510 --> 03:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
figure out if we can uh if we can
 
03:41:06.269 --> 03:41:06.279 align:start position:0%
identify it uh what what needs to be
 
03:41:07.790 --> 03:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
amended I think it's pretty simple
 
03:41:10.950 --> 03:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment as I understand it and and um
 
03:41:13.110 --> 03:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
then uh we'll have something we can go
 
03:41:16.070 --> 03:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
forward with with confidence and uh
 
03:41:19.309 --> 03:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
maybe uh we won't have to go through a
 
03:41:20.870 --> 03:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
conference committee with the senate in
 
03:41:22.750 --> 03:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
the end because we'll all be together on
 
03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
the same page and that would be good
 
03:41:29.830 --> 03:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay represent fellows um I have
 
03:41:33.750 --> 03:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about the potential impact on
 
03:41:35.950 --> 03:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
property values in a particular
 
03:41:39.349 --> 03:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
community and I think that one of the
 
03:41:41.830 --> 03:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
things it's not covered in here is I
 
03:41:46.189 --> 03:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
think that um removing a a dam that's on
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
a river and as long as that wouldn't
 
03:41:53.189 --> 03:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
cause any flooding issues that might be
 
03:41:55.670 --> 03:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay and the community might want to do
 
03:41:59.349 --> 03:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
something about that but the prospect
 
03:42:02.630 --> 03:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
that this could be used that would take
 
03:42:05.750 --> 03:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
down a dam that would lower the level of
 
03:42:08.670 --> 03:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
water on a lake and have a major impact
 
03:42:12.870 --> 03:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
on the values of homes on that property
 
03:42:15.870 --> 03:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
that I that to me that is like very
 
03:42:18.870 --> 03:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
wrong and so maybe there needs to be
 
03:42:22.550 --> 03:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
some kind of Distinction in here that
 
03:42:26.469 --> 03:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
covers that situation that says you know
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
provided there there's no impact on
 
03:42:33.910 --> 03:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
property values or provided the
 
03:42:37.070 --> 03:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
municipality certifies that it's that
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
they're good with it just I just have
 
03:42:42.510 --> 03:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
concerns related to that and it may not
 
03:42:48.670 --> 03:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
be an impact on Revenue to the state but
 
03:42:51.030 --> 03:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
it could you know that does impact
 
03:42:52.349 --> 03:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue to
 
03:42:56.229 --> 03:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities and certainly a huge huge
 
03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
U Financial uh impact on anybody who has
 
03:43:02.910 --> 03:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
a property that would be impacted by any
 
03:43:06.830 --> 03:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
change resident PL If This Were a dam
 
03:43:08.469 --> 03:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
being taken down in the middle of
 
03:43:11.389 --> 03:43:11.399 align:start position:0%
nowhere within a Incorporated Township
 
03:43:14.229 --> 03:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
and so that the uh water levels Reed but
 
03:43:17.149 --> 03:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
nobody lives there nobody cares and the
 
03:43:18.990 --> 03:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
uh municipality would not be willing to
 
03:43:20.590 --> 03:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
buy the dam from the state to just let
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
it happen the case in gsan and many
 
03:43:24.550 --> 03:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
other communities that this will
 
03:43:27.309 --> 03:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
eventually be affected by it's huge
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
because we there are properties on
 
03:43:30.590 --> 03:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
lakefront property they will no longer
 
03:43:32.990 --> 03:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
be lakefront property the the property
 
03:43:35.469 --> 03:43:35.479 align:start position:0%
value will be significally impacted the
 
03:43:37.950 --> 03:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
recreational value to the town goes down
 
03:43:40.990 --> 03:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
so we very much care and and the town
 
03:43:43.630 --> 03:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
has the option of uh in that case of of
 
03:43:44.950 --> 03:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
buying the land from the state and
 
03:43:46.910 --> 03:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
getting a loan to be able to take care
 
03:43:48.790 --> 03:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
of whatever it needs to to to keep the
 
03:43:51.710 --> 03:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
pro process going um so that's a
 
03:43:53.790 --> 03:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
decision to be made but the fact that
 
03:43:55.630 --> 03:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary by the town I think takes
 
03:43:57.510 --> 03:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
care of your concern they'd have to have
 
03:43:59.710 --> 03:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
significant economic impact before the
 
03:44:01.429 --> 03:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
town would
 
03:44:04.309 --> 03:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
care my understanding is right now like
 
03:44:07.950 --> 03:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
if this didn't exist the state can
 
03:44:10.670 --> 03:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
dismantle a dam as it is now so it's not
 
03:44:13.309 --> 03:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
like you pass this now you create that
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
problem it the problem you're talking
 
03:44:16.510 --> 03:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
about is already
 
03:44:21.149 --> 03:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I think U this illustrates why
 
03:44:26.510 --> 03:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't stray too far into policy
 
03:44:28.469 --> 03:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
matters that are beyond our
 
03:44:30.550 --> 03:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction I'm sure there are
 
03:44:34.590 --> 03:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
processes and rules and limitations on
 
03:44:38.670 --> 03:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
um that are uh go into a decision to
 
03:44:40.309 --> 03:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
remove a dam
 
03:44:43.990 --> 03:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
and uh we're you know that's beyond our
 
03:44:47.349 --> 03:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
ability to um get in well maybe it's not
 
03:44:49.990 --> 03:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
beyond our ability but we shouldn't get
 
03:44:51.910 --> 03:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
into that there are others that
 
03:44:55.870 --> 03:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
are able to do that so um I think onest
 
03:44:58.950 --> 03:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
face this is an option that uh this
 
03:45:04.910 --> 03:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
enables a process that uh right now
 
03:45:07.710 --> 03:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
um may be something that could be
 
03:45:10.229 --> 03:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
pursued but it's difficult uh allows
 
03:45:12.590 --> 03:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have a voice and an
 
03:45:15.030 --> 03:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
option but it doesn't mandate anything
 
03:45:17.429 --> 03:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
along those lines it does mandate that
 
03:45:19.990 --> 03:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
the uh Dees look at that
 
03:45:25.349 --> 03:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
option um and so um on his face it looks
 
03:45:27.750 --> 03:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
good except for the uh need for some a
 
03:45:29.550 --> 03:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
couple of amendments that have been
 
03:45:32.349 --> 03:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
flagged late late in the game but we
 
03:45:33.790 --> 03:45:33.800 align:start position:0%
need to look at
 
03:45:35.950 --> 03:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
them thank
 
03:45:40.670 --> 03:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
you any anybody else represent uh
 
03:45:44.950 --> 03:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you on what bothers me about
 
03:45:48.389 --> 03:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
this is the money for the dam
 
03:45:52.590 --> 03:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance revolving Loan Fund which um
 
03:45:55.070 --> 03:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
it has been brought up by the department
 
03:45:59.030 --> 03:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
that uh any money that Finance might
 
03:46:02.309 --> 03:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
move into this would probably come off
 
03:46:05.309 --> 03:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
of the money for the dam maintenance
 
03:46:08.070 --> 03:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
fund which is already in existence which
 
03:46:11.389 --> 03:46:11.399 align:start position:0%
is totally underfunded and which deals
 
03:46:13.630 --> 03:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
with the high-risk dams that are likely
 
03:46:14.870 --> 03:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
to kill
 
03:46:17.389 --> 03:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
people so
 
03:46:17.399 --> 03:46:19.070 align:start position:0%
people so
um

03:46:19.070 --> 03:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:19.080 --> 03:46:20.670 align:start position:0%
um
on

03:46:20.670 --> 03:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
frankly from my perspective assuming
 
03:46:27.110 --> 03:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee um did its
 
03:46:32.830 --> 03:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
job on on on priorities for this um if
 
03:46:38.269 --> 03:46:38.279 align:start position:0%
this goes in to 612 as a dedicated fund
 
03:46:41.389 --> 03:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
it'll probably sit there for 5 years
 
03:46:43.910 --> 03:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
unless there's some big Federal grant
 
03:46:47.550 --> 03:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
that comes through um and then we would
 
03:46:50.510 --> 03:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
repeal it if I'm still here other people
 
03:46:52.670 --> 03:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
would repeal it if I'm not because
 
03:46:54.630 --> 03:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
money dams in general have no
 
03:47:01.790 --> 03:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
money no damn
 
03:47:05.189 --> 03:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
money representative spillsbury
 
03:47:10.149 --> 03:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my comment uh
 
03:47:11.710 --> 03:47:11.720 align:start position:0%
is very much in sync with what
 
03:47:14.510 --> 03:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative Aly has just forecast and
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's as I stated earlier during the
 
03:47:20.189 --> 03:47:20.199 align:start position:0%
hearing that this bill without an
 
03:47:20.199 --> 03:47:21.630 align:start position:0%
hearing that this bill without an
Associated

03:47:21.630 --> 03:47:21.640 align:start position:0%
Associated
 
03:47:24.189 --> 03:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation doesn't really do anything
 
03:47:27.870 --> 03:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
the department right now can
 
03:47:30.309 --> 03:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
voluntarily uh get in contact with the
 
03:47:32.229 --> 03:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
town and offer them an option and give
 
03:47:36.429 --> 03:47:36.439 align:start position:0%
them a year so the purpose of requiring
 
03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
the department to make the offer
 
03:47:42.950 --> 03:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change what they can do now
 
03:47:45.030 --> 03:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's just associated with the whole
 
03:47:48.189 --> 03:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism of a financing well if we're
 
03:47:50.910 --> 03:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
not going to fund a loan a revolving
 
03:47:53.830 --> 03:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund the bill doesn't do
 
03:47:56.469 --> 03:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
anything I I don't particularly see the
 
03:47:58.990 --> 03:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of passing this
 
03:48:01.309 --> 03:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
bill representative PL do you have
 
03:48:04.030 --> 03:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
something to say yes I very much do it's
 
03:48:05.950 --> 03:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
enabling you're right that if the
 
03:48:07.910 --> 03:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
finance committee next year doesn't do
 
03:48:10.630 --> 03:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
squat with it the bill will eventually
 
03:48:13.710 --> 03:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh the the the dedicated fund that we're
 
03:48:16.229 --> 03:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
establishing will go away by this
 
03:48:18.550 --> 03:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
committee after after several years if
 
03:48:20.510 --> 03:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
the finance committee doesn't fund it
 
03:48:22.550 --> 03:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
but if without this enabling legislation
 
03:48:23.990 --> 03:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
the finance committee's got nothing to
 
03:48:27.309 --> 03:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
fund and so I that you need the
 
03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund established with a dollar
 
03:48:31.790 --> 03:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
in it so the finance committee can re
 
03:48:34.670 --> 03:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
respond to Dees requests next year and
 
03:48:37.309 --> 03:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
in future years just it's not clear to
 
03:48:40.030 --> 03:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
me what this enables
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:47.550 --> 03:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
today right well I think what
 
03:48:49.550 --> 03:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative Spiller is saying the
 
03:48:52.309 --> 03:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
town of gtown for example could go ahead
 
03:48:54.950 --> 03:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
now the difference with this bill would
 
03:48:57.630 --> 03:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
be if it's funded then there's a funding
 
03:49:00.030 --> 03:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism if it's not funded we could go
 
03:49:02.950 --> 03:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
Bond anyway uh but but this may be a
 
03:49:05.910 --> 03:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
better mechanism we want to establish
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
the dedicated fund so the finance
 
03:49:09.550 --> 03:49:09.560 align:start position:0%
committee has something to act on next
 
03:49:12.269 --> 03:49:12.279 align:start position:0%
year if this if the dedicated fund isn't
 
03:49:14.070 --> 03:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
there finance committee doesn't have
 
03:49:15.510 --> 03:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
anything to act on because it's what
 
03:49:17.750 --> 03:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
this committee establishes the dedicated
 
03:49:21.550 --> 03:49:21.560 align:start position:0%
funds not finance representative Edwards
 
03:49:23.950 --> 03:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks thanks Mr chair I just want
 
03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
to point out that the budgeting process
 
03:49:29.710 --> 03:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
starts with the governor's budget and
 
03:49:31.630 --> 03:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
and so we we're talking about finance
 
03:49:34.550 --> 03:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
committee pushing this but but the
 
03:49:36.910 --> 03:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
governor's budget would have to have
 
03:49:39.429 --> 03:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
something in it in nearly all
 
03:49:42.070 --> 03:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances we rarely step in and
 
03:49:44.229 --> 03:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
finance something that the the governor
 
03:49:48.870 --> 03:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:48.880 --> 03:49:51.110 align:start position:0%
 
mentioned

03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:49:54.229 --> 03:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
okay anything
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
else okay seeing none we'll I'll close
 
03:50:03.429 --> 03:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:06.269 --> 03:50:06.279 align:start position:0%
1429 I'll now open the work session on
 
03:50:09.429 --> 03:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
hb1 1626 relative to the repeal of
 
03:50:13.309 --> 03:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
certain Des um designated
 
03:50:13.319 --> 03:50:16.590 align:start position:0%
certain Des um designated
funds

03:50:16.590 --> 03:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:20.349 --> 03:50:20.359 align:start position:0%
and do I have any comments on this
 
03:50:23.429 --> 03:50:23.439 align:start position:0%
one representative Ames I think this is
 
03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
ready to
 
03:50:24.960 --> 03:50:28.110 align:start position:0%
ready to
go

03:50:28.110 --> 03:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:31.070 --> 03:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I'm
 
03:50:34.070 --> 03:50:34.080 align:start position:0%

03:50:36.510 --> 03:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor are you on board with ready
 
03:50:39.830 --> 03:50:39.840 align:start position:0%

03:50:43.790 --> 03:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
all right um any other comments
 
03:50:47.070 --> 03:50:47.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none oh representative
 
03:50:52.389 --> 03:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:55.349 --> 03:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
no okay I'm going to close the uh work
 
03:50:56.990 --> 03:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
session on HB
 
03:51:03.309 --> 03:51:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:07.229 --> 03:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
efficient okay so um it's 10 of
 
03:51:10.070 --> 03:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
two um
 
03:51:12.070 --> 03:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to um allocate a
 
03:51:13.830 --> 03:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of time to a
 
03:51:18.269 --> 03:51:18.279 align:start position:0%
caucus um and um 10 of two we probably
 
03:51:20.389 --> 03:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
need I don't think we need too much time
 
03:51:22.670 --> 03:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
maybe 15
 
03:51:26.389 --> 03:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
minutes so why don't we come back at uh
 
03:51:30.030 --> 03:51:30.040 align:start position:0%

04:11:02.590 --> 04:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
motion hold on one
 
04:11:06.359 --> 04:11:12.990 align:start position:0%
motion hold on one
second

04:11:12.990 --> 04:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:25.109 --> 04:11:25.119 align:start position:0%
need okay recognize representative PL
 
04:11:29.109 --> 04:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
for a motion I move ought to pass on
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1179
 
04:11:36.349 --> 04:11:36.359 align:start position:0%
FN do I have a second second Mr
 
04:11:36.359 --> 04:11:42.950 align:start position:0%
FN do I have a second second Mr
chairman

04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.030 --> 04:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh would you like to speak to your
 
04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
motion very simply it's a it's a a break
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
for veterans who deserve the break and
 
04:11:53.429 --> 04:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
the the cost is minimal $5,000 is what I
 
04:11:57.109 --> 04:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
heard so it's it's a no no-brainer to
 
04:12:01.389 --> 04:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:04.510 --> 04:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
Aly I still am worried because the park
 
04:12:12.870 --> 04:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
service is very underfunded always
 
04:12:17.710 --> 04:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
on on about what this fiscal note really
 
04:12:21.070 --> 04:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
is we have no official fiscal note or
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
anything from the Department uh about
 
04:12:28.910 --> 04:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
this and we just heard um
 
04:12:34.030 --> 04:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
from the dees group here that they don't
 
04:12:37.030 --> 04:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
get notified when we're receiving these
 
04:12:39.790 --> 04:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
bill bills and they only found out about
 
04:12:43.550 --> 04:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
it after the calendar came out on Friday
 
04:12:48.189 --> 04:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
which is why that letter was so late
 
04:12:54.030 --> 04:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
um but uh and the original fiscal note
 
04:13:02.750 --> 04:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
was looks minor to people here
 
04:13:06.189 --> 04:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
but 16,000 or something like that would
 
04:13:08.149 --> 04:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
take care of a fair on of Maintenance in
 
04:13:10.990 --> 04:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
the Park Service buildings that go
 
04:13:14.590 --> 04:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
unmaintained so um I'm going to vote for
 
04:13:17.189 --> 04:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
it with the understanding that they will
 
04:13:19.710 --> 04:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
find out about the Senate
 
04:13:23.990 --> 04:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
hearing and can come into
 
04:13:28.349 --> 04:13:28.359 align:start position:0%
that but okay uh I think we need to do

on HB
 
04:15:34.950 --> 04:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:38.670 --> 04:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
second second

04:15:46.990 --> 04:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
sod and uh representative spillsbury
 
04:15:49.229 --> 04:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your
 
04:15:53.070 --> 04:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
motion um yes thank you uh I think
 
04:15:55.389 --> 04:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
there's been some discussion about uh
 
04:15:58.950 --> 04:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not we need to uh uh revise
 
04:16:02.710 --> 04:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
the sticker fee um I don't think that
 
04:16:05.429 --> 04:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh we've had any testimony indicating
 
04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
how we would do that at what figure we
 
04:16:09.550 --> 04:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
would do it I think representative Aly
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
has fairly raised the question about
 
04:16:13.429 --> 04:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
passage of time since it was last
 
04:16:15.870 --> 04:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
adjusted but I think we can go ahead and
 
04:16:16.910 --> 04:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
pass the
 
04:16:20.710 --> 04:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
Bill let this go into effect and let the
 
04:16:23.349 --> 04:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh Department of Safety uh come back to
 
04:16:25.309 --> 04:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
us in the next session and tell us
 
04:16:28.070 --> 04:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
whether an adjustment is uh is warranted
 
04:16:31.429 --> 04:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
and and what adjustment that might be in
 
04:16:34.269 --> 04:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
the meantime we need to remember that
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
U this is not a a uh a fee or a program
 
04:16:41.469 --> 04:16:41.479 align:start position:0%
that's designed to raise revenue to fund
 
04:16:45.389 --> 04:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
the state it's simply a fee to cover the
 
04:16:46.349 --> 04:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
04:16:49.030 --> 04:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
administering and uh we're going to let
 
04:16:51.189 --> 04:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
roughly 880,000
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
Vehicles a year take a pass for two
 
04:16:57.109 --> 04:16:57.119 align:start position:0%
years um without having to worry really
 
04:17:00.349 --> 04:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
about safety issues so the revenue
 
04:17:02.630 --> 04:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
consequence is minimal and the
 
04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
adjustment can be made at a later
 
04:17:05.800 --> 04:17:07.550 align:start position:0%
adjustment can be made at a later
date

04:17:07.550 --> 04:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
date
 
04:17:07.560 --> 04:17:08.670 align:start position:0%
date
represent

04:17:08.670 --> 04:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
elme thank you I'm going to vote no on
 
04:17:15.269 --> 04:17:15.279 align:start position:0%
this if we have to vote on it now um
 
04:17:18.149 --> 04:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
because it is much harder in A
 
04:17:21.349 --> 04:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
legislature in which one party is
 
04:17:23.870 --> 04:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
condemned by the other party in public
 
04:17:28.109 --> 04:17:28.119 align:start position:0%
for raising taxes and fees all the time
 
04:17:32.790 --> 04:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh to um pass an increase separate from
 
04:17:35.189 --> 04:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
the need for it which is created by this
 
04:17:38.189 --> 04:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
bill in order to to maintain even the
 
04:17:40.750 --> 04:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
level that we were at in
 
04:17:43.590 --> 04:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
09 so
 
04:17:47.990 --> 04:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
um so I I personally
 
04:17:50.269 --> 04:17:50.279 align:start position:0%
disagree representative
 
04:17:53.309 --> 04:17:53.319 align:start position:0%
fellows um I would just like to ask
 
04:17:56.189 --> 04:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury to
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
explain um his statement that the money
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
raised from this is just to support the
 
04:18:05.349 --> 04:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
inspection program because in the fiscal
 
04:18:07.389 --> 04:18:07.399 align:start position:0%
note I see that part part of the money
 
04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
goes to the highway fund part to general
 
04:18:14.469 --> 04:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:18.630 --> 04:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
abatement sure um representative fellows
 
04:18:21.229 --> 04:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
glad to clarify I think your question is
 
04:18:23.710 --> 04:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
valid I didn't mean to say that the
 
04:18:26.109 --> 04:18:26.119 align:start position:0%
highway fund gets no benefit from the
 
04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
fees what I did mean to say is that we
 
04:18:34.790 --> 04:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
revenue okay thank you
 
04:18:37.600 --> 04:18:40.429 align:start position:0%
revenue okay thank you
um

04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:43.950 --> 04:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I'm going to vote no on this
 
04:18:49.389 --> 04:18:49.399 align:start position:0%
uh because I think uh there is no need
 
04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
to act today on this bill we've got
 
04:18:55.269 --> 04:18:55.279 align:start position:0%
until mid-march or
 
04:18:59.630 --> 04:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
so um and um we know there's more
 
04:19:03.030 --> 04:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
information out there the uh Department
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
of Public Safety has uh given written t
 
04:19:09.109 --> 04:19:09.119 align:start position:0%
testimony to the first committee um
 
04:19:12.870 --> 04:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
expressing their opposition to the bill
 
04:19:15.189 --> 04:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
now much of that opposition undoubtly
 
04:19:18.189 --> 04:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
isn't based on policy issues that are
 
04:19:21.189 --> 04:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
beyond the uh reach of this committee
 
04:19:25.269 --> 04:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
but um I'd like to see that testimony
 
04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
and make sure that it does not uh impact
 
04:19:33.070 --> 04:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
the U the kinds of issues that this
 
04:19:37.910 --> 04:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
committee is uh is uh here to adjust so
 
04:19:40.469 --> 04:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
I'm I see no reason for going forward on
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and if we have to go forward
 
04:19:43.309 --> 04:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote
 
04:19:46.429 --> 04:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
no okay representative fellows
 
04:19:50.109 --> 04:19:50.119 align:start position:0%

04:22:03.109 --> 04:22:03.119 align:start position:0%
users will get plowed back if not needed
 
04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
for the expenses into lowering the cost
 
04:22:07.590 --> 04:22:07.600 align:start position:0%

representative
 
04:23:28.870 --> 04:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
leapley not here uh I'll remember that
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
eventually representative Smith yes okay
 
04:23:34.950 --> 04:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
the vote is 190 one not voting the vote
 
04:23:37.790 --> 04:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
being 19 to zero and any objection to
 
04:23:40.149 --> 04:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
consent seeing
 
04:23:43.229 --> 04:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
none do you have an objection I'm sorry
 
04:23:45.550 --> 04:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just being contrarian for a moment
 
04:23:47.950 --> 04:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
um and you can overrule this easily I
 
04:23:51.790 --> 04:23:51.800 align:start position:0%
this this feels like such a
 
04:23:55.389 --> 04:23:55.399 align:start position:0%
consequential policy issue that I wonder
 
04:23:58.590 --> 04:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
if we should have it on consent and and
 
04:24:01.950 --> 04:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
I I'm just I'm just thinking out
 
04:24:05.149 --> 04:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
loud I would say no because um the
 
04:24:07.349 --> 04:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
policy committee has already ruled on
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
this um so the the the
 
04:24:15.469 --> 04:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
consequential of the revenue side seems
 
04:24:18.109 --> 04:24:18.119 align:start position:0%
Seems diminus
 
04:24:21.710 --> 04:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
dious um unless anyone else has a issue
 
04:24:27.030 --> 04:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:29.469 --> 04:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
consent close the exact session now on
 
04:24:29.479 --> 04:24:32.070 align:start position:0%
consent close the exact session now on
HB

04:24:32.070 --> 04:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:35.710 --> 04:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
1278 uh the next one HB 1429 we are not
 
04:24:40.269 --> 04:24:40.279 align:start position:0%
going to to exec um uh there's more time
 
04:24:43.510 --> 04:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
needed there uh representative PL is
 
04:24:45.070 --> 04:24:45.080 align:start position:0%

04:24:53.950 --> 04:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
drafting the Senate's that other body
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be saying uh Senate the other
 
04:24:57.550 --> 04:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
body is working on the amendment we'll
 
04:24:58.870 --> 04:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
just take the same language and put it
 
04:25:00.990 --> 04:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:25:05.070 --> 04:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
one okay
 
04:25:08.510 --> 04:25:08.520 align:start position:0%

second thank you represent ol
 
04:25:34.590 --> 04:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
s would you like to speak to your motion
 
04:25:37.229 --> 04:25:37.239 align:start position:0%
representative omy
 
04:25:41.670 --> 04:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
sure um this bill is primarily concerned
 
04:25:45.389 --> 04:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
with the repeal of a few dedicated funds
 
04:25:48.389 --> 04:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
that had lost all reason for
 
04:25:48.399 --> 04:25:50.229 align:start position:0%
that had lost all reason for
existence

04:25:50.229 --> 04:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
existence
 
04:25:54.349 --> 04:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
um I was asked a question about the one
 
04:25:58.550 --> 04:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
that removed the pesi training program
 
04:26:02.710 --> 04:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
they had uh in agriculture they had
 
04:26:05.429 --> 04:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
moved the pesticides tra training
 
04:26:11.149 --> 04:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
program over to UNH and let them get the
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
fees um so having having a non-existent
 
04:26:20.750 --> 04:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
program was not in the cards um and and
 
04:26:24.790 --> 04:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
then the other half of this is making
 
04:26:29.030 --> 04:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
changes to the licensing of dog fees not
 
04:26:33.070 --> 04:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
at the license level but at the level uh
 
04:26:37.429 --> 04:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
uh not at the level of municipality
 
04:26:42.389 --> 04:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
versus State portions but at the level
 
04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
of how much of of that joint fee goes to
 
04:26:52.070 --> 04:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
um Animal
 
04:26:55.790 --> 04:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
Control uh fees that is spay a neuter
 
04:27:00.830 --> 04:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
and how much of it goes to this state um
 
04:27:06.149 --> 04:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
on lab uh Veterinary Diagnostic lab um
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:27:12.790 --> 04:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
latter has been doing less um work
 
04:27:16.630 --> 04:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
checking for acade EP
 
04:27:20.910 --> 04:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
epidemics uh and than they had been
 
04:27:23.469 --> 04:27:23.479 align:start position:0%
doing before because we weren't giving
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
them enough money and we weren't giving
 
04:27:27.870 --> 04:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
them enough money because it had been
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
set in statute how much went there and
 
04:27:33.750 --> 04:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
how much went to the spay and neuter the
 
04:27:37.109 --> 04:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
spay and neuter has been having Less
 
04:27:39.870 --> 04:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
business uh over the years because I
 
04:27:43.349 --> 04:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
think of the success of the program um
 
04:27:45.990 --> 04:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
in reducing the wild
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
populations and uh and they had too much
 
04:27:54.309 --> 04:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
money so we moved the money sources so
 
04:27:59.510 --> 04:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
that span neuter got less and um the
 
04:28:03.510 --> 04:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
animal population control uh got less
 
04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
and and the diagnos IC lab got more they
 
04:28:11.590 --> 04:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
also Diagnostic lab as I remember also
 
04:28:16.189 --> 04:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
had uh has had his expenses grow because
 
04:28:18.590 --> 04:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
of inflation and the costs of chemicals
 
04:28:18.600 --> 04:28:19.540 align:start position:0%
of inflation and the costs of chemicals
and

04:28:19.540 --> 04:28:19.550 align:start position:0%
