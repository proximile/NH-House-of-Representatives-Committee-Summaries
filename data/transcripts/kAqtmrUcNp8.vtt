this meeting of the house election law
 
00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
committee we're going to start off with
 
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
the public hearing for hb1 1446 FN local
 
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
relative to eliminating the costs for
 
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
electronic copies of the checklist and
 
00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
representative Claudine Burnham is
 
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
committee um so yes this um HB
 
00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
1446 is um pretty simple uh there's a
 
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
fee that's attached to the requests of a
 
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
voter's checklist in town and at the
 
00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office of $25 so
 
00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 align:start position:0%
this um Bill reduces that electronic
 
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
copies this would just be for electronic
 
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
copies of the voters
 
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
checklist um from the current cost of
 
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
$25 to a zero cost to the request to the
 
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
one requesting the copy um I requested a
 
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
copy last September it took less than 2
 
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
minutes and I had to pay $25 and it came
 
00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 align:start position:0%
as a PDF so um it it's kind of seems
 
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
silly to charge that amount um to get a
 
00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 align:start position:0%
copy of that um there's no extra time
 
00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 align:start position:0%
and it's a simple process I understand
 
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
that there is a fiscal note um
 
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
that the Secretary of State's office
 
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
would potentially lose over $180,000 in
 
00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue um um but this is public
 
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
information and with a very little
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
effort to send it electronically or by a
 
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
um USB
 
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 align:start position:0%
device um is
 
00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
um makes it easier to for the transfer
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
and um I think it's fair for those um
 
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
who are requesting it to receive it at
 
00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
no cost I would be comfortable with the
 
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
not being uh collected for that very
 
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.110 align:start position:0%
not being uh collected for that very
reason

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
um so uh as far as with the towns um I
 
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
don't know about the other towns uh loss
 
00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
and revenue but I'm the only one that's
 
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
requested a copy so that wasn't a huge
 
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
loss for my town either so with that I
 
00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
would um ask you to consider to pass
 
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
this through and um make it a easier to
 
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
get electronic copies will you be taking
 
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
questions I can are there questions from
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
the committee representative wood is
 
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
recognized yes thank you for taking my
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
question um are you do you know how
 
00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
often the um the voter role or voter
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
list is is changed is updated
 
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
um it I think that as I don't know as
 
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
far as uh the state level but in the
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
towns I would assume um it depends on
 
00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 align:start position:0%
when people
 
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
are remember if it's um
 
00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 align:start position:0%
how often it is for the the actual copy
 
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
to be presented but I know in my town if
 
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
there are changes they'll updated every
 
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
few months especially right before
 
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
elections as the newest copy yeah was a
 
00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
little bit of a trick question because
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
I've been having trouble finding that
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
out it cost me $76 to get the voter
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
roles for Chester and Pittsville those
 
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
are the two towns that I represent and
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know and I end up getting the
 
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
list this probably more often than I
 
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
need to because I really don't know and
 
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing I get a uh
 
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
electronic copy of it so I think maybe
 
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh somebody else can ask that answer
 
00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
that question but I think in this day
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
and age it would be really nice if 3:00
 
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
in the morning I could pull that down
 
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
offline but that's just my two cents so
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
I know I got nothing else to do thank
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Howard's
 
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh so have
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
you spoken to the clerk's Association or
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
any of your town clerks uh about this
 
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
bill and in the drafting process um I
 
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
have talked to um the Town Clerk and uh
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
he was a bit surprised that there's a
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
fee for the electronic version because
 
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
really it's it doesn't take much
 
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
especially if it's in a PDF but and you
 
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
can also transfer to an Excel
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet it's um it's not cumbersome
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take much time
 
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.390 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take much time
so

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.150 align:start position:0%
so
yep

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.230 align:start position:0%
yep
president

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
president
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
Bay thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I I did go to my
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
town clerk last September also to get
 
00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:13.479 align:start position:0%
the I paid the $25 I brought my new um
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh USB thumb drive um is the $25 fee is
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
that causing any
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
hardship uh to anyone who would need it
 
00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
or would want it and what kind of hard
 
00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
they give me a description of what type
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
of hardship that's causing um I I don't
 
00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
believe there's a hardship but at the
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
same time it should be public access
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
information um and
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
um where it's not costing the town very
 
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
much to do that in an electronic form
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
they're not taking time to print out or
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
get paper things like that um and so I I
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
just I just think it's a kind of a uh
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
senseless fee when it could just be done
 
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
Wood please turn your mic on represent
 
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
sorry um do you know if other states um
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
charge in are there any other states
 
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
that don't charge I guess that's what I
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask for yes good question
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
thank you um yes so apparently there is
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
I know that somebody will be speaking on
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
that um the details but uh some states
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
do charge a lot more and some states
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't charge anything
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you but they'll I'm sure
 
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919 align:start position:0%
you'll get more details
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
soon further
 
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
questions representive
 
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
Howard so uh why did you make the
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
decision to have the town Supply the
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
external storage uh rather than allow
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
people to bring their own hard drives in
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh yeah good question yes so when we
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
were um drafting that that came up um as
 
00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
more of a safety feature um so certainly
 
00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959 align:start position:0%
I believe if you can bring a brand new
 
00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:11.079 align:start position:0%
one but
 
00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh um it would I I think it just gives a
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
little bit more security for the town
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
level um and the state level to provide
 
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.350 align:start position:0%
level um and the state level to provide
that

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
followup uh do you have an estimated
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
cost that it could be per town I mean
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
just across the
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
state for the USBs yes um well I just
 
00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
paid $7.99 I think for a pretty good
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
quality one so if you buy them in bulk
 
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it could be a lot less all
 
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
you awesome any further questions all
 
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
right thing done thank you uh
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.069 align:start position:0%

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
can you turn on your microphone oh there
 
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
we go thank you thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
you committee members um what I want to
 
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh as a co-sponsor of the bill I want to
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
just uh run through a few facts related
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
to the checklist to uh touch on the
 
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
imperative nature of having access to
 
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:20.910 align:start position:0%
imperative nature of having access to
this

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
information in the 2020 general election
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
the voter uh role lists were calculated
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
to have a total of 1 million 11
 
00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:35.079 align:start position:0%
19,23 to voters in 2021 the 10-year
 
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
voter list Purge or voter role list
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
verification required under RSA
 
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
654 col 39 had a net removal of
 
00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
approximately 21% of the state's voter
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
role list reducing the list down to a
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
calculated total of
 
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.310 align:start position:0%
calculated total of
879

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
879
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
279 voter or a difference in uh over a
 
00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
quarter of a million votes actually to
 
00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
239 uh
 
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
1,953 voters so if you compare so that's
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
roughly a 21% drop if you compare the
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
change in
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
population during that same period of
 
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
time New Hampshire had approximately a
 
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.550 align:start position:0%
time New Hampshire had approximately a
5.1%

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
5.1%
 
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
growth um so if the number of reduced
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
voters on the checklist accounts for
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
transfers in and out of New Hampshire as
 
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
well as
 
00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
deaths um you have you know
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
approximately uh 16% unaccounted for now
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
some of that might be voters voting for
 
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
the first time other factors like that
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
but it's a huge change in the number of
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
people on the checklist which is
 
00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:52.519 align:start position:0%
indicative of the fact that all
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
checklists are perhaps not being
 
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
properly maintained therefore I think
 
00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
it's incumbent upon candid Cates and
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
other concerned voter interest groups to
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
be able to have access to this
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
information so that they may verify it
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
on a local or wider level I would also
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
add that based upon a voter Integrity
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
group that provided affidavits for
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
voters who were no longer in their
 
00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
residence and voting so they were
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
identified as voters then it was
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
verified whether or not that they were
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh domiciled or residing in their listed
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
address and and there were over 15,000
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
affidavits submitted
 
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general pointing out
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
that these voters were not had voted in
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
the 2020 election but were not domiciled
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
or in their residence as identified at
 
00:12:51.389 --> 00:12:51.399 align:start position:0%
the time of the voting so um this is
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be uh able to be
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
verified at the local level uh there are
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
other bills coming up in the future so
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
you'll probably hear these numbers a few
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
times more from me um I like to think of
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
it as people like to say our elections
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
and say are safe and secure I think the
 
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
safest and most secure thing uh in the
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
2020 election apparently was the
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
checklist because they were not altered
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
at all um so I think it is uh you know
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
just to kind of put a bow on the ri uh
 
00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
ribbon and Bo on the package here it is
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
important that the cost be minimal for
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
electronic copies so that candidates can
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
have access and other interested groups
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
can have access to make sure that our
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
checklists have the Integrity needed now
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
this is not casting aspersions on any
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
local supervisors of the checklist I am
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
sure that they are doing the best that
 
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
they can um but sometimes uh voters who
 
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
have that interest or candidates who
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
have that interest can invest additional
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
time resources that perhaps are not
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
provided or available to the supervisors
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the checklist so that's all I have to
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
say on that matter questions from the
 
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
committee representative Bay thank you
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
question you alluded to a minimal fee uh
 
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
which is it seems to be inconsistent
 
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
with eliminating the cost so when you're
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
when you refer to a minimal fee what fee
 
00:14:30.509 --> 00:14:30.519 align:start position:0%
would that be what's the minimal fee
 
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
so the the minimal fee might be for
 
00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:34.759 align:start position:0%
example if they wanted to send it
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
instead of emails put it on a thumb
 
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
drive so I think the value mentioned was
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
$799 before for a secure transfer of
 
00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.629 align:start position:0%
$799 before for a secure transfer of
electronic

00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
information followup followup so um the
 
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
minimal fee will just be for the
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
physical uh vehicle for transferring
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
that data yes the data should already
 
00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:00.759 align:start position:0%
exist so therefore the transfer of the
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
electronic information really should be
 
00:15:05.749 --> 00:15:05.759 align:start position:0%
no cost at all if in fact Hardware is
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
involved if they choose instead of
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
emailing the information to transfer it
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
through a thumb drive for flash drive
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
then there would be some minimal fee
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
associated with that or minimal cost
 
00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:19.959 align:start position:0%
associated with that I think um in fact
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
in my own town uh when someone recently
 
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
requested electronic information they
 
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
actually asked that they provide a
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
secure thumb drive that had not been
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
opened so the package was intact from
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
one of the local stores providing that
 
00:15:39.309 --> 00:15:39.319 align:start position:0%
sort of thing so the the town was happy
 
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
to take that unopen package um and then
 
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
use the thumb drive in that package so
 
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
in fact if if such an arrangement were
 
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
made with the town then the town would
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
have absolutely no expenditure other
 
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
than pressing the appropriate buttons to
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
affect the exchange of electronic
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
information thank
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
questions okay um Ron B want to follow
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
up so um do you think that that the cost
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
of labor for actually putting together
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
database and extracting uh the
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
information that you need is uh
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.430 align:start position:0%
information that you need is uh
zero

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
zero
 
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
at the local level or at the secretary
 
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
of state level wherever you think that
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
work is getting done because it's like
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
there there's a fee it's like even if if
 
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
I'm uh maintaining a database you ask me
 
00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:45.079 align:start position:0%
for something I push the button and say
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
here it is the the the the pushing the
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
button and the two seconds that it took
 
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
or I don't know two minutes is is
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
probably just the face of it but there
 
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.069 align:start position:0%
probably just the face of it but there
is

00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
work that cost labor that's involved in
 
00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
making sure that when you come to me it
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
only takes me two seconds so if you're
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the labor associated with
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
creating the checklist of course that
 
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
would be the responsibility of the
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist which is a
 
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
usually an elected position most towns
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
and City
 
00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
Wards further
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
questions hearing none Thank You
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
represenative Weary um representative
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
pelli you are up
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.230 align:start position:0%

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
since you're the first person not say
 
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
welcome to election law thank you good
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for hearing my
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is Susan
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
representative Susan pelli I represent
 
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
District 19 in Rockingham Hampton Falls
 
00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
and Kensington and we're two small
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
towns I support this bill to eliminate
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
the cost for an electronic copy of a
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
checklist that is in a sortable
 
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
format communicating with our voters is
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
an integral part of our democracy and it
 
00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:12.919 align:start position:0%
is a pivotal point for our right of free
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
speech I believe having access to this
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
data will encourage civic participation
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
which is De desperately needed in our
 
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.590 align:start position:0%
which is De desperately needed in our
small

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
towns as you know as rep candidates we
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
don't have access access to unlimited
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
funds so charging for data that's
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
already available can be detrimental to
 
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
those that are wishing to seek office at
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
a local level or to support a particular
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
issue in
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
town our rep candidates really need to
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
have access to this data but think about
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
the participation that we want from our
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
small and large towns we have many
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
different offices
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
and um causes that would benefit from
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
this type of data so if you are running
 
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
for your planning board or your school
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
board or if you have a committee that
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
has a particular issue and you want to
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
communicate with your constituents this
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
data is absolutely
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
invaluable I spoke to my town clerk they
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
are fully in support of providing this
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
data they already
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
have it from the secretary of state so
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I think it's very important
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
to have this bill pass on a
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
bipartisan way so that we can show in
 
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we support our elected
 
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.909 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we support our elected
officials

00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
officials
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
our constituents that have U reasons to
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
communicate with our voters and our
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
voters to respect them so that we could
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
effectively so the the fee could prevent
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
certain citizens our citizen
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
legislature from accessing this data
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately and that fee could deter
 
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.510 align:start position:0%
appropriately and that fee could deter
their

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
participation as far as the external
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
drive goes I'm sure everyone knows what
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
they look like I found on Amazon you
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
could purchase 10 of these in a 10pack
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
for the cost of about
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
$2 and as already stated it would be
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
very coste effective for someone to
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
bring in their own thumb drive in a
 
00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:47.559 align:start position:0%
package that's unopened to make sure
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
that we maintain Security on our systems
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion I am fully in support
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
of this bipartisan effort to be able ble
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
to provide data to our elected officials
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
to our local level Grassroots organizers
 
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
to towns people that have a particular
 
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
interest in an issue and be able to
 
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
fully communicate with our constituents
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
without the barrier of a FEI thank Youk
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.750 align:start position:0%

representative

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
Hamlet thank you um Mr chair thank you
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so is the
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
checklist that's created by the
 
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist of the town
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
is that in a sortable format yes and
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
it's also available from the Secretary
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
of State in that sortable format so I'm
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
sure we're all interest um familiar with
 
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
you know workbook type software Excel
 
00:21:53.549 --> 00:21:53.559 align:start position:0%
Etc okay and it's very helpful to be
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
able to have that format so you can sort
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
and especially how many here have gone
 
00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:02.919 align:start position:0%
door knocking so especially you know we
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire we have the we are
 
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
so unique that we communicate directly
 
00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:11.559 align:start position:0%
with our voters and being able to have
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
that in a sortable format so you can
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
look and say okay um on Main Street
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
today who who would I like to talk to on
 
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
Main Street today as opposed to a format
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
that does not lend itself to sorting and
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
it becomes very onerous especially in
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
larger communities okay thank you thank
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
you further questions seeing none thank
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
you um next up secretary of state
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
done well done give him a quick Round of
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
team well thank you Mr chairman members
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm David scanland
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and uh I'm not here
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
to take a position uh on this bill
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
because this is clearly uh in the domain
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
of the legislature to decide how much uh
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
should be charged for uh checklists from
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
the voter
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
database I will say that
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
historically uh there has been a charge
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
for these lists um the database has
 
00:23:21.789 --> 00:23:21.799 align:start position:0%
existed since probably around
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
2006 prior to that checklists were
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
passed out in paper form and I believe
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
the charge was
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
$25 per checklist uh at that time to do
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
that uh and that price structure has
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
carried forward today again as a matter
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
of policy uh of the state
 
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
legislature the supervisors of the
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
checklist in every town are the ones
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
that are responsible for for maintaining
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
the list uh they are the only
 
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
individuals the only the only officials
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
election officials that are authorized
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
authorized to put names on the list and
 
00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
remove names from the list and they're
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
required to meet by Statute at certain
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
times of the year usually immediately
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
preceding uh elections or town
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
meetings uh and to make adjustments uh
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
to provide for new registrations after
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
an election is over so the supervisors
 
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
do all the all the grunt work uh in
 
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
terms of M maintaining that list they
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
maintain the list in the Statewide voter
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
registration database and the database
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
itself is maintained and administered uh
 
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
from the technical standpoint by the
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh by individuals
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
in my office at the secretary of
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
state so uh as a result of that uh
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
checklists can be provided in electronic
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
format um and
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh and the statute requires that there's
 
00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
a fee uh that is associate associated
 
00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:06.789 align:start position:0%
a fee uh that is associate associated
with

00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
that if it is the policy of the
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislature to eliminate the fee then I
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
think there are certain additional
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
policy uh decisions that also have to be
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
made uh number one is that this language
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh in the proposed
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
legislation requires that the checklist
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
be made available by
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
email and I would like to say that I
 
00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:35.799 align:start position:0%
don't think the technology currently
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
exists to allow that to happen in every
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
instance uh the file is huge and and I
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
know that if somebody was acquiring a
 
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
Statewide list it simply we simply could
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
not send it by email so my suggestion is
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
that that be a May and not a shall um
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
some of the small towns might be able to
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
transfer that data by email but um I
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
think for the most part it would be more
 
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
practical to deliver it on a thumb drive
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh which you have
 
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
seen as was mentioned I know that if
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
somebody's acquiring the list from the
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
state and I think this is true in most
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
towns we require that we provide the
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
media that that the information goes on
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to insert a a form
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
of media that we have no idea where it's
 
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
been uh and what might be on it that
 
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
could uh cause security issues with our
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
uh database
 
00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:41.559 align:start position:0%
system and then the last concern uh well
 
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
um the money that is collected uh
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
through the sale of those lists uh and
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
even the ones at the state level go back
 
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
to the cities and towns to help them
 
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
cover the costs of maintaining the list
 
00:26:57.549 --> 00:26:57.559 align:start position:0%
they help pay for the time that uh the
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
that the supervisor spend uh maintaining
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
that list and as you saw on the fiscal
 
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
note there's roughly
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
$171,000 a year that gets back to the
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
get that gets sent back to the cities
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
and towns uh for that purpose again
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
that's a policy decision of the
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
legislature to make the concern that I
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
would have that if that fee was
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
eliminated and there would be a
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
natural uh restraint that would be
 
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
removed from the number of requests for
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
checklists that would be made uh I think
 
00:27:36.269 --> 00:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
that that if if the checklist is
 
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
basically free it's going to
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
dramatically increase the number of
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
these that gets sent out and not only
 
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
checklist at at the Statewide level
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
changes every single day and I could
 
00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
Envision situations where the same
 
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
individual would be requesting that list
 
00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
once a week uh because there's no cost
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh to do that and that would uh you know
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
that would cause uh probably a
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
requirement for some additional staff
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
just to help manage that uh uh that
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
scenario so uh that's really all that I
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
have to offer but I would be happy to
 
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative wood thank you
 
00:28:21.509 --> 00:28:21.519 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you for answering my
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
questions every day cost me $76 for Two
 
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
Towns we have four elections this year
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
do I do it four times I that's my
 
00:28:36.029 --> 00:28:36.039 align:start position:0%
concern and that's the reason why I
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
think this bill is the other thing you
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned is uh you think it would
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
increase the number so it it seems to
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
make the bill in my opinion valuable uh
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
I don't see people collecting databases
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
for sport and uh I I don't mean to
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
testify sorry what's your feeling on
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
that um I I I I think you kind of help
 
00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:57.950 align:start position:0%
that um I I I I think you kind of help
us

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
in in your uh in what you say well like
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
I said I'm not taking a position on the
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
bill one way or the other I'm just
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
providing okay the facts and and what I
 
00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:10.039 align:start position:0%
see happening if this version of the
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass yeah can I follow up
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
please um well we we go other Members
 
00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
First where we allow followup
 
00:29:16.279 --> 00:29:17.630 align:start position:0%
First where we allow followup
representative

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
Bay thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:24.919 align:start position:0%
taking my question um when we request um
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
data for uh what are the data fields
 
00:29:32.909 --> 00:29:32.919 align:start position:0%
that are included uh I know what I got
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
from my town clerk but I don't know like
 
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
did they give me all I can ask for I
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
could have asked for but what are
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
included when the when data are
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
released the data fields that are
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
collected are everything that is in the
 
00:29:49.149 --> 00:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
public version of the checklist and so
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
that would be the voter's name their
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
party affiliation both their mailing
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
address and their physical address
 
00:29:59.789 --> 00:29:59.799 align:start position:0%
uh it would
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
include um a voter history for a
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
two-year period I believe those are the
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
those are the key elements but it would
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
be everything that is on the public
 
00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:13.799 align:start position:0%
list follow we got other Members First
 
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
do other members have a question all
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
right then we'll go back to
 
00:30:16.799 --> 00:30:17.789 align:start position:0%
right then we'll go back to
representative

00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
wood I I will refrain from uh um
 
00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:23.559 align:start position:0%
debating the bill I assume you're going
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
to be back here uh when we we bring the
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
bill to the uh committee but I did have
 
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
one question on um you provide a lot of
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
data now and again 2 o'clock in the
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
morning I'm on there I got every
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
election result from uh the primary
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
broken down by you know by uh um um
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
District by towns um just click a link
 
00:30:51.509 --> 00:30:51.519 align:start position:0%
and I get all that data why can't oh
 
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:53.799 align:start position:0%
would you be for doing a similar thing
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
database

00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
the the the statutes that are currently
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
on the books are very clear in the
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
database what is private and conf
 
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
confidential data to each individual
 
00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:12.919 align:start position:0%
voter and we feel feel very strongly
 
00:31:12.919 --> 00:31:13.830 align:start position:0%
voter and we feel feel very strongly
about

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
protecting information that should
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
remain private and confidential the the
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
public part of the list is uh searchable
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
I mean you can get it in an access
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
database format or uh a spreadsheet and
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
you can manipulate uh those data fields
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
in whatever you know way you want to
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
orient them or you know sort them
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
out the
 
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
um because we have so much data that
 
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
there are uh you know there are certain
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
um informative fields that we could
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
probably Aggregate and you know report
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
on you know on the basis of percentages
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
and things like that
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
that would not provide unique
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
identifiers but but I think that's a
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
different I think that's a different
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
topic thank you represent Bay thank you
 
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.830 align:start position:0%
topic thank you represent Bay thank you
Mr

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
chair um so when you said if its emails
 
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
probably be too big so it has to be a
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
different uh electronic mechanism I'm
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
imagining uh you're going to have a VPN
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
site where we can all go and and grab it
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
are there
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
any um like I don't know probably
 
00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:31.559 align:start position:0%
encryption or or or ways so that this
 
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
data are uh not something that can be
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
used in egregious manners um like of I'm
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
glad you didn't say email but let's say
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
if if there's emails like oh my God
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
they're using it for for for spam but
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
are there certain things that can be
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
done so that the data are protected for
 
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.430 align:start position:0%
done so that the data are protected for
the

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
database okay again we're talking about
 
00:32:59.950 --> 00:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
the public data that everybody has a
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
right to see so when we are putting it
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
on uh Electronic
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
media uh for the individual that has
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
requested it there really isn't a need
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
to uh encrypt
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
it there is no other reason to be
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
sharing other information that's in the
 
00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:19.720 align:start position:0%
database and we don't so uh we really
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
haven't been in that situation where we
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
have had to encrypt that data thank you
 
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
any further questions hearing none thank
 
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:29.559 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr Grace you're up next with the
 
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
Association thank you Mr chair n gra for
 
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:44.919 align:start position:0%
uh we do oppose this bill um really the
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
secretary outlined our concerns um
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
realistically our major concern here is
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh the cost and the loss of Revenue to
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities which the Secretary of
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
State's office was able to provide to
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
um I do want to note that if it is the
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee's uh interest in passing this
 
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
legislation um I would make one
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
suggestion um which is to adjust that $5
 
00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
charge for the flash drive to be um in
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
line with the actual cost of copying
 
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
that would uh that would cause
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
the bill to fall more in line with the
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
existing rights to no law um it would
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
reflect what the Supreme Court said in
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
Taylor versus SAU 55 um back in 2017
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
where the issue was the cost of a one of
 
00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
the issues was the cost of a flash drive
 
00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
$749 we heard testimony today um from
 
00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:44.839 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor that the cost is
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
$7.99 and another individual that was $2
 
00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
for a 10 pack um by fixing the fee at
 
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
$5 that may or may not be enough to
 
00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
cover the cost um really realistically
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
if we could just have it at the actual
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
cost that would be beneficial so that
 
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers aren't subsidizing these
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
requests in that manner I'm happy to
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
take questions questions from the
 
00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:11.079 align:start position:0%

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
record my name is Katherine LEL I'm
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
public policy fellow with open democracy
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
action I'm a 20-year-old voter in
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
conquered uh open democracy uh
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
represents voters from across the state
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire all from a variety of
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
different backgrounds and experiences
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
and including a variety of town clerks
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
and supervisors of the checklist um the
 
00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
proposed bill in its current form would
 
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate oh I'm sorry I we oppose this
 
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
bill um the proposed bill in its current
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
form would eliminate the cost of
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
obtaining electronic copies of the
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
checklist however in it keeping with
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
current local and Municipal laws this
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
would not eliminate the cost of
 
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
accessing this document from towns that
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
have a fee written into their fee
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
schedule um we contacted Michelle Stayin
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
from the Franklin City manager's office
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
she serves as Franklin's town clerk um
 
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
in an effort to gain some perspective on
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
this bill and its proposed effects she
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
said we do have this fee in our fee
 
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
schedule as a city I believe we would
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
still charge it because of this under
 
00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
chapter 160 fees there is a spot that
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
states quote checklist with a fee of $25
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
plus 50 per uh 1,000 names in excess of
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
2,500 um if I'm misunderstanding this
 
00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
please feel free to correct me uh
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
secretary scanlin or anyone else um
 
00:37:05.069 --> 00:37:05.079 align:start position:0%
however I we reached out in an effort to
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
gain some perspective on this labor
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
costs for a person's effort are not
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
unheard of in our economy and keeping
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
public records updated and responsibly
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
kept is a task that's often overlooked
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
and undervalued um it seems only fair
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
that a task that takes some effort for
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
an employee of the community to be able
 
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
to charge a fee it seems to make sense
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
for their valuable time um I'm happy to
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
take any questions um if I'm unable to
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
answer I'm happy to divert them and get
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
K how much time does it would it
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
actually take for you to gather these
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
records to put them on a flash drive to
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
provide them sure um in speaking with
 
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
some of our members um who are who serve
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
as Town clerks they spend at least an
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
hour every day um keeping things up
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
updated in terms of deaths um new voters
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
Etc which seems like a good portion of
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
their time out of each shift every
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
day you followup follow so I'm not
 
00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
asking about maintenance but I'm asking
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
about so they're going to have to do
 
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
that regardless of somebody's getting a
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
copy of it or not they have to keep that
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
updated so how much time would it
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
actually take to actually provide this
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
service because this is the service that
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
we'd be asking them we're not asking
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
people that are requesting a copy of the
 
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
checklist to subsidize the cost of
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
keeping the checklist up to date because
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
they already have to do that anyway so
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
how much time approximately for them to
 
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
actually provide that data onto a flash
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
drive absolutely I as a college student
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
don't know that exact answer but I can
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely find that out for you and
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
email it to you okay that would be great
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
thank you absolutely thank you f the
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%

from Kensington New Hampshire and I
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
speak and supported this bill and the
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
most troubling thing I've heard today is
 
00:39:20.319 --> 00:39:21.550 align:start position:0%
most troubling thing I've heard today is
the

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
cost what's the cost of not doing it
 
00:39:26.589 --> 00:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
let's think about it for a minute where
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
citizens we pay taxes what is the
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
purpose of me paying taxes for what
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
reason do I pay
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
taxes this is part of a
 
00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
service this is a service to the
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
community it's a part of what I pay my
 
00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
taxes for and I just hope that you will
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
I mean even in our constitution Part 30
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know part one part
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
38 we're article 8 we're all supposed to
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
be responsible for open government and
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
allow the citizens
 
00:39:59.230 --> 00:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
how are we going to do that if
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to continue on this fee
 
00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839 align:start position:0%
structure it it really is
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
um I hope you'll support this bill
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
because the citizens are paying taxes
 
00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
for what this is part of what we
 
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
do will you be taking questions
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely are there questions from the
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee okay seeing Oh yes
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative Brenan I apologize thank
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair are you aware of any
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
instances where individuals have
 
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
requested a checklist and then abused
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
the checklist by harassing members of
 
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
the community based on information that
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
they were able to obtain on the
 
00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
checklist I I don't personally but why
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
should that
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
be here's the condition people are going
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
to do things all the time sometimes nice
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes not so nice why punish
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
everybody for people if those those
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
people are acting out of control or not
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
within the bounds that shouldn't be the
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
determination for the rest of us who
 
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
don't act like
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
that further questions seeing none thank
 
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
you I have no other people signed up to
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
speak online there were 46 in support
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
and 17 signed in opposed with that I am
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on HB
 
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
1446 I'll open the public hearing for HB
 
00:41:21.069 --> 00:41:21.079 align:start position:0%
1577 representative Brenan I assume
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
you'll be
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
introducing well you're the first named
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry representative C I
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:55.230 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.950 align:start position:0%
 
then

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
what have you ready representative okay
 
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of
 
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
house election law committee I'm
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative Alvin C of Len serving
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
eight towns in marac County District 26
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
today I'm introducing House Bill
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
1577 an act relative to digital images
 
00:42:17.119 --> 00:42:17.990 align:start position:0%
1577 an act relative to digital images
of

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
ballots this bill is intended to provide
 
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for New Hampshire
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
citizens to check for himself the
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
accuracy of the new digital ballot
 
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.990 align:start position:0%
accuracy of the new digital ballot
tabulating

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
tabulating
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
devices this can be done in a manner
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
that protects the Integrity of the
 
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
original balance and the Machine results
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
so that any discrepancies found can be
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
formally investigated with the original
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
ballots and machine
 
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
data the old ACU vote devices have a
 
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
history of reporting widely differing
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
numbers of overvotes that went on for
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
decades without resolution there were a
 
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
couple of steps that could have been
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
taken to investigate and possibly
 
00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:01.720 align:start position:0%
minimize the apparent vote problem but
 
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
weren't at least we recently got a work
 
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
around to bypass the problem by
 
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
rejecting vot's uh ballots detected to
 
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
have an overvote and have them hand
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
counted this bill provides an
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity for citizens to examine and
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
possibly identify any idiosyncrasies of
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
the new digital ballot counting devices
 
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
may have so the state can get the
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
devices corrected or their use
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
discontinued we need to find and expose
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
any irregularities these in these
 
00:43:35.549 --> 00:43:35.559 align:start position:0%
devices early rather than waiting
 
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
decades until the devices are near the
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
end of useful life we deserve extreme
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
accuracy in accounting of ballots for
 
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.230 align:start position:0%
accuracy in accounting of ballots for
our

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:43:46.549 --> 00:43:46.559 align:start position:0%
elections this bill essentially provides
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
a rather inexpensive way to have some or
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
all of the new electronic ballot
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
counting devices audited albeit
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
unofficially this bill provides a path
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
for an official audit or investigation
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
if the results so
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
weren't for anyone who examines the
 
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
digital images and Compares their
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
observation to the record of how the
 
00:44:10.549 --> 00:44:10.559 align:start position:0%
machine interpreted each vote on the
 
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
ballot the most likely source of
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
discrepancy would be with poorly marked
 
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
ovals by the voter there are
 
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
instructions on the ballot saying to
 
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
fill in the
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
oval but a few voters seem to miss that
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
and only put in a small or lightweight
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
Mark in the ovals which the machine may
 
00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
not detect the devices are designed not
 
00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:33.079 align:start position:0%
to detect smudges or hesitation marks
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
and count them as
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
votes an important thing for an observer
 
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
to look for is discrepancies in how the
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
device totals up the votes detected to
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
see if there are any programming errors
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
or symptoms of tampering this may be
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
reported in a formal investigation made
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state will supervise
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
this process schedule access for The
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
Observers and provide for the protection
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
of the original election data since this
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
is an
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
unofficial uh procedure it will need to
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
wait until after the recount period is
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh to avoid distractions during that
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
time however the secretary May order an
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
examination of digital images under his
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
supervision to be done in conjunction
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
with a recount or audit if conditions
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
wen't thank you and I'm happy to answer
 
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have questions
 
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative Brennan thank
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of how much time
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
this would take a Municipal Employee to
 
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
supervise a member of the public wanting
 
00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.950 align:start position:0%
supervise a member of the public wanting
to

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
view these ballots thank you for the
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
question as it's as this bill
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
um says it would be through the
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to do this so it
 
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
would not be a Municipal issue my
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
apologies I should have said Secretary
 
00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:05.079 align:start position:0%
of State's office and an employe of the
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
state would
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
be supervising this I don't know and the
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
secretary is here and I think he'll be
 
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
able to better answer that question for
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
you and he is up next so uh seeing no
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
other questions thank you representative
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
C the one and only secretary
 
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:30.230 align:start position:0%
C the one and only secretary
scanland

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
committee once again I'm David scanland
 
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State um here to just
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
provide information to the committee on
 
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
this bill um there there are three
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
really important tenants in conducting
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
an election first that voters be able to
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
cast their votes uh uh privately on a
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
ballot and that and that they're their
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
vote remains Anonymous it's secret
 
00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:02.559 align:start position:0%
number two is that there be a
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
process uh after the election that
 
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
involves recounts and appeals and things
 
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
like that that affirm the results and
 
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
give the voters confidence that there
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
was a a good Fair accurate
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
election and then the third part of that
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
is that once that is done there is
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
finality to the election process that
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know the result are what they were
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
and uh they're behind us and and we move
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
forward and what representative C has
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
proposed deals with that middle tenant
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
of making sure that uh we can have
 
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
confidence in uh the election
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
results and I believe strongly that you
 
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
know that process has to be as
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
transparent uh as we can make it and his
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
proposal uh is timely maybe a little bit
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
premature sure uh because we are on the
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
verge now of going to a new uh uh
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
generation of ballot counting devices
 
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
which use digital scan technology where
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
the actual image of the ballot can be uh
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
recorded uh and is available for uh
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
confirming the results of an election
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's through a really rigid or
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
aggressive uh audit process or whether
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
we open it up to let citizens have the
 
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to view those ballots for a
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
period of time and I think that that is
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
going to take a little time to determine
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
how that is going to play out
 
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
um from my perspective you know our
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
focus is on getting these new devices in
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
place so that uh they replace the the
 
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
very rapidly aging ACU vote machines
 
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
that are out there
 
00:48:58.510 --> 00:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh I think we need to be looking at what
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
the audit uh process is going to look
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
like uh and then and then once we
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
complete that Focus you know how much
 
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:10.839 align:start position:0%
how much broader is the public
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity going to be to view the
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
Ballance so uh I I think that uh
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative C is off to a good start
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
I think some of the provisions in the
 
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
bill need a lot of refinement before
 
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
they could be implemented and I'm
 
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to work with
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative C and and the committee
 
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
on on doing
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
that be happy to answer any questions
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Brennan
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have any concerns um
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
about the portion of this bill that
 
00:49:44.829 --> 00:49:44.839 align:start position:0%
would make ballots public record rather
 
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
than um exempt from
 
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
91a Yes um there have have on a regular
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
basis been attempts to exempt the actual
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
ballots from uh 91a and the position
 
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
that I have taken in the past is that uh
 
00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
keeping the ballots private protects the
 
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
secret vote of the
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
voters um it uh there is a pretty uh
 
00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:22.839 align:start position:0%
uh uh there is an easy opportunity to re
 
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
request recounts uh so that there is an
 
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to view the ballots uh there
 
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
are appeal processes to the to the
 
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:31.950 align:start position:0%
are appeal processes to the to the
recount

00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
recount
 
00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.190 align:start position:0%
recount
process

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
um because of that I think that you know
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
there should be a formal organized uh
 
00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:41.510 align:start position:0%
there should be a formal organized uh
and

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
carefully uh um administered opportunity
 
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
for voters to see the ballots if they
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
want to but again at some point there
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be finality to the election and
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
that you know know the results are what
 
00:50:59.549 --> 00:50:59.559 align:start position:0%
they are and then we move forward and
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
look at the next
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
B thank you chairman I got a question
 
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
line 21 where it
 
00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.510 align:start position:0%
line 21 where it
says

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.190 align:start position:0%
says
or

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
um yeah what is the word I'm talking
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
about uh handwriting shall be exempt
 
00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:31.160 align:start position:0%
from RSA 91a should be public record
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
would that then really do away with that
 
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
it's a secret ballot if handwriting can
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
be anal analyzed for a mailin ballot
 
00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
well it could I I have seen and this
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen often but I have seen
 
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
where voters sign their ballot you know
 
00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:53.559 align:start position:0%
they feel strongly about their vote um
 
00:51:56.789 --> 00:51:56.799 align:start position:0%
and the um
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
there are ways um which I think of the
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
best way to say this prior to the early
 
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
1890s vote buying was a real problem in
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
this country
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
and and the secret ballot solved that
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
problem it it just eliminated it on the
 
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
spot to the extent that you allow
 
00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
ballots to be viewed after the election
 
00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
you create an opportunity for that uh
 
00:52:28.589 --> 00:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
type of voter fraud to resurface and it
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
could be as simple as saying you know I
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
will pay you
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
$50 if you vote for this person for
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
president and the way I know it's going
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
to be your ballot is if on the you know
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
the the the last race on the ballot you
 
00:52:44.589 --> 00:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
write in Daniel
 
00:52:44.599 --> 00:52:46.109 align:start position:0%
write in Daniel
Webster

00:52:46.109 --> 00:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
Webster
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
um so you know there are potential fraud
 
00:52:52.109 --> 00:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
opportunities that go along with making
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
says to that point do we allow people to
 
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:07.309 align:start position:0%
 
recounts

00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
recounts
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
uh yes I don't think there's anything to
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
prevent that from happening thank
 
00:53:16.349 --> 00:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
you all right oh representative BR with
 
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
a followup please thank you so am I
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
understanding your testimony correctly
 
00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
three quick the three points that you
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
were making earlier this bill
 
00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:29.559 align:start position:0%
essentially violates all three of those
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
points no no I think that what what
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative C is proposing here
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity for giving the public
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
greater confidence in the election
 
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:45.799 align:start position:0%
process by being more
 
00:53:48.789 --> 00:53:48.799 align:start position:0%
transparent I I think that you know we
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
have a a generous ability to request
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
recounts where every ballot is viewed
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
everybody that's observing can see how
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
those ballots are being counted um and I
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
think that that part of this legislation
 
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
is an extension of that it allows people
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
to look at ballots and you know give
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
some confidence that uh you know the
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
election was fair and
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
accurate representative
 
00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:22.589 align:start position:0%
accurate representative
we

00:54:22.589 --> 00:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um just with respect to the
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
and the availability of the two machines
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
approved by the ballot law commission do
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
you know or could you remind me when
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
those will be available and procurement
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
and uh purchasing Logistics aside when
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
would those be available to New
 
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so what I know at this point
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
in time is that both there were two
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
devices that were conditionally
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
approved uh a a device by a company
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
called voting Works which is a small
 
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
company but they use open- Source
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
software so the code is nonproprietary
 
00:55:07.789 --> 00:55:07.799 align:start position:0%
and then the other device that was
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
approved was a device that's
 
00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
manufactured by
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
Dominion um and marketed through the
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
local vendor that currently provides the
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
acuo they do a great job maintaining the
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
machines and their service is
 
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
good the uh voting
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
Works company came to us with their plan
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
to meet the conditional approval which
 
00:55:34.109 --> 00:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
is go to a nationally certified
 
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
laboratory to make sure that certain
 
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
components of the machine will operate
 
00:55:42.029 --> 00:55:42.039 align:start position:0%
and and that they're secure and it looks
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
like they are on track to have four or
 
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
five devices uh in four or five towns
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
available for the March toown
 
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
meeting uh and if that's successful then
 
00:55:56.589 --> 00:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
there'll be more readily available uh
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
for the fall
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
elections Dominion threw us a bit of a
 
00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
curveball uh because uh New Hampshire is
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
a very small and I mean a very small
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
Market to a company that size and at
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
this point it does not seem that they
 
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
are willing to take their product to an
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
as certified laboratory just to
 
00:56:25.029 --> 00:56:25.039 align:start position:0%
satisfy the certification requirement
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
ments of little old New Hampshire what
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
they intend to do what they want to do
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
is take their whole Suite of products
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
many of which don't apply to New
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but you know have a national
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
market and submit them all at the same
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
time so I could not tell you at the
 
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
moment when uh the Dominion is going to
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
have when they're going to meet the the
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know the
 
00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
certification conditional requirements
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
for the state it may not be until after
 
00:56:59.309 --> 00:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:01.240 align:start position:0%
elections voting works is doing it
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
though right voting works is still there
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
and and and and what was my favorite do
 
00:57:04.839 --> 00:57:05.750 align:start position:0%
and and and and what was my favorite do
you

00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
remember I don't I don't remember which
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
it was Voting Works representative weie
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so so ostensibly voting works is
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
available and for those towns and wards
 
00:57:22.829 --> 00:57:22.839 align:start position:0%
that choose to use that
 
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
machine that would be
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
it would be feasible for this bill um
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
all changes aside um if it should be
 
00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:37.799 align:start position:0%
approved um to use that you know as soon
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
as um scanning devices are available um
 
00:57:42.839 --> 00:57:44.829 align:start position:0%
as um scanning devices are available um
but

00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh still waiting on those communities
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
that might prefer a Dominion machine or
 
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
something like that is that
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
approximately correct yes this bill
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.270 align:start position:0%
 
technology

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:04.839 align:start position:0%
okay res raer thank you thanks for
 
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned that at
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
some point elections need to be final
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
what kind of a time period was would you
 
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
suggest for access to these images after
 
00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.309 align:start position:0%
suggest for access to these images after
an

00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.119 --> 00:58:28.069 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
estimated cost for the labor that would
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
be required of the Secretary of State's
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
office to
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
oversee individuals who are requesting
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
these digital images before you answer
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
that I accidentally turned your mic off
 
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
convenient I I I don't don't uh I
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned in when I first made my
 
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
remarks that parts of this bill needs
 
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
some significant refinement and and I
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
think it would be that refinement that
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
would determine what the actual cost
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
would end up
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
being okay thank you uh I have one final
 
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
question it's
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
philosophical um doesn't really pertain
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
too much to this bill so we had five
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
people vote in dixville Notch they all
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
voted for the same candidate we all know
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
how they voted did they have a secret
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
ballot six sorry six do they do they
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
have a secret
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
ballot philosophical
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
yeah thank
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
you and that's right in case you're
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
wondering what goes through my brain
 
00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:43.640 align:start position:0%
that's what goes through my brain does
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
make any noise we're in recess for two
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:53.640 --> 01:00:23.549 align:start position:0%
 
11

01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
not

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.520 --> 01:01:37.190 align:start position:0%
 
Rec

01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay it's 11 o'clock we're going to come
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
out of recess uh I forgot to read in um
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
on hb1 1577 we had three signed in
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
online for support 30 opposed and three
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
neutral um so with that we'll close the
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 577 and we
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
will open up the public hearing on House
 
01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 1705 relative to classifying
 
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
ballots as public information
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative mcarter you are
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
recognized to introduce the bill welcome
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
law thank you chairman uh pardon me I've
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
gotten over a sinus infection this
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
weekend and it's still hanging on just a
 
01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:22.839 align:start position:0%
little bit um Nicki mcarter
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
representative from Belmont representing
 
01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:30.039 align:start position:0%
belnap uh District 8 and I submitted uh
 
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
HB 1705 on behalf of many constituents
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
reaching out to
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
me um just expressing their frustration
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
with the fact that ballots are um
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
excluded from 91a and worked with a
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
couple of different people and some
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
legislators on Crafting the language for
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
this bill uh which is what you have
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
before you right now
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh I just want to say a few things if
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
you are familiar with the case Miranda v
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
Arizona the Supreme Court stated where
 
01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
rights are secured by the Constitution
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
there can be no Ru making or legislation
 
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
that would abrogate them so to exempt
 
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
ballots from a 91a statute I would
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
suspect sounds like the Supreme Court is
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
saying you can't do that that's
 
01:03:26.029 --> 01:03:26.039 align:start position:0%
understanding of that they they should
 
01:03:29.269 --> 01:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
be public records like everything else
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
um with the appropriate um means to
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
request uh that information as we all
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
know we just all voted on last Tuesday
 
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh ballots are Anonymous you don't know
 
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
who cast which ballot unless you are
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
from dicksville Notch um as we've just
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
discussed uh so I wouldn't think there
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
would be any privacy concerns with um
 
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
creating a method or means in which the
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
the ballots can be accessed through
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
public records requests uh for the
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
purpose of Citizen audits or um what
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
other other kind of queries that
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
somebody may be looking to do for
 
01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
statistical research or what have you to
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh try to raise the confidence of the
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
voting populace that the results
 
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
published are the actual results that
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
were cast and I think we still have a
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
lot of work to do in that space getting
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
the public to
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
um to accept that our elections are safe
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
and secure and free and fair and that's
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
why I submitted this bill okay questions
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:04:40.829 --> 01:04:40.839 align:start position:0%
committee I will take question see none
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
I guess we'll oh never mind
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
representative qu is not going to let
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
you off the hook that easy thank you Mr
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative I
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
may not be able to answer I'll give it a
 
01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:50.839 align:start position:0%
try I understand that it's long been my
 
01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
policy if I don't know I say so and
 
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
that's a correct answer uh but thank you
 
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question sure uh in
 
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
reviewing the bill uh it states that uh
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
ballots would no longer be exempt from a
 
01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
a right to no
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
request uh that seems to imply to me
 
01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
that that would be a requirement to
 
01:05:14.589 --> 01:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
comply with all right to know request
 
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
from anybody any member of the public to
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
see ballots okay uh on page one line 6
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
through 8 directly following uh
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
section it uh specifies a procedure for
 
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State to follow to have
 
01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:32.309 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State to follow to have
viewing

01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
viewing
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities but I I couldn't see there
 
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
where it says that's the exclusive
 
01:05:40.829 --> 01:05:40.839 align:start position:0%
procedure for the public to view ballots
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
so I wonder if there's
 
01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
a a contradiction there I mean it seems
 
01:05:47.789 --> 01:05:47.799 align:start position:0%
to imply that it would still be possible
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
for anybody to request
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
ballots under a right to no
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
request I suppose there's room there to
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
to make some uh adjustments or some
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
amended language to tighten that up a
 
01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
bit and I'd be happy to to to look at
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
that and do that as soon as possible
 
01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you welcome uh Mr chairman
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
can I have a followup uh you know what
 
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
just for you yes oh thank you Mr
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
chairman for that
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
courtesy uh
 
01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
on lines 8 through
 
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
n it
 
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
uh the bill says uh
 
01:06:28.029 --> 01:06:28.039 align:start position:0%
hang on a second every town in
 
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
Ward uh shall save scanned images of all
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
ballots cast in an election that seems
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
to imply a requirement that all towns
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
including those that do hand counting of
 
01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:40.990 align:start position:0%
including those that do hand counting of
paper

01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
paper
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
ballots uh without a machine would then
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
have to scan ballots to comply with with
 
01:06:50.269 --> 01:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
this uh portion of the the
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
bill I'm I'm thinking the intent here
 
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
to facilitate ease in storage of this
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
information instead of having thousands
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
of boxes of ballots that someone's going
 
01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:05.799 align:start position:0%
to have to Paw through now perhaps it's
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
easy it's as uh as simple as creating
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
electronic format uh to fulfill an
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
information request from a particular
 
01:07:16.589 --> 01:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
Ward or uh
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
town and yeah I guess it would it would
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
mean that the towns that hand count
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
would need to have um high-speed
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
scanners to be able to generate those
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
types of images okay thank you for
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
answering my question and thank you
 
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
again Mr chairman representative wood
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh Mr chairman and thank
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
you for take my question the um actually
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
he asked the question I was going to ask
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
but I just was thinking that maybe you
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
did when you're doing the research do
 
01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:47.079 align:start position:0%
you know why and when this exemption was
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
ma made uh to 91a I mean it it it seems
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
odd to me I have to look at the history
 
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
but do you know I do not know um I'm I'm
 
01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:57.799 align:start position:0%
sorry I I read through this again this
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
morning and thought to myself self you
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
should know the answer to this question
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
because someone's going to ask that and
 
01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:05.799 align:start position:0%
I did not look it up so I do not know
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
well I'll look it up for you when we get
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
the get the debate thank you thank you
 
01:08:09.599 --> 01:08:10.589 align:start position:0%
the get the debate thank you thank you
represent

01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:15.160 align:start position:0%
Burnham thank you Mr chairman um uh I'm
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand the process so
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
the calendar um to to view paper ballots
 
01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
is set by the Secretary of State's
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
office current correct correct but the
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
viewing is taking place at the town or
 
01:08:28.679 --> 01:08:30.430 align:start position:0%
viewing is taking place at the town or
city

01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
city
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
location um I think that's the intent of
 
01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
the bill so that someone doesn't have to
 
01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
drive from say Co Brook to the Secretary
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
of State's office or state archives or
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
you know wherever wherever this ends up
 
01:08:44.829 --> 01:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
being and I think that's that's a
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
logistical um thing that we as the
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
legislature should work to uh accomplish
 
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
okay um making public records accessible
 
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
to to the public they're their documents
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
part one article 8 says that um I think
 
01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
it's our job as the legislature to try
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
to make that uh logistically feasible
 
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
and not um outlandishly either expensive
 
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
or inconvenient for the
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
public so perhaps yes okay followup
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
question just a second as a answer to
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
representative Wood's question our
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
wonderful as representative Aken
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
Arenberg pointed out to me our wonderful
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
committee researcher has prepared
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
there's a full memo on why ballots were
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
Exempted from
 
01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
91a um including relevant case law um
 
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
and represent M if you'd like my copy of
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
it you're more than welcome to it uh
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
because I have it electronically I have
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
it electronically I'm
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
sure you follow from representative
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
barnham yes so um that would definitely
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
create a different um situation in the
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
towns and cities for their viewing my
 
01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is that a public viewing
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
or or is it private viewing I just I'm
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
trying to understand it in in my town
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
like how that would work um if they're
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
don't if they're not scanning or don't
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
have access to scanning ballots at this
 
01:10:08.669 --> 01:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
time I'd also think that that is again
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
something us as the legislature can work
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
to uh resolve that if a town uh hand
 
01:10:18.189 --> 01:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
counts and they don't have the scanning
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
devices the high-speed scanners perhaps
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
there's one or two or several from the
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State office that get
 
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
dispatched to those communities so that
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
they can scan their ballots and the
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
towns that have access to them don't
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
need that resource I I'm not really
 
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
certain at this time how how the
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
logistics would work okay thank
 
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
you represent rter thank you thanks for
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question um this bill proposes
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
that the images are available within 48
 
01:10:47.709 --> 01:10:47.719 align:start position:0%
hours after the close of an election I
 
01:10:51.149 --> 01:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
think 1577 that we just reviewed said
 
01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
after recounts so the 48 hours certainly
 
01:10:58.110 --> 01:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
before any recounts um would you want to
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
I think there's room there to amend that
 
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you further questions from the
 
01:11:07.149 --> 01:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing none thank you so much
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
next thank you Mr chairman members of
 
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm David scanland
 
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State I hear in opposition
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
to this bill and I'm not going to repeat
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
the testimony that that I gave earlier
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
um I think this falls in the same
 
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
category as uh trying to be as
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
transparent as possible between you know
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
the voter casting their secret ballot
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
and the finality to election I think
 
01:11:43.629 --> 01:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
there's a strong desire to
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
see uh
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh efforts made whether it's through
 
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
audits or the ability to to a formal
 
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
ability to view ballots uh just to
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
instill that confidence that the
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
election was fair and accurate um th
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
this bill uh has some significant issues
 
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
with it I think they've already been
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned through questions of the
 
01:12:06.159 --> 01:12:07.669 align:start position:0%
mentioned through questions of the
committee

01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
um first uh I don't think that it is a
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
good idea that we give the public the
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to handle uh the actual
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
paper ballots that is the official
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
record of the election and and that has
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
to be kept safe and secure and after the
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
election is over those ballots are
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
sealed and the only time that they are
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
opened up is if there's a recount that's
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
requested or if a court orders them
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
opened up because somebody brought a
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
strong case forward that you know we
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
need to take a closer look otherwise
 
01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
they're sealed they're kept for 22
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
months for State uh or federal election
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
and then they can be
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
destroyed the history of the 91a
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
issue uh ballots have never been subject
 
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
to being opened up and reviewed after
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
the election is over and after the seals
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
have been placed on them except for a
 
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
recount or court
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
order it it became an issue uh in the
 
01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:16.950 align:start position:0%
order it it became an issue uh in the
early

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
early
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
2000s when there were some academic
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
groups this is my recollection that were
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
asking if they could review the
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
ballots uh prior to their destruction
 
01:13:31.629 --> 01:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
after the retention period was over for
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
holding them and the the uh the statute
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
uh making them subject not subject
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
exempt from 91a came about as a result
 
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
of that just to make sure that everybody
 
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
understood that you know that once the
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
election was over uh the ballots were
 
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
still to be kept private
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
um and the issue of making the images
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
of scan copies of the ballots available
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
in a format that is easily acceptable
 
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
accessible by the public within 48 Hours
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
of the election you know I suppose if
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
you threw enough money at it it could
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
happen but uh that would be a very
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
challenging uh thing to do so with that
 
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to try and answer any
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the committee
 
01:14:26.669 --> 01:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you secretary scalin
 
01:14:26.679 --> 01:14:27.590 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you secretary scalin
Al

01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
Al
 
01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
brandano y oh withdrawn easy enough um
 
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
and last up natch gra from the New
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal
 
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
Association thank you Mr chair n gra for
 
01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association I second
 
01:14:43.470 --> 01:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
everything that secretary scanland has
 
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
already said today um we did our best in
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note uh to provide
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
information to LBA so that they could
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
calculate the approximate cost um we we
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
assumed that if we were to scan um
 
01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
require that all ballots be scanned
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
within 48 hours that would require
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
highspeed scanners similar to the
 
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
scanner purchased by the secretary's
 
01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:06.990 align:start position:0%
scanner purchased by the secretary's
office

01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
um in response to some legislation
 
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
passed uh for the election audits um I
 
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
believe the secretary had reported at
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
that time in a fiscal note that it was
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
about $40,000 for that scanner so when
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
we when we did the math we came up with
 
01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh 9.3 6 million spread out over um all
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
cities and towns um so we do oppose this
 
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
legislation if I didn't say that in in
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
the first place um as the secretary said
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
we have a very robust system for how uh
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
how our elections are processed as you
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
were all very familiar we're very
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
confident in that system and we look
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
forward to working with the committee
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
and the secretary's office to continue
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
to improve that system and we don't
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
believe this is this legislation would
 
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
be necessary or assist us and in uh
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
receiving accurate results happy to take
 
01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
any questions questions from the
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.229 align:start position:0%
committee represent
we

01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony so the
 
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
9.36 million 40,000 scanners times
 
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
234 municipalities so it's the
 
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
assumption is that it cannot be shared
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
under any circumstances between
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities or you know from a
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
centralized unit coming from the
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office or something
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
like that that was our assumption given
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
the volume of of voting um given that
 
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
you know obviously there's some small
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
cities and towns but there's no
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
provision now for you know a town clerk
 
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
after they've sealed the ballots to
 
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
bring those to another municipality
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
unseal them scan them and then bring
 
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
them to where they need to go um that
 
01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
would require additional legislation so
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
we assume that each municipality would
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
have to do this scanning on their
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
own follow yeah so I um I may be
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
remembering this number incorrectly but
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
I understand there are 135 communities
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
or so so forth right now that are
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
currently hand counting so the rest are
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh using the old machines and are doing
 
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
those and correct those machines will
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
eventually have to be replaced I'm
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
assuming that those communities will
 
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
probably not Veer toward Bo hand
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
counting having established the machine
 
01:17:30.189 --> 01:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
usage already um with those as
 
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
assumptions do you think this 234
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
municipality number is still
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
correct um if there's only 135 hand
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
counting communities so there are 234
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities I don't anticipate that
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
changing um I don't know obviously it's
 
01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
a local option so whether hand count or
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
not I don't know how that might adjust
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
um my understanding and I defer
 
01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
completely to the Secretary of State
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
here is that
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
um the new machines that have that have
 
01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
been going through the approval process
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
would not automatically save digital
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
copies of those and even if they did
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
you'd still have those ballots that
 
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
somebody under voted or over voted which
 
01:18:18.189 --> 01:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
legislation I believe last year
 
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
clarified those are basically kicked out
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
from the machine put into the
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
the third pocket side pocket there so
 
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
you'd have a whole kind of little stack
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
of B ballots that wouldn't have gone
 
01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
through the machine you have to somehow
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
account for those and account for those
 
01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
votes um and obviously if we continue to
 
01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
go with the intent of the voter if you
 
01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
have something like an eraser Mark or
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
something like that um you know you have
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to get that scanned in
 
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
into the system so that you have a
 
01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
accurate number of digital ballots and
 
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
you don't have kind of multiple piles of
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
ballots from one jurisdiction so I
 
01:18:59.709 --> 01:18:59.719 align:start position:0%
assume what you would do is get kind of
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
a uh a high-speed scanner like the
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
secretary's office has that can digitize
 
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
all ballots regardless of how voters
 
01:19:08.189 --> 01:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
marked them so that that could be
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
reviewed completely within that 48 hour
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
timeline thank you thank you further
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you um there
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
are no one else signed up to speak in
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
person and my computer just shut so I
 
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
can't all right and so we had 36 people
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
signed in online in Support 32 signed in
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
online as opposed and two signed in
 
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
online as neutral with that I am closing
 
01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on HB 1705 the
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
committee will stand in recess until
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:31:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay it's officially
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%

01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
is just asking the towns and the cities
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
to put it in a format that's sortable I
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
come from Manchester there a population
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
of 120,000 people we get our voter list
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's an alphabetical form and you can't
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
sorted so for instance when I want to go
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
out door knocking or politicking I want
 
01:32:30.030 --> 01:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
to sort it by the street talk to
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
everybody on that street I can't do it
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
I'd have to bring my whole thing with me
 
01:32:36.990 --> 01:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
and go by name so that's basically all
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
I'm asking to do it's pretty
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
straightforward I
 
01:32:42.189 --> 01:32:42.199 align:start position:0%
think okay well you needed five you you
 
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
took five minutes you have anything else
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
you want to for the next four minutes 45
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
seconds or sure if any questions I don't
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
know I'm usually pretty straight into
 
01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
the point so I mean that's are there
 
01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
questions to representative Howard
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh earlier today we
 
01:32:58.350 --> 01:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
heard a similar Bill uh in which the
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State testified that uh
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
electronic copies sent by email may be
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to send and that the word
 
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
shall uh may be difficult language would
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
you be acceptable to changing that sh to
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
a May
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
sure thank you drives a hard bargain
 
01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.149 align:start position:0%
sure thank you drives a hard bargain
representative

01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
Burnham thank you Mr chair so my
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
understanding with this bill though this
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
is coming from the municipalities
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
correct correct only to the candidates
 
01:33:31.709 --> 01:33:31.719 align:start position:0%
correct yep okay so then uh then that is
 
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
a possibility that it can be sent by
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
email I believe that's the way
 
01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester collects the information now
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
is it's in a database everything you
 
01:33:41.229 --> 01:33:41.239 align:start position:0%
take your driver's license and they just
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
scan you in now I mean that information
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
is already there I just want it to be
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
put in a format that's usable for us
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
right and I think everyone here can
 
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
agree that they probably wanted a format
 
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
that they can use when they're out doing
 
01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:53.149 align:start position:0%
that they can use when they're out doing
their

01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
campaigning you know it's probably one
 
01:33:56.910 --> 01:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
of the most bipartisan things I could
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
think of when I did this
 
01:34:01.109 --> 01:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
so yet you put me on the bill which is a
 
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
so anyone else have any questions
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
represent oh uh representative Mirad
 
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
would like to give us his
 
01:34:14.669 --> 01:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
knowledge I I would yeah I'm going
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
withhold I don't have much but I just a
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
quick question you said electronic copy
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
but you want a usable form do you want
 
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
it like an in a spread sheet would it
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
like would would an electronic PDF
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
file uh that wouldn't satisfy satisfy
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
you so it needs to this bill needs to
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
say more than sortable okay it says
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
sortable in the bill and that's exactly
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
what I'm kind of getting at as a
 
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet or some kind of sortable
 
01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
file further questions are you happy
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
with your
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors I am very happy Ross gave me
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
some tips on it we uh cleaned it up a
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
little bit before we uh presented it to
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
you guys so representative weary uh yes
 
01:34:54.510 --> 01:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh just a quick uh
 
01:35:00.109 --> 01:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
clarification is this intended it says
 
01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
in towns and cities so when the
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State testified earlier he
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
was talking about
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide um and the necessity or the
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
unlikelihood that such uh large list
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
could be sent by email but but for towns
 
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
and cities you're really talking about a
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
much smaller list then not a Statewide
 
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
120,000 people on a spreadsheet really
 
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
is not a big spreadsheet it's not not a
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
big deal so okay thank you very much
 
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:32.910 align:start position:0%

question uh I note that on in the bill
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
itself it says the supervisors shall
 
01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:48.360 align:start position:0%

access to voter checklist by
 
01:35:58.830 --> 01:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
candidates it's just a I'm just curious
 
01:36:01.950 --> 01:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
difference thank
 
01:36:06.669 --> 01:36:06.679 align:start position:0%
you it's a something we'll have to
 
01:36:09.790 --> 01:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
resolve I imagine I guess so yeah lines
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
OSS makes the titles line seven and
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
eight yes because I I I have asked for
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
for my bills to be titled the best bill
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%

Susan portelli Rockingham District 19
 
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
Hampton Falls and Kensington thank you
 
01:37:08.910 --> 01:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
again for letting me testify here this
 
01:37:10.990 --> 01:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
bill is similar to the one we heard
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
early this morning this morning but the
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
arguments are still very important
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
having access to this data is absolutely
 
01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
critical to make sure sure that we
 
01:37:25.629 --> 01:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
maintain our citizen legislature and be
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
able to access our first amendment by
 
01:37:31.709 --> 01:37:31.719 align:start position:0%
getting out our message to our voters
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
and this simply States just send us the
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
data in some type of format where we can
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
sort it evaluate it and um use the data
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
very effectively in a very coste
 
01:37:49.229 --> 01:37:49.239 align:start position:0%
effective way by eliminating this fee I
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
believe strongly it will encourage
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
enourage additional participation I
 
01:37:57.390 --> 01:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's a burden at all to
 
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
send this data if absolutely
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
necessary the email could be sent in uh
 
01:38:06.109 --> 01:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
you could break up the format and send
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
multiple emails this happens all the
 
01:38:12.189 --> 01:38:12.199 align:start position:0%
time we have other committees that have
 
01:38:15.550 --> 01:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
um a lot of data that's transmitted by
 
01:38:17.709 --> 01:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
our town representatives for example our
 
01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
planning board some of the documents are
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
huge and they just send it in multiple
 
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
emails and I don't believe that this
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
would be honorous to our town clerks and
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
I think it is a very specious argument
 
01:38:33.629 --> 01:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
to say that people will be requesting
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
this data every day or every hour I have
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
not found that to be the case I think
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
that people that we want this data are
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
very serious about making their message
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
heard and I believe this is a very
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort and it will benefit
 
01:38:51.119 --> 01:38:52.149 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort and it will benefit
benit

01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
benit
 
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
everyone that is interested in democracy
 
01:38:58.270 --> 01:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
and making sure they have the ability to
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
reach their voters so I respectfully ask
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill o OTP 20
 
01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.159 align:start position:0%
20 uh questions from the committee
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
representative Bay thank you Mr chair
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh to
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
your comment about no one will ask this
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
data every day I don't believe so so uh
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
would you be open for saying that uh
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
limiting the request let's say every
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
election cycle or candidate can request
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
make this
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
request perhaps we can let the town
 
01:39:39.790 --> 01:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
clerk determine if there is someone that
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
is abusing the request perhaps we can
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
put some type of language in there but I
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
really believe that access to this data
 
01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
is very important and I'm sure that our
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
town clerks can monitor that to see if
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
there is anyone that is abusing it and
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
um perhaps you know referring them to
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of
 
01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
State followup um do you find any reason
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
for a candidate to uh request this data
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
cycle and and again I believe that
 
01:40:23.109 --> 01:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
access to the data is the important
 
01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
issue and not the frequency which I do
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
believe will probably be every election
 
01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
cycle but if there are some updates or
 
01:40:35.589 --> 01:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
there's a specific reason I would really
 
01:40:38.189 --> 01:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
hate to limit that in but I would hate
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
to limit that by law and I believe
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
people are very reasonable and they will
 
01:40:45.589 --> 01:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a benefit to
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
them and that they won't abuse this
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
privilege but it is public data and
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
we're just
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
the bill is just saying make it in a
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
format that will comport with where we
 
01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
are today and how we communicate today
 
01:41:02.109 --> 01:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
and I wish that we still had the Town
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
Square and you we made great speeches
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
and everyone came to the public common
 
01:41:09.149 --> 01:41:09.159 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately we're in the
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
electronic age and we really need to
 
01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're accommodating that
 
01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative BR thank you
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question are
 
01:41:21.589 --> 01:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
you aware of
 
01:41:24.669 --> 01:41:24.679 align:start position:0%
instances where community members
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
individuals are requesting information
 
01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:27.750 align:start position:0%
individuals are requesting information
from

01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities and abusing that
 
01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
information such like the checklist or
 
01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
you know 91a
 
01:41:39.229 --> 01:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
requests I worked with my town clerk I'm
 
01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
gonna pause real fast can can you define
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
means um there are instances throughout
 
01:41:50.109 --> 01:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where people are
 
01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
submitting voluminous requests uh that
 
01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:54.149 align:start position:0%
submitting voluminous requests uh that
is

01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
overburdening the municipalities and the
 
01:42:00.430 --> 01:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
town clerks and town employees uh so
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
that might be one form of abuse and then
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
another form of abuse might be
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
requesting the voter checklist and using
 
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:11.719 align:start position:0%
that voter checklist to Target specific
 
01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
individuals based on the information
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
found on that checklist um Target them
 
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
for harassment and such it is something
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
that is happening and so that is the
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
basis for my question are you aware that
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
these things are happening in
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities and affecting communities
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
and individuals who are subject to this
 
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
type of abuse of public records well the
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
right to no law is something totally
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
separate so it has nothing to do with
 
01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
this request and I don't believe that
 
01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of documented cases
 
01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
because the information is public you
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
could walk into your town hall and look
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
at the information so it is totally
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
public this will not change that in any
 
01:43:04.270 --> 01:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
way it's just making it available in a
 
01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
sortable format so my town clerk in
 
01:43:12.589 --> 01:43:12.599 align:start position:0%
correspondence with other Town clerks in
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
the area have absolutely not had any
 
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
instances of abuse or uh undue requests
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact we want to encourage
 
01:43:27.790 --> 01:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
public participation and make sure that
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
we're making it easier for small
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
communities large
 
01:43:34.589 --> 01:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
communities to
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
have their um public officials be able
 
01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
to communicate a message or their budget
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
committees or their Schoolboard
 
01:43:46.589 --> 01:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
committees and increasing information is
 
01:43:48.669 --> 01:43:48.679 align:start position:0%
something that we're very proud of here
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee okay hearing none thank you um
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%

01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:45.000 align:start position:0%

dispense with election law and then I'm
 
01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:47.360 align:start position:0%

the sorting and Counting of ballots any
 
03:03:25.150 --> 03:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
machine which replaces humans in the
 
03:03:27.469 --> 03:03:27.479 align:start position:0%
sort and count is an automatic
 
03:03:29.389 --> 03:03:29.399 align:start position:0%
interruption in the human eyewitness
 
03:03:32.070 --> 03:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
chain of custody prescribed for in the

front of you we have an amended version
 
03:03:54.110 --> 03:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
um that was drafted by the original
 
03:03:56.190 --> 03:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
author I was not the original author but
 
03:03:59.110 --> 03:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
that man is here today and we have uh an
 
03:04:00.510 --> 03:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
amended version that we'd like to
 
03:04:02.269 --> 03:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
provide to you when it's her turn to
 
03:04:05.229 --> 03:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
speak and we will submit that to OSS if
 
03:04:07.870 --> 03:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
that's uh o okay to do that copies of it
 
03:04:09.950 --> 03:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
now yes let's just distribute it now I
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
think I don't but when he gets up to
 
03:04:14.910 --> 03:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
speak he has it okay all right so I'll
 
03:04:17.950 --> 03:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
defer to Mark uh Rosetti as the author
 
03:04:19.790 --> 03:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
of the bill I submitted on his behalf I
 
03:04:21.990 --> 03:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
merely acted as the conduit for the
 
03:04:23.510 --> 03:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
information that's totally fine we'll
 
03:04:25.150 --> 03:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
direct our questions
 
03:04:27.550 --> 03:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
to Mark there it
 
03:04:30.510 --> 03:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
is good thank you that's all set I I do
 
03:04:32.269 --> 03:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
that all the time it's my favorite thing
 
03:04:33.750 --> 03:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
to introduce the bill and say no
 
03:04:36.389 --> 03:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
questions aios
 
03:04:39.389 --> 03:04:39.399 align:start position:0%
no Mr edti do you have your proposed
 
03:04:41.550 --> 03:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
amendment I do if you want to distribute
 
03:04:43.830 --> 03:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
it to the committee before we start it's
 
03:04:47.429 --> 03:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
it's a courtesy um we tend to act in
 
03:04:49.550 --> 03:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
good faith here so if this is what you I
 
03:04:52.870 --> 03:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
totally get we don't always make the
 
03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
deadline I got my own thing to
 
03:04:57.790 --> 03:04:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:01.229 --> 03:05:01.239 align:start position:0%
so there are two pages underneath of
 
03:05:01.239 --> 03:05:03.269 align:start position:0%
so there are two pages underneath of
each

03:05:03.269 --> 03:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
each
 
03:05:07.150 --> 03:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
one and I think I counted 13 people
 
03:05:12.269 --> 03:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:12.279 --> 03:05:31.469 align:start position:0%
 
those

03:05:31.469 --> 03:05:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:31.479 --> 03:05:34.030 align:start position:0%
 
there

03:05:34.030 --> 03:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:05:42.269 --> 03:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:42.279 --> 03:05:46.389 align:start position:0%
 
far

03:05:46.389 --> 03:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:12.190 --> 03:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:12.200 --> 03:06:23.550 align:start position:0%
 
folks

03:06:23.550 --> 03:06:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:26.070 --> 03:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
hello folks thanks for hearing me
 
03:06:26.080 --> 03:06:28.349 align:start position:0%
hello folks thanks for hearing me
today

03:06:28.349 --> 03:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:06:32.030 --> 03:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
um I decided to write this bill because
 
03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
a number of people before you start uh
 
03:06:37.429 --> 03:06:37.439 align:start position:0%
give me your name and your town Mark
 
03:06:42.190 --> 03:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:42.200 --> 03:06:48.030 align:start position:0%
 
Hopkinton

03:06:48.030 --> 03:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:50.510 --> 03:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
and I find
 
03:06:53.630 --> 03:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
that by examining the Constitution and
 
03:06:55.750 --> 03:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
looking at our
 
03:06:59.910 --> 03:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
rsas um the reason why I wrote this was
 
03:07:01.429 --> 03:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:07:07.910 --> 03:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
RSA the 6 5640 was passed in
 
03:07:10.830 --> 03:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
1979 and it was created to utilize
 
03:07:14.870 --> 03:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
voting machines on a temporary
 
03:07:21.030 --> 03:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
basis to me that is overriding our
 
03:07:23.990 --> 03:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution and our
 
03:07:28.110 --> 03:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
constitution part two article 32 talks
 
03:07:30.389 --> 03:07:30.399 align:start position:0%
about voting so I'm going to read
 
03:07:31.870 --> 03:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
something quickly here and then I'm
 
03:07:33.309 --> 03:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
going to explain a couple of things
 
03:07:35.790 --> 03:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
about the bill and I'll be
 
03:07:38.309 --> 03:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
done the the New Hampshire state
 
03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
constitution is the law of the land to
 
03:07:40.800 --> 03:07:42.110 align:start position:0%
constitution is the law of the land to
be

03:07:42.110 --> 03:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:43.630 align:start position:0%
be
enforced

03:07:43.630 --> 03:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
03:07:47.590 --> 03:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
unless amended written in 1783 and
 
03:07:50.670 --> 03:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
rewarded in the 1792 part two article 32
 
03:07:54.830 --> 03:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
specifies how and when votes are to be
 
03:07:54.840 --> 03:07:56.429 align:start position:0%
specifies how and when votes are to be
counted

03:07:56.429 --> 03:07:56.439 align:start position:0%
counted
 
03:07:59.590 --> 03:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
and it has not been amended it has not
 
03:08:02.710 --> 03:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
been changed so to amend the an article
 
03:08:05.150 --> 03:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution required by a vote
 
03:08:08.670 --> 03:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
consent to the people I article 32
 
03:08:11.750 --> 03:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
clearly states that votes be governed by
 
03:08:13.750 --> 03:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
a moderator who shall in the presence of
 
03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
selectman whose Duty it shall be to
 
03:08:19.269 --> 03:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
attend an open meeting receive the votes
 
03:08:21.429 --> 03:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
of all of the inhabitants of such towns
 
03:08:23.870 --> 03:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
and WS pres and shell in said meetings
 
03:08:26.670 --> 03:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
in the president of the said selectman
 
03:08:30.269 --> 03:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
and the town or city CER clerk in said
 
03:08:33.070 --> 03:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
meetings sort and count said votes I
 
03:08:35.510 --> 03:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
03:08:39.910 --> 03:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
electronic vote counting device anywhere
 
03:08:41.389 --> 03:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
in article
 
03:08:43.670 --> 03:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
32 so we
 
03:08:47.110 --> 03:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
have machines in this
 
03:08:50.990 --> 03:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
state that are not constitutional for us
 
03:08:54.349 --> 03:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
to use to vote with I can prove it 10
 
03:08:56.030 --> 03:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
different ways from
 
03:08:59.309 --> 03:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
China so these machines are
 
03:09:01.790 --> 03:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous and I decided to write this
 
03:09:04.190 --> 03:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
bill and what happened was I was
 
03:09:06.950 --> 03:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
contacted about it 4 days before I
 
03:09:09.870 --> 03:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
started writing about it and I worked
 
03:09:12.030 --> 03:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
around the clock to write it because we
 
03:09:15.070 --> 03:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
had to pass it into by a certain date
 
03:09:16.590 --> 03:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
and when it got passed in it was my
 
03:09:19.590 --> 03:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
first draft and that first draft came
 
03:09:22.510 --> 03:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
back from the lob quite marked up and
 
03:09:25.030 --> 03:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't look anything like the bill that
 
03:09:28.150 --> 03:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
I created so you folks have in hand
 
03:09:31.469 --> 03:09:31.479 align:start position:0%
now my second and final
 
03:09:35.510 --> 03:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
draft and um so the negatives negative
 
03:09:38.150 --> 03:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
connotations that were found in this
 
03:09:39.750 --> 03:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
03:09:39.760 --> 03:09:41.309 align:start position:0%
bill that
came

03:09:41.309 --> 03:09:41.319 align:start position:0%
came
 
03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:47.510 --> 03:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:09:53.469 --> 03:09:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:56.950 --> 03:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
someplace no I don't I need
 
03:10:00.070 --> 03:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
to yeah if you look at methodology on
 
03:10:03.429 --> 03:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
the second to last page it speaks about
 
03:10:07.070 --> 03:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
the costs so on and so forth I've made
 
03:10:09.190 --> 03:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
all of those with my second
 
03:10:11.670 --> 03:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
draft I've made all of those with my
 
03:10:14.269 --> 03:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
second draft very irrelevant the costs
 
03:10:16.110 --> 03:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
have mostly gone
 
03:10:22.349 --> 03:10:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:25.950 --> 03:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
see yes methodology so there are a list
 
03:10:28.469 --> 03:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
of negatives there mandating one poll in
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
place for every 5,000 El eligible voters
 
03:10:34.550 --> 03:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
is gone requiring all ballots to be
 
03:10:37.910 --> 03:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
stored in a 24 continuous 24-hour
 
03:10:40.870 --> 03:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
continuously electronically surveyed
 
03:10:44.349 --> 03:10:44.359 align:start position:0%
secured that's basically turned into at
 
03:10:47.670 --> 03:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
the town where they collect the votes in
 
03:10:50.190 --> 03:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
the new draft they're held and then
 
03:10:52.830 --> 03:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
brought up as usual by a selectman but
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
they will need to be archived at the
 
03:10:58.110 --> 03:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
State uh the state archives that's where
 
03:11:00.349 --> 03:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
the ballots are held now but the only
 
03:11:02.429 --> 03:11:02.439 align:start position:0%
difference will be surveillance at the
 
03:11:04.630 --> 03:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
state archives in a in a different way
 
03:11:07.550 --> 03:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
of order but all these different things
 
03:11:11.349 --> 03:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
here are basically alleviated that you
 
03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
see in theth mythology
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I've I've basically taken wipe those
 
03:11:19.750 --> 03:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
out with my
 
03:11:21.910 --> 03:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
second uh second
 
03:11:25.030 --> 03:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
draft so there you have it that's that's
 
03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
all I can say
 
03:11:27.040 --> 03:11:29.030 align:start position:0%
all I can say
um

03:11:29.030 --> 03:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:31.429 --> 03:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
the NS and bolts of it are there for you
 
03:11:34.349 --> 03:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
to read if you have any questions I'd be
 
03:11:36.870 --> 03:11:36.880 align:start position:0%

03:11:49.510 --> 03:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
election I have not okay I have not but
 
03:11:52.910 --> 03:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
I've studied them deeply I've been up to
 
03:11:54.910 --> 03:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
the state house here probably more than
 
03:11:56.870 --> 03:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
most of the Reps do in one turn since
 
03:12:01.550 --> 03:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
1992 and I've watched closely okay thank
 
03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:04.080 align:start position:0%

03:12:13.030 --> 03:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate the work that you

have done on both
 
03:12:18.510 --> 03:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
drafts um and I understand your
 
03:12:20.389 --> 03:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
testimony is that you
 
03:12:24.309 --> 03:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
have taken all of the negatives out of
 
03:12:25.670 --> 03:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
the first
 
03:12:28.870 --> 03:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
one uh to make the second one one of
 
03:12:31.750 --> 03:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
them being the suitable polling place
 
03:12:35.550 --> 03:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
for every 5,000 eligible voters right
 
03:12:38.510 --> 03:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
your second draft says limit all polling
 
03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
locations to 5,000 lawful voters and
 
03:12:45.990 --> 03:12:46.000 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman uh members of the

committee I'm David scanland Secretary

of State here in opposition to House
 
03:13:50.520 --> 03:13:51.630 align:start position:0%
of State here in opposition to House
Bill

03:13:51.630 --> 03:13:51.640 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:13:54.429 --> 03:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
1704 uh frankly when I started to read
 
03:13:57.229 --> 03:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
this bill I I really couldn't get beyond
 
03:14:00.229 --> 03:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
the end of the first page where the Bill
 
03:14:03.269 --> 03:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
calls for placing serial numbers on
 
03:14:06.550 --> 03:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
every ballot along with a perforated uh
 
03:14:09.030 --> 03:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
receipt that goes along with that and if
 
03:14:11.710 --> 03:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
you were here this morning uh in
 
03:14:15.429 --> 03:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
testimony that I gave on an earlier Bill
 
03:14:17.150 --> 03:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh one of the most fundamental things
 
03:14:20.309 --> 03:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
about conducting El an election is that
 
03:14:22.670 --> 03:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
every voter should be guaranteed that
 
03:14:25.990 --> 03:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
their ballot is going to be secret and
 
03:14:28.229 --> 03:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
private and anytime you put a
 
03:14:31.429 --> 03:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
distinguishing number on a ballot that
 
03:14:33.990 --> 03:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
can be tied to the voter that is a
 
03:14:37.190 --> 03:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
serious problem and so I would oppose
 
03:14:40.349 --> 03:14:40.359 align:start position:0%
this bill just on that basis um I
 
03:14:43.349 --> 03:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that we we had an issue
 
03:14:45.990 --> 03:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
with vote buying and intimidation
 
03:14:47.750 --> 03:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
schemes prior to
 
03:14:50.990 --> 03:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
1890 um because there were ways for
 
03:14:54.429 --> 03:14:54.439 align:start position:0%
individuals to find out how people voted
 
03:14:56.550 --> 03:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
and this bill basically goes back to
 
03:15:00.190 --> 03:15:00.200 align:start position:0%
that uh that time frame and creates that
 
03:15:02.630 --> 03:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity especially where the bill
 
03:15:05.429 --> 03:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
says that you can take the perforated
 
03:15:07.870 --> 03:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
receipt go to the town clerk or the
 
03:15:09.630 --> 03:15:09.640 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State whoever's housing
 
03:15:13.550 --> 03:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
those ballots for a period of 5 years
 
03:15:15.510 --> 03:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
and actually obtain a copy of that
 
03:15:17.670 --> 03:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
ballot that you could then show to
 
03:15:19.950 --> 03:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
somebody that might be offering n money
 
03:15:24.110 --> 03:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
for uh purchasing a vote so uh just on
 
03:15:25.830 --> 03:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
that basis alone I would urge the
 
03:15:27.990 --> 03:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
committee to kill this bill and I'd be
 
03:15:29.870 --> 03:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions questions
 
03:15:32.910 --> 03:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
K representative B thank you Mr chairman
 
03:15:36.030 --> 03:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
on the constitutionality issue could you
 
03:15:39.349 --> 03:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
please relate to that like it counting
 
03:15:41.110 --> 03:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
how doesn't say anything how it's
 
03:15:45.590 --> 03:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
counted correct yes and I I think that
 
03:15:48.670 --> 03:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh the prior testimony is certainly an
 
03:15:52.429 --> 03:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
opinion on what the Constitution says uh
 
03:15:54.710 --> 03:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
I believe that the courts have taken
 
03:15:58.070 --> 03:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
this issue up in in past cases and from
 
03:16:00.550 --> 03:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
my perspective the Constitution says
 
03:16:04.110 --> 03:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
that the vote shall be sorted counted in
 
03:16:07.229 --> 03:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
public which is what happens it's just
 
03:16:09.110 --> 03:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
that there's a ballot counting device
 
03:16:11.309 --> 03:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
that's counting those ballots instead of
 
03:16:14.469 --> 03:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
teams of uh volunteers at the polling
 
03:16:17.349 --> 03:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
place thank you further questions
 
03:16:20.870 --> 03:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative Brenan thank you are you
 
03:16:24.550 --> 03:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
aware that there have been numerous
 
03:16:30.070 --> 03:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
studies done uh testing done that shows
 
03:16:30.080 --> 03:16:31.389 align:start position:0%
studies done uh testing done that shows
that

03:16:31.389 --> 03:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:34.710 --> 03:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
tabulators uh ballot counting devices
 
03:16:38.550 --> 03:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
more accurately tally the votes than
 
03:16:40.790 --> 03:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
hand counting or another way that there
 
03:16:44.269 --> 03:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
are more errors in hand counting than
 
03:16:47.870 --> 03:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
there are with the use of tabulators or
 
03:16:49.349 --> 03:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
ballot counting
 
03:16:53.030 --> 03:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
devices I'm aware of studies uh to that
 
03:16:54.990 --> 03:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
effect and they confirm that but you
 
03:16:57.630 --> 03:16:57.640 align:start position:0%
know I don't want to minimize the
 
03:16:59.349 --> 03:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
concern that's out there sometimes the
 
03:17:04.510 --> 03:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
machines fail and and and uh we saw that
 
03:17:07.229 --> 03:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
happen in Windam uh in New Hampshire
 
03:17:09.389 --> 03:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
when you know a crease through an oval
 
03:17:11.910 --> 03:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
was improperly counting ballots and so
 
03:17:14.030 --> 03:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
when things like that happen it it
 
03:17:14.040 --> 03:17:15.550 align:start position:0%
when things like that happen it it
certainly

03:17:15.550 --> 03:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
03:17:18.670 --> 03:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
um causes some concern and the way we
 
03:17:20.630 --> 03:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
deal with that is we have a robust way
 
03:17:23.950 --> 03:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh we can verify the
 
03:17:26.950 --> 03:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
results whether it's an audit process or
 
03:17:28.550 --> 03:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know a formal type of review of
 
03:17:30.950 --> 03:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
ballots but then when that process is
 
03:17:34.150 --> 03:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
done there needs to be finality to the
 
03:17:38.030 --> 03:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
election followup please
 
03:17:42.229 --> 03:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
yes are you satisfied with the two new
 
03:17:44.469 --> 03:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
new ballot counting
 
03:17:47.469 --> 03:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
devices that there would be minimal
 
03:17:50.590 --> 03:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
errors and with our process of auditing
 
03:17:54.229 --> 03:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
via hand counting uh
 
03:17:57.389 --> 03:17:57.399 align:start position:0%
in uh in the way that you that is
 
03:17:59.070 --> 03:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
prescribed in law in the way that you
 
03:18:01.229 --> 03:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
typically follow are you satisfied with
 
03:18:04.229 --> 03:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
the two new Bal counting devices and our
 
03:18:06.870 --> 03:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
established processes for auditing
 
03:18:11.150 --> 03:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
elections that there would be no need to
 
03:18:16.389 --> 03:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
mandate and Counting um as this bill
 
03:18:18.590 --> 03:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
does well we went through a very
 
03:18:22.830 --> 03:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
rigorous process to uh so that the
 
03:18:24.710 --> 03:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
battle lock commission could approve a
 
03:18:26.990 --> 03:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
couple of devices one of those is an
 
03:18:28.429 --> 03:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
open source
 
03:18:31.790 --> 03:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
software code that is nonproprietary so
 
03:18:33.389 --> 03:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
anybody can take a look at that I think
 
03:18:36.590 --> 03:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
that instills confidence but I think we
 
03:18:39.710 --> 03:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
still need to have the opportunity for
 
03:18:42.550 --> 03:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh hand recounts where we look at every
 
03:18:44.750 --> 03:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
single ballot and that those ballots can
 
03:18:47.469 --> 03:18:47.479 align:start position:0%
be challenged as part of that process
 
03:18:50.070 --> 03:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that we need to come up with
 
03:18:53.550 --> 03:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
a good audit system that will instill
 
03:18:56.070 --> 03:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
confidence in the results and you know
 
03:18:58.389 --> 03:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
we know that the legislature tried to
 
03:19:01.710 --> 03:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
address that that last time and um
 
03:19:03.189 --> 03:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
didn't work out that well so hopefully
 
03:19:05.389 --> 03:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
we can do a better job this time thank
 
03:19:08.429 --> 03:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
you further questions seeing none thank
 
03:19:11.030 --> 03:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
you next up is rousan
 
03:19:11.040 --> 03:19:17.710 align:start position:0%
you next up is rousan
Chester

03:19:17.710 --> 03:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:19.110 --> 03:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
03:19:21.389 --> 03:19:21.399 align:start position:0%
committee members um my name is russan
 
03:19:23.870 --> 03:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
Chester I live in Bedford New Hampshire
 
03:19:26.150 --> 03:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
um I've been involved with election
 
03:19:29.229 --> 03:19:29.239 align:start position:0%
Integrity for many many years in New
 
03:19:32.830 --> 03:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um with concerns going as far
 
03:19:34.510 --> 03:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
back as when I lived in hooks at New
 
03:19:37.710 --> 03:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh so that's more than 15
 
03:19:40.870 --> 03:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
years ago um I did not become involved
 
03:19:42.590 --> 03:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
until the Dominion
 
03:19:47.870 --> 03:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
machines became um common place in New
 
03:19:50.910 --> 03:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh but the bottom line is is
 
03:19:55.469 --> 03:19:55.479 align:start position:0%
that there is a huge issue of trust and
 
03:19:56.670 --> 03:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
03:20:00.710 --> 03:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
transparency at my town every single
 
03:20:05.510 --> 03:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
election there are anomalies there are
 
03:20:09.349 --> 03:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
issues uh in 2020 we ran out of ballots
 
03:20:12.070 --> 03:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
so we took a bunch of copies there was
 
03:20:15.150 --> 03:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
no chain of command there was no
 
03:20:17.349 --> 03:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
everybody was just doing their own thing
 
03:20:19.110 --> 03:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
and that's not okay so that's a little
 
03:20:21.110 --> 03:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
bit where the audit responsibility comes
 
03:20:23.750 --> 03:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the other issue is the machines that
 
03:20:26.150 --> 03:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
we use currently sir can you turn the
 
03:20:27.710 --> 03:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
flash off on your
 
03:20:30.510 --> 03:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
camera thank you I was like I don't have
 
03:20:31.550 --> 03:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
a flash
 
03:20:37.830 --> 03:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
on um the the other um issue is that is
 
03:20:40.870 --> 03:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
that the current machines that we use
 
03:20:43.630 --> 03:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
are what they call completed
 
03:20:48.110 --> 03:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
closed uh we have no transparency
 
03:20:50.630 --> 03:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I was a programmer back in
 
03:20:53.349 --> 03:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
the 70s I don't know if you folks most
 
03:20:55.950 --> 03:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
of you folks probably don't remember uh
 
03:20:58.030 --> 03:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
don't go back that far but one of our
 
03:21:00.150 --> 03:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
sayings used to say garbage in garbage
 
03:21:04.389 --> 03:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
out and these programmers all LHS is is
 
03:21:08.030 --> 03:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
a middleman they are not proprietary
 
03:21:10.110 --> 03:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
they do not own these machines they do
 
03:21:12.469 --> 03:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
not make these machines they do do not
 
03:21:16.590 --> 03:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
manufacture these all they do is do the
 
03:21:20.229 --> 03:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
program that is sent to them on those
 
03:21:24.229 --> 03:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
chips and they update it but no one here
 
03:21:26.469 --> 03:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
at the State of New Hampshire is allowed
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
to see what that program says there is
 
03:21:32.309 --> 03:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely no checks and balances so the
 
03:21:35.389 --> 03:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
fact that we have two systems one is LHS
 
03:21:37.309 --> 03:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
which is a completely closed and the
 
03:21:39.469 --> 03:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
other one that's an open source now the
 
03:21:42.030 --> 03:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
nice thing about the open source is that
 
03:21:43.830 --> 03:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
anybody it's very
 
03:21:46.349 --> 03:21:46.359 align:start position:0%
transparent and transparency is so
 
03:21:49.229 --> 03:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
important right now in our elections in
 
03:21:52.110 --> 03:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
every aspect of Our Lives because we the
 
03:21:54.750 --> 03:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
people do not
 
03:21:57.510 --> 03:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
trust the people that are in our
 
03:21:59.510 --> 03:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
government positions we don't trust our
 
03:22:01.910 --> 03:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
election officials in some cases
 
03:22:03.950 --> 03:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes we do but I don't know if you
 
03:22:07.630 --> 03:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
folks remember Bedford from 20120 where
 
03:22:13.550 --> 03:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
1,500 missing uh Mi uncounted mail-in
 
03:22:16.830 --> 03:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
ballots were withheld now that was not a
 
03:22:19.429 --> 03:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
machine issue that was a people issue
 
03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is head the attorney
 
03:22:25.790 --> 03:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
who was the assistant an attorney who
 
03:22:28.510 --> 03:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
was an assistant moderator had not
 
03:22:31.750 --> 03:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
advocated to keep it a secret we would
 
03:22:34.469 --> 03:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
have found out about those 1500 ballots
 
03:22:38.950 --> 03:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
and those 1500 mailin absentee ballots
 
03:22:40.750 --> 03:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
may not have been
 
03:22:44.469 --> 03:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised it is time for complete
 
03:22:47.429 --> 03:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
transparency and I hear about robust
 
03:22:49.950 --> 03:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
Audits and when we're going to have a
 
03:22:52.389 --> 03:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
problem well I was just at the most
 
03:22:56.870 --> 03:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
recent election in Bedford and I watched
 
03:23:00.670 --> 03:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
a town counselor bring up four
 
03:23:04.550 --> 03:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
batches of ballots that they
 
03:23:06.910 --> 03:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
found to be hand
 
03:23:10.429 --> 03:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
counted now how does that happen there
 
03:23:13.469 --> 03:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
is absolutely no transparency and this
 
03:23:16.229 --> 03:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
bill allows the bottom line is things
 
03:23:20.389 --> 03:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
are so broken can we even talk about
 
03:23:21.790 --> 03:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
well we'll just use the machines and
 
03:23:24.990 --> 03:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
we'll keep going it is unconstitution
 
03:23:27.990 --> 03:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
the Constitution is not an opinion the
 
03:23:31.309 --> 03:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution is clear the Constitution
 
03:23:35.830 --> 03:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
says every ballot will be handled will
 
03:23:38.550 --> 03:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
be hand counted now if you folks want to
 
03:23:41.670 --> 03:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
use a tabulating machine and then as a
 
03:23:44.349 --> 03:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
second do a hand count well then you're
 
03:23:46.389 --> 03:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
meeting the the requirement of the
 
03:23:48.429 --> 03:23:48.439 align:start position:0%
Constitution but to say that the
 
03:23:50.790 --> 03:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
constitution is an
 
03:23:53.070 --> 03:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
opinion is
 
03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
egregious in my
 
03:23:59.510 --> 03:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
opinion I have years and years of
 
03:24:03.429 --> 03:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
watching things go not quite right the
 
03:24:05.830 --> 03:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
election before this one in
 
03:24:09.110 --> 03:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
2022 I submitted
 
03:24:12.269 --> 03:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
23 issues that were brought before the
 
03:24:14.229 --> 03:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and or the Attorney
 
03:24:14.239 --> 03:24:15.349 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and or the Attorney
General's

03:24:15.349 --> 03:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
General's
 
03:24:17.670 --> 03:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
office because I sat there and watched
 
03:24:20.150 --> 03:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
it it's happening it's happening
 
03:24:22.870 --> 03:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
throughout our state and there's already
 
03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of towns that do hand counts when
 
03:24:27.389 --> 03:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
the machines went down this past
 
03:24:31.590 --> 03:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
election even more had to do hand counts
 
03:24:33.870 --> 03:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
maybe it's time to get back to basics
 
03:24:36.070 --> 03:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's not going to take much longer
 
03:24:38.389 --> 03:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
especially with the poll books right now
 
03:24:40.110 --> 03:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
which is another disaster because it
 
03:24:42.349 --> 03:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
switched over over 4 00 people in our
 
03:24:44.229 --> 03:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
town got switched from their
 
03:24:44.239 --> 03:24:46.990 align:start position:0%
town got switched from their
party

03:24:46.990 --> 03:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
party
 
03:24:50.870 --> 03:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
somehow electronics are only as good as
 
03:24:50.880 --> 03:24:51.750 align:start position:0%
somehow electronics are only as good as
the

03:24:51.750 --> 03:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:24:55.150 --> 03:24:55.160 align:start position:0%
programmers Electronics can
 
03:25:00.229 --> 03:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
always always be hacked and yes not all
 
03:25:02.830 --> 03:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
people are righteous not all people have
 
03:25:05.110 --> 03:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
ethics and morals but I would rather
 
03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
trust my town clerk and my elected
 
03:25:09.910 --> 03:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
officials than dominan voting machines
 
03:25:13.510 --> 03:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:15.150 --> 03:25:15.160 align:start position:0%
and I'll stop
 
03:25:17.349 --> 03:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
there questions from the
 
03:25:19.830 --> 03:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you oh I'm
 
03:25:21.349 --> 03:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Brennan got get
 
03:25:22.950 --> 03:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
that hand up
 
03:25:27.510 --> 03:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
high thank you are you aware
 
03:25:31.550 --> 03:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
of a nearly $800 million
 
03:25:33.950 --> 03:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
settlement of from
 
03:25:38.910 --> 03:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
defamation from Fox Corporation Fox News
 
03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
against uh or other way around Dominion
 
03:25:45.790 --> 03:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
against Fox News the claims that they
 
03:25:47.189 --> 03:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
made about the
 
03:25:51.750 --> 03:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
Dominion tabulating machines um that Fox
 
03:25:54.269 --> 03:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
News needed to pay out almost $800
 
03:25:57.189 --> 03:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
million for lies that were told about
 
03:26:00.550 --> 03:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
Dominion machines I am aware of that as
 
03:26:04.830 --> 03:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
I am also aware of the um uh research
 
03:26:08.070 --> 03:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
that was done by Harry hursty prior to
 
03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
the Windam audit that showed how easily
 
03:26:16.309 --> 03:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
was to hack the Dominion machines thank
 
03:26:18.510 --> 03:26:18.520 align:start position:0%

03:26:40.349 --> 03:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
all right yeah so you guys know you they
 
03:26:41.830 --> 03:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
had a big meeting of like hey if
 
03:26:42.790 --> 03:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to do a followup they're
 
03:26:45.550 --> 03:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to ask and it's like okay so
 
03:26:47.830 --> 03:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
just doing what the boss says um any
 
03:26:50.630 --> 03:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
other questions all right hearing none
 
03:26:50.640 --> 03:26:51.349 align:start position:0%
other questions all right hearing none
thank

03:26:51.349 --> 03:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:26:56.429 --> 03:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
you um M Markus Mr you refiled um I'm
 
03:26:58.309 --> 03:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
going to indulge you on this um the
 
03:27:00.630 --> 03:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
hearing is not a debate so if you have
 
03:27:03.870 --> 03:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
additional testimony to give that's fine
 
03:27:05.790 --> 03:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
um but it is not the hearing for the
 
03:27:07.309 --> 03:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
general public is not a debate so we
 
03:27:09.150 --> 03:27:09.160 align:start position:0%
can't start up a back and forth so are
 
03:27:13.510 --> 03:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:16.910 --> 03:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
the uh ballots that the Secretary of
 
03:27:20.030 --> 03:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
State asked about the perforations on or
 
03:27:22.510 --> 03:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
didn't bring up the preparations so the
 
03:27:24.309 --> 03:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
ballots would be
 
03:27:27.670 --> 03:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
printed like this on three pieces of
 
03:27:31.030 --> 03:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
paper and it would be perforated on the
 
03:27:34.349 --> 03:27:34.359 align:start position:0%
top and there would be a number on the
 
03:27:37.910 --> 03:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
top on that perforation that the person
 
03:27:40.389 --> 03:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
tears off and carries with them and it
 
03:27:41.710 --> 03:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
would match the number number on the
 
03:27:44.469 --> 03:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
ballot it does not have their name on it
 
03:27:46.229 --> 03:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
or anything like that so if there's a
 
03:27:48.830 --> 03:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
recount on the ballots everybody can
 
03:27:50.910 --> 03:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
take that perforated Tab and come back
 
03:27:53.870 --> 03:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
and see proof of their ballot that's
 
03:27:56.030 --> 03:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
very important
 
03:27:58.950 --> 03:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
secondly um paper ballots are the gold
 
03:28:02.630 --> 03:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
standard of uh of voting and machines
 
03:28:07.030 --> 03:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
are pretty dangerous as I said before um
 
03:28:09.469 --> 03:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
the issues with these devices are only
 
03:28:11.510 --> 03:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
discovered through hand counts if
 
03:28:14.389 --> 03:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
they're allowed hand counts challenging
 
03:28:16.830 --> 03:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
the machine count may may only be
 
03:28:18.910 --> 03:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
requested by candidates and I don't like
 
03:28:21.229 --> 03:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
that it should be able be bu the
 
03:28:22.750 --> 03:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
citizens that they're
 
03:28:27.510 --> 03:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
requested and and the um the issues with
 
03:28:30.110 --> 03:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
these ballots used for devices noted in
 
03:28:32.830 --> 03:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
Windom in the Windom audit report
 
03:28:36.269 --> 03:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
included but not limited to different
 
03:28:38.950 --> 03:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
paper thicknesses s folds C
 
03:28:41.670 --> 03:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
folds um and many other things that
 
03:28:43.550 --> 03:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
caused overboots where the device could
 
03:28:48.150 --> 03:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
not read and fails fails to do the fails
 
03:28:48.160 --> 03:28:49.189 align:start position:0%
not read and fails fails to do the fails
fails

03:28:49.189 --> 03:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
fails
 
03:28:53.309 --> 03:28:53.319 align:start position:0%
to uh properly show the the town these
 
03:28:57.550 --> 03:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
machines um are dangerous and we have a
 
03:29:02.110 --> 03:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
company named LS LHS Associates based in
 
03:29:05.710 --> 03:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
chum New Hampshire and this supposed to
 
03:29:08.429 --> 03:29:08.439 align:start position:0%
be safeguarding the voter's integrity
 
03:29:11.710 --> 03:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
and sovereignty um
 
03:29:15.309 --> 03:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
this this company has no government
 
03:29:18.950 --> 03:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
oversight nor any Audits and they put
 
03:29:20.750 --> 03:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
all the machines that we have in New
 
03:29:23.670 --> 03:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire into New Hampshire so I'm I'm
 
03:29:26.750 --> 03:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
also sad to disagree with you Mr
 
03:29:32.750 --> 03:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
secretary but um the article 32 part two
 
03:29:33.710 --> 03:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
of The
 
03:29:36.750 --> 03:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution is pretty strongly written
 
03:29:39.389 --> 03:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
and to see it overwritten and then
 
03:29:43.830 --> 03:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
see uh these committees that think that
 
03:29:46.710 --> 03:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
the constitution is just an
 
03:29:50.229 --> 03:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
opinion uh or people when they say that
 
03:29:51.870 --> 03:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
that's very bothersome to me if we're
 
03:29:53.870 --> 03:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
not following that Constitution we're
 
03:29:55.910 --> 03:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
really in trouble thank you very much
 
03:29:57.510 --> 03:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
for your
 
03:29:59.590 --> 03:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
time representative
 
03:30:03.229 --> 03:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
wooden thank you Mr chair um I wanted to
 
03:30:05.070 --> 03:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
ask for clarification in the question
 
03:30:08.030 --> 03:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
that okay that's fine okay you so the
 
03:30:10.030 --> 03:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
way you described
 
03:30:10.040 --> 03:30:12.030 align:start position:0%
way you described
this

03:30:12.030 --> 03:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:30:13.870 --> 03:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
the way you describe this the
 
03:30:16.510 --> 03:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
perforation does not stay with the
 
03:30:18.550 --> 03:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
ballot that's correct the ballots would
 
03:30:20.870 --> 03:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
be printed in such a way you remember
 
03:30:22.630 --> 03:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
the old time cards when we were younger
 
03:30:24.990 --> 03:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
we used to put them in the clock okay it
 
03:30:26.710 --> 03:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
would be a time card like that but it
 
03:30:28.950 --> 03:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
would be three separate
 
03:30:31.030 --> 03:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
pieces and they're printed and they're
 
03:30:33.710 --> 03:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
put together and then the top is
 
03:30:36.429 --> 03:30:36.439 align:start position:0%
perforated mhm the voter tears that
 
03:30:39.309 --> 03:30:39.319 align:start position:0%
perforation off folds it and tears it
 
03:30:41.670 --> 03:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
and puts that in the pocket and then the
 
03:30:44.630 --> 03:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
vote goes in so no names are written on
 
03:30:47.590 --> 03:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
that okay and uh my question is are you
 
03:30:51.229 --> 03:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
aware of any other state doing that I
 
03:30:53.429 --> 03:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
believe Idaho is doing something like
 
03:30:56.469 --> 03:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
that and has brought something in but I
 
03:30:58.710 --> 03:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
I didn't have a lot of time to to do
 
03:31:01.790 --> 03:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
research on this thank you thank you Mr
 
03:31:06.110 --> 03:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
chair okay uh representative uh
 
03:31:08.110 --> 03:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
weary uh since you brought the
 
03:31:09.830 --> 03:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution are you aware of any
 
03:31:12.630 --> 03:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
current cases before for uh New
 
03:31:14.790 --> 03:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire supreme court regarding the
 
03:31:17.950 --> 03:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of the voting process
 
03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
yes I'm aware of a few cases but I
 
03:31:23.630 --> 03:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
haven't watched them closely okay
 
03:31:28.110 --> 03:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you um are
 
03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
you do you
 
03:31:34.590 --> 03:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
know um the costs of hand counting um
 
03:31:36.469 --> 03:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
one of the things you had suggested was
 
03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
that any citizen should be able to
 
03:31:42.189 --> 03:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
request a a recount rather than just the
 
03:31:45.150 --> 03:31:45.160 align:start position:0%
candidate um and if I'm understanding
 
03:31:49.229 --> 03:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
your testimony correctly you're wanting
 
03:31:51.630 --> 03:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
um any individual to be able to request
 
03:31:53.349 --> 03:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
a hand
 
03:31:57.150 --> 03:31:57.160 align:start position:0%
count do you know the costs associated
 
03:32:01.150 --> 03:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
with hand counting and if such a law
 
03:32:04.150 --> 03:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
were to be passed that any citizen could
 
03:32:07.790 --> 03:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
request a hand count what that cost
 
03:32:09.349 --> 03:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
would be to the
 
03:32:11.429 --> 03:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers it would probably be very
 
03:32:14.229 --> 03:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
limited because if two or three people
 
03:32:16.870 --> 03:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
in each town or County suddenly mourn in
 
03:32:20.229 --> 03:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
the can come they they'd be finding a
 
03:32:23.870 --> 03:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
lot of dirt and I would see on the
 
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
opposite end of that kind of behavior
 
03:32:29.150 --> 03:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
people would not be wanting to play with
 
03:32:31.910 --> 03:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
fire and I've also found that hand
 
03:32:35.269 --> 03:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
counting this is common sense is far
 
03:32:37.550 --> 03:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
less expensive than these machines that
 
03:32:40.830 --> 03:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
we've got to purchase to maintain them
 
03:32:42.830 --> 03:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
and to keep them
 
03:32:46.790 --> 03:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
up I think I I and I also will state
 
03:32:49.550 --> 03:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
this strongly the sovereignty of each
 
03:32:52.070 --> 03:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
individual in this country because it's
 
03:32:56.590 --> 03:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
a republic is highly important so when
 
03:32:58.710 --> 03:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
we go off that gold
 
03:33:02.110 --> 03:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
standard of each individual having a
 
03:33:05.830 --> 03:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
ballot we're losing doesn't matter the
 
03:33:08.990 --> 03:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
the accuracy of Machinery is not there
 
03:33:12.790 --> 03:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
and will never be as fast as in mind in
 
03:33:15.950 --> 03:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
things like like this situation never so
 
03:33:19.550 --> 03:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
I I strongly believe in each individual
 
03:33:21.790 --> 03:33:21.800 align:start position:0%
casting their own
 
03:33:25.229 --> 03:33:25.239 align:start position:0%
ballot and the reason why is because my
 
03:33:28.189 --> 03:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
freedom the freedom of your children my
 
03:33:29.750 --> 03:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
children my
 
03:33:33.550 --> 03:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
grandchildren is all county is all it's
 
03:33:35.670 --> 03:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's all balancing on that right now and
 
03:33:37.070 --> 03:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
they're getting away with murder with
 
03:33:39.710 --> 03:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
the machines I just would hate to see
 
03:33:42.110 --> 03:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
that in our state
 
03:33:45.710 --> 03:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you um next up
 
03:33:49.150 --> 03:33:49.160 align:start position:0%
we'll do um natches
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
gray I'm Nate just I'm just going to
 
03:33:53.469 --> 03:33:53.479 align:start position:0%
butcher it every time man I I I don't
 
03:33:56.349 --> 03:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
know where we're at at this point that's
 
03:33:58.990 --> 03:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
that's totally fine Mr chair n Grays
 
03:34:01.870 --> 03:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
with the municipal Association if if it
 
03:34:05.189 --> 03:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
helps you n like nature gray like the
 
03:34:09.309 --> 03:34:09.319 align:start position:0%
color um I we also oppose this
 
03:34:11.950 --> 03:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
legislation I will
 
03:34:14.309 --> 03:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
I Echo everything the secretary of state
 
03:34:17.429 --> 03:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
says I have not had the opportunity to
 
03:34:20.389 --> 03:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
review any amendment that was passed out
 
03:34:24.150 --> 03:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
um the legislative budget uh assistant
 
03:34:27.670 --> 03:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
was kind enough to put um a long list of
 
03:34:30.070 --> 03:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
things that may cost municipalities
 
03:34:34.389 --> 03:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
money into uh the fiscal note um I won't
 
03:34:37.429 --> 03:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
read those to you but that is basically
 
03:34:39.389 --> 03:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
the uh the basis for a number of
 
03:34:42.630 --> 03:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have in addition to
 
03:34:44.990 --> 03:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
overriding concerns like the secrecy of
 
03:34:46.750 --> 03:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
the ballot and the importance of that
 
03:34:48.309 --> 03:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions the
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
committee may have questions from the
 
03:34:53.710 --> 03:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
committee okay representative Brennan do
 
03:34:56.990 --> 03:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
you know the costs associated with hand
 
03:34:57.000 --> 03:34:58.510 align:start position:0%
you know the costs associated with hand
counting

03:34:58.510 --> 03:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
counting
 
03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
ballots I do not know off the top of my
 
03:35:04.030 --> 03:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
head but I believe there was a bill last
 
03:35:05.990 --> 03:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
year or the prior session that had a
 
03:35:07.389 --> 03:35:07.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal note attached to it that would
 
03:35:09.910 --> 03:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
give you that information thank you any
 
03:35:12.469 --> 03:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
further questions seeing none thank Youk
 
03:35:13.630 --> 03:35:13.640 align:start position:0%
um no other speakers are sign up to
 
03:35:15.670 --> 03:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
speak in person there were 37 people
 
03:35:18.189 --> 03:35:18.199 align:start position:0%
signed up online in Support 32 opposed
 
03:35:19.990 --> 03:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
zero were neutral with that I'll be
 
03:35:24.150 --> 03:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
closing the public hearing on 7 HB 1704
 
03:35:26.429 --> 03:35:26.439 align:start position:0%
and opening the public hearing on
 
03:35:30.389 --> 03:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
HB 1699 allowing caucus identification
 
03:35:33.950 --> 03:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
on ballots um representative gearhard I
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
saw you do I have a pink card for me
 
03:35:36.479 --> 03:35:38.070 align:start position:0%
saw you do I have a pink card for me
representative

03:35:38.070 --> 03:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:35:54.309 --> 03:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:56.670 --> 03:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
him representative Penza you want to
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
stand I saw represented Penza
 
03:36:03.030 --> 03:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
she um well anyways to get the public
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:09.520 --> 03:36:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:19.389 --> 03:36:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:24.710 --> 03:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:27.070 --> 03:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
apologize this bill would allow caucus
 
03:36:30.990 --> 03:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:33.469 --> 03:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
ballots if a caucus had at least five
 
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
members in the house they would be able
 
03:36:36.120 --> 03:36:37.070 align:start position:0%
members in the house they would be able
to

03:36:37.070 --> 03:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:36:39.550 --> 03:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
approve members of their caucus to be
 
03:36:42.790 --> 03:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
identified as such on ballots
 
03:36:45.269 --> 03:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
and this would also apply to the Senate
 
03:36:48.510 --> 03:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:50.830 --> 03:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
well the the reason for this is I think
 
03:36:52.630 --> 03:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
voters need more information deserve
 
03:36:53.990 --> 03:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
more information about who they're
 
03:36:57.110 --> 03:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
electing versus just the parties certain
 
03:36:59.070 --> 03:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
states allow Fusion voting which be
 
03:37:01.269 --> 03:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
allow the multiple listing of parties so
 
03:37:02.950 --> 03:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
you could run as a Republican and
 
03:37:05.189 --> 03:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
libertarian or whatever it may be this
 
03:37:07.630 --> 03:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
is a little bit different and I don't
 
03:37:09.229 --> 03:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
think people necessarily want to be in
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
two parties I think having multiple
 
03:37:15.229 --> 03:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
caucus um designations allow information
 
03:37:17.349 --> 03:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
to be given to the voters but also to
 
03:37:20.830 --> 03:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
allow candidates to transcend so-called
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
party lines but on issues so if it was a
 
03:37:25.269 --> 03:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
veterans caucus they could it could be a
 
03:37:27.070 --> 03:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
republican running with that as well as
 
03:37:31.550 --> 03:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
a Democrat and there's no conflict um I
 
03:37:33.309 --> 03:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
think it's pretty self-explanatory I'm
 
03:37:36.030 --> 03:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions to answer any
 
03:37:37.750 --> 03:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions and what where I was trying to
 
03:37:40.910 --> 03:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
go with this if there's confusion
 
03:37:43.469 --> 03:37:43.479 align:start position:0%
any questions representative
 
03:37:47.790 --> 03:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
Brennan thank you raise higher that time
 
03:37:50.950 --> 03:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
um I see in the bill that it mentions on
 
03:37:53.110 --> 03:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
line seven five members of the house
 
03:37:55.070 --> 03:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
shall be registered in a caucus with the
 
03:37:58.110 --> 03:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
house clerk for inclusion on such list
 
03:38:00.510 --> 03:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
and I see in the methodology here that a
 
03:38:03.070 --> 03:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
brief description of each caucus 140
 
03:38:05.110 --> 03:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
characters or fewer will accompany the
 
03:38:08.150 --> 03:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
ballot and I I guess what I'm wondering
 
03:38:10.830 --> 03:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
is is it not possible
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
that a group of five close colleagues
 
03:38:16.229 --> 03:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
could create a
 
03:38:16.239 --> 03:38:18.429 align:start position:0%
could create a
caucus

03:38:18.429 --> 03:38:18.439 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
03:38:21.110 --> 03:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
and you know that caucus could be you
 
03:38:23.670 --> 03:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
know registered on the ballot with those
 
03:38:26.790 --> 03:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
names and couldn't every
 
03:38:30.870 --> 03:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
five State reps create their own caucus
 
03:38:33.790 --> 03:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't that result in a ballot
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
that is multiple pages long with
 
03:38:37.790 --> 03:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
descriptions of different friend groups
 
03:38:40.950 --> 03:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
of five that we call a caucus
 
03:38:43.389 --> 03:38:43.399 align:start position:0%
is that not possible or I mean I suppose
 
03:38:44.790 --> 03:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
that would be possible but I think kind
 
03:38:46.429 --> 03:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
of defeats the purpose of what they'd be
 
03:38:49.229 --> 03:38:49.239 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish in a way point
 
03:38:51.910 --> 03:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
being is the more members of a caucus
 
03:38:53.830 --> 03:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
that existed the more significance it
 
03:38:55.150 --> 03:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
would have to the
 
03:38:57.349 --> 03:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
voters at as a whole do you know what
 
03:38:59.590 --> 03:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get at in sense I I
 
03:39:00.630 --> 03:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
understand you're saying it could be a
 
03:39:02.389 --> 03:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
political statement the you know
 
03:39:06.550 --> 03:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
whatever um I if that did occur to me
 
03:39:07.710 --> 03:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
afterwards and I was starting to really
 
03:39:09.710 --> 03:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
think about it I think there could be
 
03:39:12.469 --> 03:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
limitations if the threshold could be
 
03:39:14.630 --> 03:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
increased I suppose I just didn't want
 
03:39:17.229 --> 03:39:17.239 align:start position:0%
it to be something so excessive that you
 
03:39:20.070 --> 03:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't in a sense have some of the not
 
03:39:21.870 --> 03:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
Fringe elements but things that aren't
 
03:39:23.590 --> 03:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily everybody wants to be part
 
03:39:24.910 --> 03:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
of kind of groups something that
 
03:39:26.710 --> 03:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
actually represents something that some
 
03:39:28.309 --> 03:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
voters May care about but still
 
03:39:30.110 --> 03:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
significant enough that you're not going
 
03:39:32.510 --> 03:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
to get dozens and dozens of people
 
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
signing up
 
03:39:38.590 --> 03:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
for followup followup please um is it
 
03:39:41.349 --> 03:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
not the responsibility of the candidate
 
03:39:44.550 --> 03:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
to provide their voters with enough
 
03:39:47.950 --> 03:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
information about themselves during the
 
03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh election or primary
 
03:39:52.830 --> 03:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
process so that that voter can make an
 
03:39:55.229 --> 03:39:55.239 align:start position:0%
informed decision based on what the
 
03:39:57.590 --> 03:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
candidate has provided them rather than
 
03:40:00.269 --> 03:40:00.279 align:start position:0%
the ballot isn't it the candidates
 
03:40:02.790 --> 03:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility yes but I think many
 
03:40:04.990 --> 03:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
people say that they received too much
 
03:40:07.830 --> 03:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
political propaganda mail during
 
03:40:10.550 --> 03:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
campaign time I okay I don't know me as
 
03:40:12.229 --> 03:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
a blue collar kind of guy I don't the
 
03:40:14.110 --> 03:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
people that I'm around most of them
 
03:40:15.670 --> 03:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
don't vote and they'll tell you because
 
03:40:18.830 --> 03:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know who I'm voting for and I I
 
03:40:19.990 --> 03:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
actually respect that position way
 
03:40:21.389 --> 03:40:21.399 align:start position:0%
better than just going you
 
03:40:24.110 --> 03:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
know or people vote the party line which
 
03:40:26.670 --> 03:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
even though I'm part of a party I don't
 
03:40:28.389 --> 03:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
really believe in that policy I think
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
you should look at the candidates on
 
03:40:31.870 --> 03:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
their own merits and I think this helps
 
03:40:33.469 --> 03:40:33.479 align:start position:0%
this helps at least give a little bit
 
03:40:34.870 --> 03:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
more information especially with the
 
03:40:36.630 --> 03:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
description that would be on the ballot
 
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
itself I okay would it be a little bit
 
03:40:43.150 --> 03:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
more paper uh perhaps what the voter
 
03:40:44.750 --> 03:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
this is important I mean we're voting on
 
03:40:45.910 --> 03:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
people that are supposedly representing
 
03:40:48.189 --> 03:40:48.199 align:start position:0%
our interests let's find out who they if
 
03:40:51.189 --> 03:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
they have to pick three caucuses it now
 
03:40:53.030 --> 03:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
forces the candidate to say okay these
 
03:40:54.870 --> 03:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
are the three topics or and they don't
 
03:40:57.349 --> 03:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
have to join a caucus so be it but it at
 
03:40:59.269 --> 03:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
least kind of clarifies what this
 
03:41:02.910 --> 03:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
candidate is focused on versus just the
 
03:41:04.309 --> 03:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
the blue and the red or whatever you
 
03:41:07.229 --> 03:41:07.239 align:start position:0%
want to choose to go with representative
 
03:41:10.510 --> 03:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr chairman thank you take
 
03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
question five people well let's all get
 
03:41:16.830 --> 03:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
together and make a bunch of dummy
 
03:41:20.309 --> 03:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
caucuses just to get votes I mean
 
03:41:22.870 --> 03:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
nothing to prove that I'm for something
 
03:41:25.110 --> 03:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
or against something just that I put a
 
03:41:29.349 --> 03:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
name up say you know so anything just so
 
03:41:31.710 --> 03:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
I know those people like that whether or
 
03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
not I believe in that or not I don't
 
03:41:36.070 --> 03:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
care I would just want the vote so how
 
03:41:37.910 --> 03:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
what good is
 
03:41:41.469 --> 03:41:41.479 align:start position:0%
it um I would think that it would have
 
03:41:43.710 --> 03:41:43.720 align:start position:0%
to do with the caucus has a standing if
 
03:41:46.030 --> 03:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
they actually do what they believe so
 
03:41:47.309 --> 03:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
it'd be the same thing with Consumer
 
03:41:50.950 --> 03:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
Reports or other a um private entities
 
03:41:53.950 --> 03:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
that rate products if they lie they lose
 
03:41:56.429 --> 03:41:56.439 align:start position:0%
credibility they go out of business do
 
03:41:58.349 --> 03:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
you know I think your your it's your
 
03:42:00.750 --> 03:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
credibility that's at stake so the
 
03:42:01.990 --> 03:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
members that would be part of that
 
03:42:04.110 --> 03:42:04.120 align:start position:0%
caucus if they're fing just to be
 
03:42:06.070 --> 03:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
useless or they're endorsing people that
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
aren't fulfilling their their
 
03:42:08.960 --> 03:42:12.670 align:start position:0%
aren't fulfilling their their
so-called

03:42:12.670 --> 03:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:14.670 --> 03:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
no representative
 
03:42:18.349 --> 03:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
Mirad um I I sort of like your idea um I
 
03:42:19.830 --> 03:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of a concern about how
 
03:42:21.070 --> 03:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
the ballot would look have you thought
 
03:42:23.990 --> 03:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
about that
 
03:42:26.830 --> 03:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
yes well I'll let the co-sponsor take
 
03:42:30.349 --> 03:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
that question any further questions uh
 
03:42:32.469 --> 03:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
representative Arenberg anenberg ex me
 
03:42:33.870 --> 03:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just going I'm just butching
 
03:42:35.710 --> 03:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
everybody's names today it's all
 
03:42:38.590 --> 03:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
everybody's up on the table uh thank you
 
03:42:40.469 --> 03:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
representative uh I just have a question
 
03:42:43.950 --> 03:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
about um what is it line six here house
 
03:42:45.870 --> 03:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
caucus members shall submit a list of
 
03:42:49.110 --> 03:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
approved caucus members um
 
03:42:53.790 --> 03:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
MH so what if I wanted to be a member of
 
03:42:55.990 --> 03:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
a caucus and I was not an approved
 
03:42:58.950 --> 03:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
member is there an appeals process or
 
03:43:00.149 --> 03:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
and I guess where I'm going with this do
 
03:43:02.950 --> 03:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
you see a scenario by which not being an
 
03:43:05.429 --> 03:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
approved caucus member if I wanted to be
 
03:43:08.510 --> 03:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
a caucus member could create a problem
 
03:43:09.550 --> 03:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
well I think that's the whole idea of a
 
03:43:11.670 --> 03:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
caucus you control your membership keep
 
03:43:14.030 --> 03:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
the quality up
 
03:43:14.040 --> 03:43:15.590 align:start position:0%
the quality up
so

03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:20.149 --> 03:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
sure so you so you would believe that
 
03:43:23.389 --> 03:43:23.399 align:start position:0%
not every member of the house would be
 
03:43:25.790 --> 03:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
eligible to be a member of a caucus I
 
03:43:27.990 --> 03:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
think that's how it currently
 
03:43:31.429 --> 03:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
is okay I mean maybe I'm wrong but one
 
03:43:33.229 --> 03:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
more followup so would would this then
 
03:43:35.870 --> 03:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
be creating different classes of
 
03:43:38.070 --> 03:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
candidates on the ballot then because if
 
03:43:42.110 --> 03:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
you can exclude a member from being um
 
03:43:43.910 --> 03:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know if you can disclude membership
 
03:43:44.910 --> 03:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
of that
 
03:43:47.950 --> 03:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
caucus um aren't aren't isn't isn't that
 
03:43:49.990 --> 03:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
caucus then weighing in on the
 
03:43:52.149 --> 03:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
legitimacy of the candidate in in
 
03:43:54.670 --> 03:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
regards to caucus
 
03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
membership I would say that a caucus is
 
03:43:59.469 --> 03:43:59.479 align:start position:0%
a private entity the private entity can
 
03:44:01.189 --> 03:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
choose its
 
03:44:04.750 --> 03:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
members am I missing the rephrase it I'm
 
03:44:06.269 --> 03:44:06.279 align:start position:0%
confused I'm not really picking up what
 
03:44:09.030 --> 03:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
you're trying to say am iow yeah yeah
 
03:44:11.790 --> 03:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
sure yeah okay it's Tuesday why not so
 
03:44:14.229 --> 03:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
if if the the caucus members are
 
03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
submitting a list of approved caucus
 
03:44:19.269 --> 03:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
members yes and I wanted to be a member
 
03:44:22.309 --> 03:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
of the caucus and and you're saying no
 
03:44:25.309 --> 03:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
are then now the the caucus itself is
 
03:44:28.550 --> 03:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
taking the the place then of say the the
 
03:44:31.630 --> 03:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State um in what will
 
03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
appear on the ballot we I don't believe
 
03:44:35.469 --> 03:44:35.479 align:start position:0%
we do that in any other case because
 
03:44:37.349 --> 03:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
even like the the major parties and
 
03:44:40.349 --> 03:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
things like that there's a I guess we
 
03:44:41.590 --> 03:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
say we're we're adding something
 
03:44:44.309 --> 03:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
different to to the ballot that would be
 
03:44:46.670 --> 03:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
an ident a unique identifier to the to
 
03:44:48.309 --> 03:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
the candidate and their membership in
 
03:44:50.229 --> 03:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
something but then we're we're saying
 
03:44:52.790 --> 03:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
that there's another group that would
 
03:44:55.710 --> 03:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
then be saying yes or no right and like
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
even even the party itself doesn't do
 
03:45:00.110 --> 03:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
that right so are are aren't we then
 
03:45:02.830 --> 03:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
creating a different class of
 
03:45:05.990 --> 03:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
candidate I would yes I guess so but for
 
03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of providing an identifier
 
03:45:11.510 --> 03:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
that you are part of this group and it's
 
03:45:13.950 --> 03:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
yes so okay short answer be yes thank
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
you okay further questions from the
 
03:45:19.229 --> 03:45:19.239 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um I'm
 
03:45:22.309 --> 03:45:22.319 align:start position:0%

of the New Hampshire City and town
 
03:45:49.479 --> 03:45:50.469 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire City and town
clerks

03:45:50.469 --> 03:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
clerks
 
03:45:52.750 --> 03:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
Association and I just want to uh
 
03:45:58.110 --> 03:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
register with um the uh election law our
 
03:46:01.070 --> 03:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to this bill uh for
 
03:46:02.910 --> 03:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
numerous uh
 
03:46:06.469 --> 03:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
reasons um you know currently with the
 
03:46:08.990 --> 03:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
tabulators and larger communities we're
 
03:46:11.469 --> 03:46:11.479 align:start position:0%
finishing some elections 2 3 in the
 
03:46:14.110 --> 03:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
morning if we had to hand count all
 
03:46:17.870 --> 03:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
ballots uh cast in those elections we
 
03:46:20.550 --> 03:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
would be there well until the next day
 
03:46:23.950 --> 03:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh we're already working uh 24hour days
 
03:46:27.110 --> 03:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
some of us um I think other laws need to
 
03:46:29.870 --> 03:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
be changed to allow hand counting over a
 
03:46:32.189 --> 03:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
course of a few days it's not something
 
03:46:34.269 --> 03:46:34.279 align:start position:0%
that could then continue on Election
 
03:46:37.710 --> 03:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
night in in most larger communities with
 
03:46:40.429 --> 03:46:40.439 align:start position:0%
the tabulators again um I reported my
 
03:46:45.910 --> 03:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
results around 1:30 in the morning um
 
03:46:47.870 --> 03:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
and delivered them to our drop off
 
03:46:50.429 --> 03:46:50.439 align:start position:0%
location around 2:30 in the
 
03:46:53.389 --> 03:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
morning um all ballots being serial
 
03:46:58.710 --> 03:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
numbered um prevents um provides more
 
03:47:02.510 --> 03:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
more issues uh for us it says to that a
 
03:47:04.309 --> 03:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
voter can come in and retrieve their
 
03:47:06.590 --> 03:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
ballot the you know following the
 
03:47:09.389 --> 03:47:09.399 align:start position:0%
election the ballots have to be sealed
 
03:47:11.269 --> 03:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh with signatures from the moderator
 
03:47:13.550 --> 03:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
the clerk Selectmen they have the red
 
03:47:15.429 --> 03:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
security tape what would be the
 
03:47:17.670 --> 03:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
procedure then for opening those ballots
 
03:47:20.830 --> 03:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
those boxes up uh and retrieving those
 
03:47:23.590 --> 03:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
ballots because now they're not secure
 
03:47:26.790 --> 03:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh 24 24 hours a day
 
03:47:28.750 --> 03:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
surveillance um I don't think is
 
03:47:31.630 --> 03:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
realistic uh most communities to install
 
03:47:35.349 --> 03:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
a camera just pointed at the vaults uh
 
03:47:38.349 --> 03:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
who's monitoring that camera do we go in
 
03:47:41.070 --> 03:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
every day and watch the last you know
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
overnight what happened is it motion
 
03:47:46.389 --> 03:47:46.399 align:start position:0%
censored how are we monitoring that
 
03:47:49.149 --> 03:47:49.159 align:start position:0%
camera if there's a 24-hour uh camera on
 
03:47:49.159 --> 03:47:50.229 align:start position:0%
camera if there's a 24-hour uh camera on
those

03:47:50.229 --> 03:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:47:53.910 --> 03:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
ballots um just overall just looking at
 
03:47:56.469 --> 03:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
this bill there's there's just a ton of
 
03:47:59.349 --> 03:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
things in here that prevent that provide
 
03:48:03.710 --> 03:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
challenges for uh clerks they provide
 
03:48:06.910 --> 03:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
challenges it it uh for Secretary of
 
03:48:08.429 --> 03:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
State it
 
03:48:08.439 --> 03:48:10.030 align:start position:0%
State it
just

03:48:10.030 --> 03:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:48:12.070 --> 03:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure what this bill's trying
 
03:48:15.870 --> 03:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
to to accomplish um it just it seems to
 
03:48:15.880 --> 03:48:16.790 align:start position:0%
to to accomplish um it just it seems to
be

03:48:16.790 --> 03:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:48:20.950 --> 03:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
adding a lot of things that um that are
 
03:48:24.030 --> 03:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
going to be very hard if not impossible
 
03:48:27.070 --> 03:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
for us to to implement so i' be open to
 
03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions from the
 
03:48:30.550 --> 03:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you and my
 
03:48:33.870 --> 03:48:33.880 align:start position:0%

03:48:45.710 --> 03:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
on the record of course with that I'm
 
03:48:49.510 --> 03:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
going to reclose HB 1704 and reopen HB
 
03:48:51.910 --> 03:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
1699 um representative penzo was up next
 
03:48:54.309 --> 03:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
but I believe she has left the room uh
 
03:49:01.269 --> 03:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:03.469 --> 03:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
1699 thank you Mr chairman members of
 
03:49:04.990 --> 03:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm David scanland
 
03:49:08.510 --> 03:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and just like to talk
 
03:49:10.269 --> 03:49:10.279 align:start position:0%
to you a little bit about
 
03:49:13.790 --> 03:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh the ballots themselves in that the
 
03:49:15.950 --> 03:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
ballot is designed to treat every
 
03:49:19.349 --> 03:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
candidate on the ballot equally and not
 
03:49:22.550 --> 03:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
give any candidate you know any more
 
03:49:25.590 --> 03:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
visual influence uh than any other
 
03:49:28.710 --> 03:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
candidate on the ballot for example when
 
03:49:30.429 --> 03:49:30.439 align:start position:0%
a candidate lists their name on the
 
03:49:34.830 --> 03:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
ballot we do not allow terms like doctor
 
03:49:38.990 --> 03:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
Professor uh PhD coach uh because those
 
03:49:40.910 --> 03:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
are all designations that kind of
 
03:49:44.510 --> 03:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
elevate uh a person potentially in the
 
03:49:45.670 --> 03:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
eyes of the
 
03:49:49.550 --> 03:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
voter and then when we come to uh adding
 
03:49:53.030 --> 03:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
additional things on the ballot um yeah
 
03:49:55.269 --> 03:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
I just like to say that designing a
 
03:49:58.389 --> 03:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
ballot is a very complex process
 
03:49:59.870 --> 03:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
especially in New Hampshire where we
 
03:50:02.429 --> 03:50:02.439 align:start position:0%
have many many candidates and many many
 
03:50:05.710 --> 03:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
offices on the ballot and there are
 
03:50:08.670 --> 03:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
rotations of those columns and the names
 
03:50:10.870 --> 03:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
of candidates on the ballot that are
 
03:50:12.429 --> 03:50:12.439 align:start position:0%
required in
 
03:50:15.389 --> 03:50:15.399 align:start position:0%
statute so there are literally hundreds
 
03:50:18.070 --> 03:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
of different versions of ballots in any
 
03:50:21.189 --> 03:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
given election and they all have to be
 
03:50:24.229 --> 03:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
meticulously proofed to make sure that
 
03:50:26.110 --> 03:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
you know there is accurate as they can
 
03:50:28.830 --> 03:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
be and even with that you know sometimes
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
we find one or two misspelled names so
 
03:50:36.110 --> 03:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
to add additional designations like
 
03:50:40.590 --> 03:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
caucuses that um just makes that job a
 
03:50:41.550 --> 03:50:41.560 align:start position:0%
lot more
 
03:50:43.990 --> 03:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
complicated and then when you come
 
03:50:46.510 --> 03:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
specifically to state representative in
 
03:50:49.510 --> 03:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
addition to the rotations that I just
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned the the names of state
 
03:50:55.469 --> 03:50:55.479 align:start position:0%
representatives are staggered in their
 
03:50:58.309 --> 03:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
party columns to try and make it appear
 
03:51:01.750 --> 03:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
like uh those candidates are not running
 
03:51:04.349 --> 03:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
against specifically running against
 
03:51:07.309 --> 03:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
another candidate in the other party and
 
03:51:09.910 --> 03:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
so I can see um
 
03:51:13.030 --> 03:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
that field on the ballot growing pretty
 
03:51:15.790 --> 03:51:15.800 align:start position:0%
dramatically as a part of that process
 
03:51:18.269 --> 03:51:18.279 align:start position:0%
so my recommendation would be that there
 
03:51:20.590 --> 03:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
are other ways that candidates can
 
03:51:23.149 --> 03:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
advertise what groups they affiliate or
 
03:51:26.269 --> 03:51:26.279 align:start position:0%
belong to but it should not happen on
 
03:51:28.469 --> 03:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
the election ballot I'd be happy to
 
03:51:31.229 --> 03:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
answer any questions represent bum thank
 
03:51:33.469 --> 03:51:33.479 align:start position:0%
you m chairman than question and would
 
03:51:35.910 --> 03:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
it also mean extra work for Secretary of
 
03:51:40.590 --> 03:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
State's office to verify the caucuses
 
03:51:42.590 --> 03:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
well I I hadn't thought of that but you
 
03:51:43.990 --> 03:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
I suppose we would want to make sure
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
that they're registered with the house
 
03:51:50.309 --> 03:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
clerk further questions hearing none
 
03:51:52.349 --> 03:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um that was the last person
 
03:52:00.229 --> 03:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:03.070 --> 03:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
online guess
 
03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:08.080 --> 03:52:09.670 align:start position:0%
 
left

03:52:09.670 --> 03:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
left
 
03:52:10.910 --> 03:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
Miss Chester you're you're fine to come
 
03:52:14.910 --> 03:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:18.070 --> 03:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
you I'm so sorry um thank you committee
 
03:52:20.550 --> 03:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
chair thank you committee members um the
 
03:52:23.469 --> 03:52:23.479 align:start position:0%
only thing I want to say about this that
 
03:52:26.750 --> 03:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
I like is that again it gives us a level
 
03:52:29.990 --> 03:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
of transparency and accountability that
 
03:52:33.389 --> 03:52:33.399 align:start position:0%
we're missing in our elections uh we
 
03:52:36.990 --> 03:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
currently in our town um during a local
 
03:52:39.750 --> 03:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
election we had an indiv individual that
 
03:52:41.469 --> 03:52:41.479 align:start position:0%
go was going
 
03:52:44.229 --> 03:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
around um representing
 
03:52:49.309 --> 03:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
himself as uh as very different than
 
03:52:53.830 --> 03:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
what his what his belief system was and
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people that trust and
 
03:53:00.229 --> 03:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
don't verify unfortunately I used to
 
03:53:02.110 --> 03:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
think that New Hampshire was the New
 
03:53:05.750 --> 03:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire voters were uh pretty educated
 
03:53:08.429 --> 03:53:08.439 align:start position:0%
when it came to Casting their votes
 
03:53:11.110 --> 03:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
since becoming in more and more involved
 
03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
and actually um running for office I've
 
03:53:18.110 --> 03:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
learned that that's not always the case
 
03:53:19.870 --> 03:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason why I like this
 
03:53:23.189 --> 03:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
bill um specifically for local elections
 
03:53:26.750 --> 03:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
where it's not um where party
 
03:53:29.670 --> 03:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
designation is not identified having a
 
03:53:34.110 --> 03:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
caucus option uh for people would be
 
03:53:36.670 --> 03:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
very beneficial similar to like when
 
03:53:39.189 --> 03:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
we're running for State Rep we get we
 
03:53:42.550 --> 03:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
get um approved by nhla uh because we
 
03:53:46.349 --> 03:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
fill out uh we fill out um a
 
03:53:46.359 --> 03:53:48.389 align:start position:0%
fill out uh we fill out um a
uh

03:53:48.389 --> 03:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:53:53.110 --> 03:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh survey thank you very much uh so
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
we fill out surveys the bottom line is
 
03:53:58.510 --> 03:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
is any of these Co caucuses that were
 
03:54:01.149 --> 03:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
were to exist if that's how we become
 
03:54:04.349 --> 03:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
members of a caucus and if they if
 
03:54:04.359 --> 03:54:05.389 align:start position:0%
members of a caucus and if they if
they're

03:54:05.389 --> 03:54:05.399 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:54:09.070 --> 03:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
not honest if they're if the part if the
 
03:54:13.389 --> 03:54:13.399 align:start position:0%
members of that caucus are not walking
 
03:54:17.070 --> 03:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
the walk then it's going to be apparent
 
03:54:20.309 --> 03:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
the first first election cycle and they
 
03:54:22.710 --> 03:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
won't get reelected and I think that's
 
03:54:25.590 --> 03:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
why it's important at least for local
 
03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
elections I think it's very helpful for
 
03:54:31.830 --> 03:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
our voters um especially with the with
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
regards to State reps Senators executive
 
03:54:38.070 --> 03:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
counsels Etc um the bottom line is is
 
03:54:40.910 --> 03:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
the one with the most money often gets
 
03:54:43.269 --> 03:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
the most votes and unfortunately it
 
03:54:47.110 --> 03:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be that way but it is because
 
03:54:49.750 --> 03:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
mainstream media
 
03:54:55.229 --> 03:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
controls so much of what our vote is is
 
03:54:58.750 --> 03:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
telling to the people of New
 
03:55:01.349 --> 03:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's it I'll take any
 
03:55:03.670 --> 03:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the committee
 
03:55:05.710 --> 03:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
okay hearing none thank you all right
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
now we will close um 1699
 
03:55:11.229 --> 03:55:11.239 align:start position:0%
uh online there were 32 signed up in
 
03:55:14.030 --> 03:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
support 16 opposed one neutral uh the
 
03:55:16.229 --> 03:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
committee will stand in recess until 2:
 
03:55:30.030 --> 03:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.800 --> 03:56:07.710 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:56:07.710 --> 03:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:07.720 --> 04:01:34.070 align:start position:0%
 
on

04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:37.429 --> 04:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
okay it's 2 o' I'm going to open up the
 
04:01:40.429 --> 04:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
house house election law committee
 
04:01:43.349 --> 04:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
public hearing on hb1 1426 in
 
04:01:45.189 --> 04:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
consultation with the designated ranking
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
member today we do have many people
 
04:01:47.750 --> 04:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak for this so I will be
 
04:01:50.550 --> 04:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
limiting public testimony per individual
 
04:01:52.269 --> 04:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
uh with five minutes I did consult with
 
04:01:53.630 --> 04:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
the ranking member on that to reach
 
04:01:56.269 --> 04:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
consent um with that representative
 
04:01:58.429 --> 04:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
Mirad you are recognized thank you Mr
 
04:02:03.870 --> 04:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:05.950 --> 04:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
enough he's been waiting for two years
 
04:02:11.229 --> 04:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:13.269 --> 04:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
but it's to do that today would be
 
04:02:14.830 --> 04:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
particularly unfair because I'm not
 
04:02:17.189 --> 04:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
speaking simply for myself but for the
 
04:02:19.990 --> 04:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
estimable representative Lane who is the
 
04:02:22.229 --> 04:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor of this bill and who's
 
04:02:24.189 --> 04:02:24.199 align:start position:0%
asked me to speak on her behalf this
 
04:02:26.510 --> 04:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
morning this bill would establish an
 
04:02:28.910 --> 04:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
independent redistricting commission to
 
04:02:30.990 --> 04:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
draw District boundaries for the State
 
04:02:32.830 --> 04:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
House the state senate State executive
 
04:02:35.429 --> 04:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
Council County Commissioners and the
 
04:02:38.229 --> 04:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
congressional districts in the year 2031
 
04:02:40.870 --> 04:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
1 the excellent thing is that sitting
 
04:02:43.630 --> 04:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
here s years away we do not know which
 
04:02:44.910 --> 04:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
party will be in the majority in the
 
04:02:46.110 --> 04:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
legislature in
 
04:02:48.510 --> 04:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
2031 and so this isn't a bill that's
 
04:02:51.269 --> 04:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
meant to penalize uh e either side by
 
04:02:52.950 --> 04:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
the way there'll be a kind of midterm
 
04:02:56.070 --> 04:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
presidential election I think in 2028 so
 
04:02:58.030 --> 04:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
my guess is that whichever party does
 
04:02:59.670 --> 04:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
not control the US Presidency will
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
probably benefit in 2030 and control the
 
04:03:03.750 --> 04:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
legislature hard to predict which party
 
04:03:05.229 --> 04:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
that'll be right now it's impossible
 
04:03:08.349 --> 04:03:08.359 align:start position:0%
actually so the basic idea here to
 
04:03:11.429 --> 04:03:11.439 align:start position:0%
create a commission nine people three
 
04:03:13.870 --> 04:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
Democrats three Republicans three
 
04:03:16.670 --> 04:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
Independents and have that commission
 
04:03:20.309 --> 04:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
with the staff create Maps hold public
 
04:03:22.189 --> 04:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
meetings deliberate about those maps and
 
04:03:23.670 --> 04:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
recommend a set of maps to the
 
04:03:25.870 --> 04:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
legislature to make a recommendation
 
04:03:27.389 --> 04:03:27.399 align:start position:0%
seven people on that nine member
 
04:03:29.070 --> 04:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
commission would have to agree so
 
04:03:30.550 --> 04:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
imagine just by chance that the
 
04:03:32.469 --> 04:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
Republicans and the independent stick
 
04:03:34.110 --> 04:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
together maybe their Republican leaning
 
04:03:36.110 --> 04:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
Independence those six people wouldn't
 
04:03:37.550 --> 04:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
be enough to make a recommendation they
 
04:03:40.510 --> 04:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
need at least one Democrat to join them
 
04:03:42.030 --> 04:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
put differently you need at least one
 
04:03:43.309 --> 04:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
from each of these three groups
 
04:03:44.950 --> 04:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
Democrats Independents and Republicans
 
04:03:49.349 --> 04:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
to get to seven and and um and and the
 
04:03:51.110 --> 04:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
legislature has the power to accept
 
04:03:53.229 --> 04:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
those maps that recommendation or design
 
04:03:55.990 --> 04:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
its own legislature is constitutionally
 
04:03:58.389 --> 04:03:58.399 align:start position:0%
empowered to to draw its own District
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
Maps so it's an advisory commission to
 
04:04:02.429 --> 04:04:02.439 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the basic underlying
 
04:04:05.429 --> 04:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
intuition is that maps that all the
 
04:04:07.349 --> 04:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
relevant parties Dems Independence
 
04:04:09.389 --> 04:04:09.399 align:start position:0%
Republicans age on are going to be more
 
04:04:11.590 --> 04:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
fair Maps the maps that just one party
 
04:04:14.110 --> 04:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
agrees on and that the other party or
 
04:04:16.189 --> 04:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
parties vigorously opposed that's the
 
04:04:18.269 --> 04:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
basic idea the basic idea is that more
 
04:04:21.990 --> 04:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
fair maps are better than than maps that
 
04:04:23.910 --> 04:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
some large chunk of the population views
 
04:04:30.670 --> 04:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
as unfair and uh and and uh my students
 
04:04:32.830 --> 04:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
young people today I mean I they they
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
they really are extraordinarily
 
04:04:36.750 --> 04:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
skeptical about the formal institutions
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
of constitutional democracy it makes me
 
04:04:40.309 --> 04:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
worry about the future and they think
 
04:04:41.830 --> 04:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's you know corrupt whether they're on
 
04:04:43.950 --> 04:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
the right whether on the most of them
 
04:04:45.149 --> 04:04:45.159 align:start position:0%
are kind of just in the center they're
 
04:04:47.910 --> 04:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
not super ideological on the left they
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
they think this and they think it's not
 
04:04:51.630 --> 04:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
good to have partisans draw maps to
 
04:04:53.670 --> 04:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
favor their own party that just strikes
 
04:04:56.990 --> 04:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
them as unfair and this is an effort to
 
04:04:59.870 --> 04:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
to get the parties to come together to
 
04:05:01.830 --> 04:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh see if they can make a recommendation
 
04:05:03.510 --> 04:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
that everybody agrees to and that that's
 
04:05:05.830 --> 04:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
the plan that's the bill um and it makes
 
04:05:07.630 --> 04:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of intuitive sense to me even
 
04:05:08.910 --> 04:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
though I'm not actually the prime
 
04:05:11.070 --> 04:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor happy to take
 
04:05:13.469 --> 04:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:05:15.510 --> 04:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
bone thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
taking the question my problem is the
 
04:05:22.389 --> 04:05:22.399 align:start position:0%
same as in the past is what's an
 
04:05:25.550 --> 04:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
independent nobody's independent
 
04:05:27.550 --> 04:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
everybody's got a bias one way or
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
another so that's been over the years
 
04:05:31.830 --> 04:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
the commissions that we've tried to done
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
that's always been defeated has always
 
04:05:36.389 --> 04:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
been that what's an independent so how
 
04:05:39.910 --> 04:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
can you find a real
 
04:05:42.030 --> 04:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
independent yeah I'm with you the well
 
04:05:44.189 --> 04:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
the the word independent comes into this
 
04:05:46.030 --> 04:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
bill in two different ways one is that
 
04:05:48.349 --> 04:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
the The Advisory commission has nine
 
04:05:50.790 --> 04:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
people three registered Republicans
 
04:05:52.149 --> 04:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
three registered Democrats three
 
04:05:53.870 --> 04:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
registered Independents by the way
 
04:05:56.110 --> 04:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
they're chosen from retired a group of
 
04:05:59.469 --> 04:05:59.479 align:start position:0%
four retired uh state judges but I agree
 
04:06:00.590 --> 04:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
with you so those registered
 
04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
Independents I I think just speaking as
 
04:06:05.229 --> 04:06:05.239 align:start position:0%
a political scientist which I played
 
04:06:07.870 --> 04:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
during the day um it's true that most
 
04:06:09.590 --> 04:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
most Independents lean toward one party
 
04:06:12.510 --> 04:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
to the other pretty reliably um and so
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
they're kind of closet Republicans
 
04:06:15.670 --> 04:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
closet Democrats so let's just imagine
 
04:06:17.510 --> 04:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
that the three Independents are all
 
04:06:19.870 --> 04:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
Republican leaning and you've got three
 
04:06:21.790 --> 04:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
Republicans and three Republican leaning
 
04:06:23.910 --> 04:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
Independents they ain't got six people
 
04:06:25.630 --> 04:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
who are kind of more sympathetic to the
 
04:06:26.950 --> 04:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
Republican party than the Democratic
 
04:06:28.229 --> 04:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
party as a Democrat I could say well
 
04:06:30.269 --> 04:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
that's unfair but for the committee to
 
04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation at least one of
 
04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
these three Democrats to get to seven
 
04:06:36.070 --> 04:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
one of the three Dems on this nine
 
04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
person committee is also going to have
 
04:06:40.110 --> 04:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
to join the other six and and I think
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
that's the check against the possibility
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
that The Independents won't you know
 
04:06:45.389 --> 04:06:45.399 align:start position:0%
will lean one way the other as a whole
 
04:06:47.830 --> 04:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
group um we could also amend the bill so
 
04:06:49.349 --> 04:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
that it's all you know it's five Dems
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
and five Republican or you know five I
 
04:06:53.950 --> 04:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
guess you can't do five and four so I
 
04:06:55.590 --> 04:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
like the
 
04:06:57.710 --> 04:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
333 but I think that's the key thing
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
then the other idea of independent is
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
that it's making an independent
 
04:07:03.349 --> 04:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation and there I think all we
 
04:07:05.110 --> 04:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
mean is that it's a recommendation that
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
the that both sides agree on it's not
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:15.830 --> 04:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
bipartisan further questions BR can you
 
04:07:18.510 --> 04:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
speak to um the adoption of
 
04:07:22.510 --> 04:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
redistricting maps on the page five
 
04:07:25.870 --> 04:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
starting in line 10 and discuss
 
04:07:29.469 --> 04:07:29.479 align:start position:0%
what the implication is of this
 
04:07:32.670 --> 04:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
commission the maps that they
 
04:07:36.910 --> 04:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
submit if the legislature must accept
 
04:07:38.750 --> 04:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
the maps or what
 
04:07:41.630 --> 04:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
happens with the suggested maps from
 
04:07:41.640 --> 04:07:42.389 align:start position:0%
happens with the suggested maps from
this

04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:07:45.070 --> 04:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
commission the recommend the the
 
04:07:46.830 --> 04:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
commission would make a recommendation
 
04:07:49.269 --> 04:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
to the legislature the authority of the
 
04:07:50.710 --> 04:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be based on the
 
04:07:52.349 --> 04:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
deliberation that the commission put in
 
04:07:53.790 --> 04:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
and the fact that all the relevant
 
04:07:55.990 --> 04:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
groups agree such that they could get to
 
04:07:57.990 --> 04:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
seven people a majority of seven out of
 
04:08:00.149 --> 04:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
nine people but the legislature doesn't
 
04:08:01.870 --> 04:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
have to accept the maps the
 
04:08:04.189 --> 04:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
legislature um may find that there are
 
04:08:05.870 --> 04:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
problems with them and legislature is
 
04:08:08.910 --> 04:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
constitutionally empowered to decide for
 
04:08:10.910 --> 04:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
itself whether to accept this
 
04:08:13.990 --> 04:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation or um or create an
 
04:08:18.070 --> 04:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:21.389 --> 04:08:21.399 align:start position:0%
plan further questions from the
 
04:08:24.990 --> 04:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
committee you still have uh 45 minutes
 
04:08:29.030 --> 04:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
so he wrote 90 minutes on his card uh
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:08:36.510 --> 04:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
Mirad um okay next up here let me see
 
04:08:44.309 --> 04:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:46.590 --> 04:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
Hatcher and as they say Mr Hatcher you
 
04:08:48.189 --> 04:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
are on the
 
04:08:51.030 --> 04:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
clock thank you I'm Bill Hatcher I'm
 
04:08:53.910 --> 04:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
from Dober see my representative Bay
 
04:08:56.750 --> 04:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
here today
 
04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
um so I was a member of the mapathon
 
04:09:04.269 --> 04:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
citizens mapping project so I'm very
 
04:09:06.750 --> 04:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
well aware of the kind of Technical and
 
04:09:11.070 --> 04:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
legal acies of drawing the maps um and I
 
04:09:13.830 --> 04:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
believe it's would be wise to delegate a
 
04:09:19.349 --> 04:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
group to do the task um because the
 
04:09:21.429 --> 04:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
legislature as you guys well know is
 
04:09:22.830 --> 04:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed every year with when the
 
04:09:25.429 --> 04:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
order of a thousand bills to
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
do um and also frankly you're under um
 
04:09:32.790 --> 04:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
political pressure when you're drawing
 
04:09:35.830 --> 04:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
Maps which I think is probably not best
 
04:09:38.710 --> 04:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
for the state in terms of coming up with
 
04:09:41.389 --> 04:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
districts that are best
 
04:09:44.790 --> 04:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
represent the citizens of the
 
04:09:47.349 --> 04:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
state so that's my first point second
 
04:09:49.590 --> 04:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
point is I think we can all agree the
 
04:09:52.630 --> 04:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
process that we're using is not working
 
04:09:56.590 --> 04:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
very well unless you're a fan of the
 
04:09:59.910 --> 04:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
judicial system drawing Maps if we go
 
04:10:00.870 --> 04:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
back to
 
04:10:03.269 --> 04:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
2000 the governor and the legislature
 
04:10:06.189 --> 04:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
disagreed on the house and the Senate
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
Maps so so Supreme Court had to get
 
04:10:12.550 --> 04:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
involved get a technical person to
 
04:10:13.910 --> 04:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
actually draw the
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
maps that didn't go so well if you
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
remember um that person decided not to
 
04:10:19.439 --> 04:10:20.309 align:start position:0%
remember um that person decided not to
use

04:10:20.309 --> 04:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
use
 
04:10:20.319 --> 04:10:21.830 align:start position:0%
use
fluer

04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
fluer
 
04:10:24.429 --> 04:10:24.439 align:start position:0%
districts we ended up with big
 
04:10:27.149 --> 04:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
districts many towns lost their
 
04:10:27.159 --> 04:10:28.590 align:start position:0%
districts many towns lost their
dedicated

04:10:28.590 --> 04:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
04:10:30.670 --> 04:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives this led to an amendment
 
04:10:34.229 --> 04:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:37.429 --> 04:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
2006 to provide try to better provide
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated representation to towns of
 
04:10:39.239 --> 04:10:40.950 align:start position:0%
dedicated representation to towns of
adequate

04:10:40.950 --> 04:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
04:10:43.870 --> 04:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
size that init is under litigation now
 
04:10:47.550 --> 04:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:50.950 --> 04:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:52.870 --> 04:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
2010 again the governor and the
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
legislature disagreed on the
 
04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
maps however the legislature had a super
 
04:10:59.710 --> 04:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
majority at the time and they overrode
 
04:11:02.269 --> 04:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
the governor's
 
04:11:04.750 --> 04:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
veto so you might CL you know might
 
04:11:06.510 --> 04:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
realize that okay we were saved that
 
04:11:08.990 --> 04:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
time by super majority in A legislature
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
there was still extensive litigation it
 
04:11:15.750 --> 04:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
was all eventually dismissed however um
 
04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
20120 we had one party in control of
 
04:11:22.349 --> 04:11:22.359 align:start position:0%
all of both the governorship and
 
04:11:24.149 --> 04:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
legislature but
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
still the governor and the legislature
 
04:11:29.389 --> 04:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree on the Congressional Maps
 
04:11:30.630 --> 04:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
so what
 
04:11:32.990 --> 04:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
happened Judicial System drew the
 
04:11:33.000 --> 04:11:34.670 align:start position:0%
happened Judicial System drew the
Congressional

04:11:34.670 --> 04:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
Congressional
 
04:11:34.680 --> 04:11:36.349 align:start position:0%
Congressional
Maps

04:11:36.349 --> 04:11:36.359 align:start position:0%
Maps
 
04:11:36.359 --> 04:11:38.309 align:start position:0%
Maps
okay

04:11:38.309 --> 04:11:38.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:11:40.229 --> 04:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
so where are we headed is this is this
 
04:11:41.349 --> 04:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
what is
 
04:11:44.590 --> 04:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
this good is the legislature and act
 
04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
actuality actually drawing the maps in
 
04:11:46.399 --> 04:11:47.309 align:start position:0%
actuality actually drawing the maps in
many

04:11:47.309 --> 04:11:47.319 align:start position:0%
many
 
04:11:49.070 --> 04:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
cases um
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
no um looking ahead to 2030 you
 
04:11:54.870 --> 04:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
know what's going to be the situation
 
04:11:58.109 --> 04:11:58.119 align:start position:0%
and we're a purple state right it seems
 
04:12:00.269 --> 04:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
unlikely that one party is going to
 
04:12:02.070 --> 04:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
control all
 
04:12:06.309 --> 04:12:06.319 align:start position:0%
three important entities here um it
 
04:12:07.870 --> 04:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
seems even more unlik
 
04:12:10.550 --> 04:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
ly that a party will have a super
 
04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
majority in the
 
04:12:14.229 --> 04:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
legislature so what's likely to happen
 
04:12:16.750 --> 04:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
in 2030 if we continue doing what we've
 
04:12:16.760 --> 04:12:18.349 align:start position:0%
in 2030 if we continue doing what we've
been

04:12:18.349 --> 04:12:18.359 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:12:20.670 --> 04:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
doing the courts are going to draw the
 
04:12:24.550 --> 04:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.750 --> 04:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
want I don't think so so I would ask you
 
04:12:30.830 --> 04:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
to consider this bill and and I know
 
04:12:32.109 --> 04:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
there's there's a constitutional
 
04:12:34.990 --> 04:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
amendment coming forward also you I ask
 
04:12:36.030 --> 04:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
you to
 
04:12:38.670 --> 04:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
consider that we're not actually doing
 
04:12:42.550 --> 04:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
what we think we're doing okay and to
 
04:12:43.830 --> 04:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
finish up I just want to add a
 
04:12:49.590 --> 04:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
historical note I have a copy of the um
 
04:12:52.389 --> 04:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
pole tax receipt that my grandfather
 
04:12:53.550 --> 04:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
received in
 
04:12:56.510 --> 04:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
1908 in mlon County
 
04:12:59.109 --> 04:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
Texas and now you know we look back in
 
04:13:00.630 --> 04:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
those times and we
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
think it's embarrassing right it's
 
04:13:06.510 --> 04:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
embarrassing that we used a p tech
 
04:13:09.149 --> 04:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
mechanism to keep people from
 
04:13:12.349 --> 04:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
voting um I think 100 years from now
 
04:13:13.590 --> 04:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
people are going to look back on this
 
04:13:16.109 --> 04:13:16.119 align:start position:0%
era and they're going to be embarrassed
 
04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
that we didn't fix this problem with
 
04:13:19.950 --> 04:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
Jerry mandering we know it happens both
 
04:13:21.229 --> 04:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
parties do
 
04:13:21.239 --> 04:13:23.269 align:start position:0%
parties do
it

04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:13:26.429 --> 04:13:26.439 align:start position:0%
right citizens through polling don't
 
04:13:26.439 --> 04:13:27.910 align:start position:0%
right citizens through polling don't
like

04:13:27.910 --> 04:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:13:31.590 --> 04:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
it we have you know 21 states have done
 
04:13:33.550 --> 04:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
a commission or something like
 
04:13:36.030 --> 04:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
it I would strongly recommend and I hope
 
04:13:37.750 --> 04:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
you would seriously consider adding New
 
04:13:39.389 --> 04:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to that list of
 
04:13:41.710 --> 04:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
states thank
 
04:13:45.149 --> 04:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
you nailed it 12 seconds left
 
04:13:48.590 --> 04:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
um any questions from the committee okay
 
04:13:51.950 --> 04:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
hearing none thank you Mr
 
04:13:54.750 --> 04:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
Hatcher all right Mr Andrews it's good
 
04:14:00.349 --> 04:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:03.510 --> 04:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
you hi uh my name is David Andrews I
 
04:14:06.790 --> 04:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
live in conquer now um I worked as a
 
04:14:08.950 --> 04:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
data analyst for the redistricting data
 
04:14:10.830 --> 04:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
Hub I was the lead mapper for the
 
04:14:15.149 --> 04:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
mapathon um project and I am the uh
 
04:14:17.229 --> 04:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
expert witness in the Dober lawsuit
 
04:14:21.590 --> 04:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
challenging the New Hampshire house Maps
 
04:14:24.910 --> 04:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
um the current process of redistricting
 
04:14:28.349 --> 04:14:28.359 align:start position:0%
in this state and in this country is a
 
04:14:31.389 --> 04:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
crack in the found Foundation of our
 
04:14:31.399 --> 04:14:33.469 align:start position:0%
crack in the found Foundation of our
democracy

04:14:33.469 --> 04:14:33.479 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
04:14:37.790 --> 04:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
um we have not done a very good job job
 
04:14:40.950 --> 04:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
in creating fair and Equitable districts
 
04:14:43.349 --> 04:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
04:14:46.950 --> 04:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
um all of the maps besides the
 
04:14:49.189 --> 04:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
Congressional map are Jerry mannered to
 
04:14:50.429 --> 04:14:50.439 align:start position:0%
favor one
 
04:14:54.630 --> 04:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
party in this voters from both parties
 
04:14:54.640 --> 04:14:55.590 align:start position:0%
party in this voters from both parties
are

04:14:55.590 --> 04:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:14:58.590 --> 04:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised we create safe districts
 
04:15:01.510 --> 04:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
for both parties and thus we move our
 
04:15:04.030 --> 04:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
elections from the general election to
 
04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
the primaries this creates
 
04:15:11.830 --> 04:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
officials who are further to the
 
04:15:13.830 --> 04:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
extremes of each party than to the
 
04:15:17.309 --> 04:15:17.319 align:start position:0%
center which is um in my opinion what
 
04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:27.910 --> 04:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
like the this creates less bipartisan
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
agreement um it creates more
 
04:15:34.630 --> 04:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
animosity and it is not helping our
 
04:15:39.750 --> 04:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
democracy to be its best self um
 
04:15:41.950 --> 04:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
so the idea of an independent
 
04:15:43.830 --> 04:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission is something
 
04:15:45.109 --> 04:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
that I
 
04:15:49.750 --> 04:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly um want and
 
04:15:53.630 --> 04:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
support this bill however is not ideal
 
04:15:58.229 --> 04:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
in some ways um I believe that the uh
 
04:15:59.830 --> 04:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
that a constitutional amendment is
 
04:16:02.389 --> 04:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
required in order to you know guarantee
 
04:16:05.070 --> 04:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
our rights as voters to fair and
 
04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
Equitable um
 
04:16:11.309 --> 04:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
maps and also within this bill I see
 
04:16:14.550 --> 04:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
some flaws
 
04:16:19.550 --> 04:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
um one of which is the idea of um
 
04:16:24.830 --> 04:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
compactness being a uh ideal of this
 
04:16:27.550 --> 04:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
commission it's not necessarily
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
something that
 
04:16:34.670 --> 04:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
is needed or can be agreed upon in
 
04:16:36.389 --> 04:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different ways in order
 
04:16:38.670 --> 04:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
to calculate compactness not everyone
 
04:16:40.830 --> 04:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
agrees on what they are and they're not
 
04:16:44.309 --> 04:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
always good yes you can sometimes look
 
04:16:46.710 --> 04:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
at a map and say that might be Jerry
 
04:16:49.309 --> 04:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
mandard because it looks very funky but
 
04:16:51.750 --> 04:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
there's also other reasons why a map may
 
04:16:54.550 --> 04:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
look funky um and may not have super
 
04:16:57.429 --> 04:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
compact districts for instance um let's
 
04:16:59.750 --> 04:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
say you wanted to use school districts
 
04:17:01.870 --> 04:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
as a community of Interest so you wanted
 
04:17:03.790 --> 04:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
to keep School District together our
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
school districts are not compact they
 
04:17:08.790 --> 04:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
are some sometimes funky shaped so then
 
04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
you get funky shaped districts out of it
 
04:17:14.109 --> 04:17:14.119 align:start position:0%
and not compact districts um so in that
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
regard I
 
04:17:18.349 --> 04:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
would I would uh recommend that you you
 
04:17:20.990 --> 04:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
know maybe amend to kind of get rid of
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
the compactness element of this bill uh
 
04:17:25.199 --> 04:17:26.830 align:start position:0%
the compactness element of this bill uh
again

04:17:26.830 --> 04:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:17:31.590 --> 04:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not a huge fan of the the 333 um
 
04:17:35.349 --> 04:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
because it's again it doesn't seem as
 
04:17:37.790 --> 04:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan as it could be i' like the
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
model of um 555 and thus having three
 
04:17:44.870 --> 04:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
members of
 
04:17:47.469 --> 04:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
each having to be able to vote on it so
 
04:17:49.830 --> 04:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
you'd have you know You' need nine
 
04:17:52.149 --> 04:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
people to vote on a map to get it passed
 
04:17:54.149 --> 04:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
three Republicans three Democrats three
 
04:17:55.950 --> 04:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
Independents and therefore you get the
 
04:17:58.189 --> 04:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
majority of each party rather than you
 
04:18:01.750 --> 04:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
know just one you may have you know a
 
04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
moderate Republican who sides with all
 
04:18:05.670 --> 04:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
of the Democrats and all The
 
04:18:08.189 --> 04:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
Independents you know want that you want
 
04:18:13.389 --> 04:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
a majority of each uh party to agree
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
upon these Maps
 
04:18:20.429 --> 04:18:20.439 align:start position:0%
um and then um no offense but I think
 
04:18:24.229 --> 04:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has shown itself to
 
04:18:28.269 --> 04:18:28.279 align:start position:0%
uh not be trustworthy enough to be able
 
04:18:30.429 --> 04:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
to be a pro part of this process and
 
04:18:31.830 --> 04:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
therefore I think it needs to be
 
04:18:34.590 --> 04:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
independent of the legislature and the
 
04:18:36.710 --> 04:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
legislature should not be able to over
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
deride a map uh of a independent
 
04:18:43.790 --> 04:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
redistri commission um we've seen in a
 
04:18:45.750 --> 04:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
number of states that have similar bills
 
04:18:48.349 --> 04:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
to this um New York
 
04:18:52.429 --> 04:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
Ohio uh Florida um where the legislature
 
04:18:54.830 --> 04:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
has ignored the wills of Voters who want
 
04:18:57.910 --> 04:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
Fair redistricting and has thrown out
 
04:19:00.030 --> 04:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
maps and gone with their own Jerry
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
manard maps and it hasn't really fixed
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
the problem I fear that this uh bill is
 
04:19:07.550 --> 04:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
actually kind of just moving the bucket
 
04:19:10.389 --> 04:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
rather than fixing the leak and so I
 
04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
would um although I am in support of
 
04:19:14.870 --> 04:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
this bill because I think it's a step in
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
the right direction I think that it
 
04:19:20.469 --> 04:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
needs to be a a step further and a
 
04:19:22.030 --> 04:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment needs to be
 
04:19:26.349 --> 04:19:26.359 align:start position:0%
brought forth I know it is but um and
 
04:19:29.389 --> 04:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm happy to take any questions and
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
you too nailed your time 14 seconds left
 
04:19:33.710 --> 04:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
um questions from the committee
 
04:19:33.720 --> 04:19:35.030 align:start position:0%
um questions from the committee
representative

04:19:35.030 --> 04:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:19:37.309 --> 04:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
Brennan thank you
 
04:19:39.269 --> 04:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
just to make sure I'm understanding your
 
04:19:42.030 --> 04:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
testimony you are in support of this
 
04:19:45.149 --> 04:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
bill because it takes a small step
 
04:19:47.670 --> 04:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
forward toward an end goal of an
 
04:19:50.429 --> 04:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
independent redistricting Commission in
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
your mind that would eliminate the
 
04:19:55.070 --> 04:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
legislature from the process but this
 
04:19:56.710 --> 04:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
would be a step in the right direction
 
04:19:58.309 --> 04:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
is that am I understanding your
 
04:20:00.389 --> 04:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
testimony correctly yes yes correct um
 
04:20:03.189 --> 04:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
you know our the mapathon project tried
 
04:20:04.710 --> 04:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
to emulate what this would this
 
04:20:07.510 --> 04:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
commission would actually do um we put
 
04:20:10.349 --> 04:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
forth Fair Maps um we brought them
 
04:20:12.429 --> 04:20:12.439 align:start position:0%
before you know members of the public
 
04:20:14.429 --> 04:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
who commented on them
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
we then submitted them to the
 
04:20:20.670 --> 04:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
legislature and were um
 
04:20:20.680 --> 04:20:25.229 align:start position:0%
legislature and were um
ignored

04:20:25.229 --> 04:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:27.910 --> 04:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
so resident
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
we thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:20:34.910 --> 04:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um what were the
 
04:20:37.389 --> 04:20:37.399 align:start position:0%
distinguishing attributes between
 
04:20:41.229 --> 04:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
between what was proposed by your group
 
04:20:43.790 --> 04:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
and the other
 
04:20:46.269 --> 04:20:46.279 align:start position:0%
redistrict uh Maps was there an
 
04:20:49.229 --> 04:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
attribute or some quality that that made
 
04:20:52.389 --> 04:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
them uh set apart and unique from the
 
04:20:56.109 --> 04:20:56.119 align:start position:0%
others um yes so uh depending on the
 
04:20:59.670 --> 04:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
level of uh the legislative map for
 
04:21:01.750 --> 04:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
instance um you know for the New
 
04:21:04.109 --> 04:21:04.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house Maps we tried to strive
 
04:21:07.790 --> 04:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
to create as many um single member uh
 
04:21:10.030 --> 04:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
districts as possible or not single me
 
04:21:14.229 --> 04:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
but um single town or Ward districts as
 
04:21:16.269 --> 04:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
possible in order to comply with the
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
2006 Amendment saying that eligible
 
04:21:20.510 --> 04:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
towns or Wards should have their own
 
04:21:24.070 --> 04:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
districts um so we were able to create a
 
04:21:26.149 --> 04:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
map that had 41 towns that didn't get
 
04:21:28.510 --> 04:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
their own districts rather than the 55
 
04:21:31.349 --> 04:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
towns that didn't in the current house
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
Maps um in other Maps we strive to
 
04:21:38.030 --> 04:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
commet to keep communities of Interest
 
04:21:41.469 --> 04:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
together um like uh we used uh school
 
04:21:45.309 --> 04:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
districts for one example uh we also try
 
04:21:49.149 --> 04:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
we also kind of ignored the um incumbent
 
04:21:52.149 --> 04:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
advantage that they used when creating
 
04:21:54.269 --> 04:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
the the New Hampshire Senate Maps where
 
04:21:55.710 --> 04:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
they said explicitly that they were
 
04:21:58.189 --> 04:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
creating these and they weren't moving
 
04:22:00.389 --> 04:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
um incumbents out of their districts
 
04:22:02.349 --> 04:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
unless they had already moved or
 
04:22:05.990 --> 04:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
whatever was the case um with District 2
 
04:22:08.830 --> 04:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
or whatever but
 
04:22:11.469 --> 04:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
yeah let's um keep questions relative to
 
04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
the bill itself the bill is about
 
04:22:14.750 --> 04:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
forming an independent redistricting
 
04:22:17.149 --> 04:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
commission um I certainly would love to
 
04:22:19.870 --> 04:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
re to relitigate redistricting um so I'm
 
04:22:21.469 --> 04:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
not going to indulge myself in that I'm
 
04:22:22.950 --> 04:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
going to ask the committee also does not
 
04:22:24.550 --> 04:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
indulge in that we are focused on the
 
04:22:26.910 --> 04:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
bill at hand representative
 
04:22:30.389 --> 04:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
quae thank you Mr chairman having read
 
04:22:32.510 --> 04:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
the bill it appears to me that it
 
04:22:35.550 --> 04:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
attempts to make the redist
 
04:22:38.429 --> 04:22:38.439 align:start position:0%
redistricting process independent of the
 
04:22:38.439 --> 04:22:39.790 align:start position:0%
redistricting process independent of the
political

04:22:39.790 --> 04:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
political
 
04:22:42.910 --> 04:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
process and if that's the
 
04:22:47.229 --> 04:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
case how does this independent
 
04:22:50.269 --> 04:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
commission how is it accountable to the
 
04:22:52.830 --> 04:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
voters so that it there's a better
 
04:22:54.990 --> 04:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
chance that it will reflect the will of
 
04:22:55.000 --> 04:22:55.950 align:start position:0%
chance that it will reflect the will of
the

04:22:55.950 --> 04:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:01.750 --> 04:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:04.109 --> 04:23:04.119 align:start position:0%
the I'm not sure I didn't write this
 
04:23:07.109 --> 04:23:07.119 align:start position:0%
bill I don't know um I
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
my idea is that when the I don't know
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
the exact process of how these people
 
04:23:15.710 --> 04:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
who would be appointed to the commission
 
04:23:18.269 --> 04:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
would be there but I would I I would
 
04:23:20.870 --> 04:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
think that you know if you wanted to
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
include the legislature at all it would
 
04:23:25.070 --> 04:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
be in appointing those people to those
 
04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
so you it's a you know almost like a
 
04:23:30.349 --> 04:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
representative democracy like we have
 
04:23:33.950 --> 04:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
the we vote on the um you know the
 
04:23:36.670 --> 04:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
legislators who then can appoint people
 
04:23:39.990 --> 04:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
to the commission that's my idea of how
 
04:23:42.550 --> 04:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh a independent commissioner would work
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore they would be
 
04:23:46.590 --> 04:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
accountable further questions from the
 
04:23:48.389 --> 04:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you Mr
 
04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
Andrew it is good to see you even though
 
04:23:53.389 --> 04:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
we disagree a lot it is good to see
 
04:23:59.590 --> 04:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:02.109 --> 04:24:02.119 align:start position:0%
democracy you have some testimony right
 
04:24:03.269 --> 04:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
I do have written testimony you want to
 
04:24:05.469 --> 04:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
go ahead and distribute it now sure so
 
04:24:07.349 --> 04:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's not making the ways while you're
 
04:24:08.910 --> 04:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
speaking and people are looking down and
 
04:24:13.510 --> 04:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
looking up and trying to do multiple
 
04:24:17.309 --> 04:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:21.189 --> 04:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
paper um for the uh good afternoon um my
 
04:24:22.750 --> 04:24:22.760 align:start position:0%

redistricting commission um I just want
 
04:24:38.469 --> 04:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
to give some math from the last election
 
04:24:39.309 --> 04:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
um in
 
04:24:43.590 --> 04:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
2022 50% of Voters cast ballots for
 
04:24:46.990 --> 04:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
Democratic senators but they only got 10
 
04:24:50.229 --> 04:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
out of 14 Democratic senators
 
04:24:54.349 --> 04:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
50.1 12% of Voters cast ballots for a
 
04:24:56.429 --> 04:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
democratic executive counselors but
 
04:24:59.309 --> 04:24:59.319 align:start position:0%
there was only one out of four um
 
04:25:03.149 --> 04:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
executive counselor uh existed and 50%
 
04:25:06.269 --> 04:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
of the State House was cast for
 
04:25:08.269 --> 04:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
Democrats um and there's only a three
 
04:25:10.389 --> 04:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
seat margin so at least for house
 
04:25:12.389 --> 04:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
members there's much more evenness than
 
04:25:14.309 --> 04:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
there are for the Senate and executive
 
04:25:17.030 --> 04:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
Council Maps um and I would say this if
 
04:25:19.830 --> 04:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
the Republican party got more votes and
 
04:25:22.469 --> 04:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
got less seats it's important that we
 
04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
understand that uh voters should be
 
04:25:26.870 --> 04:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
picking their
 
04:25:29.469 --> 04:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
politicians that politicians should not
 
04:25:31.790 --> 04:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
be picking voters in drawing the map
 
04:25:33.389 --> 04:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
this is why this independent
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission is is a good
 
04:25:38.429 --> 04:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
idea um this committee has in the past
 
04:25:41.070 --> 04:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
made bipartisan recommendations um that
 
04:25:43.389 --> 04:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
have gone on a couple of times I hope
 
04:25:45.469 --> 04:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
that your committee can can work
 
04:25:47.550 --> 04:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
together on the legislation um in order
 
04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
to do this I do want to say that this is
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
constitutional um as it is advisory and
 
04:25:56.790 --> 04:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
still allows for the legislation um to
 
04:26:01.149 --> 04:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
the vote um to be held um by the
 
04:26:03.109 --> 04:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
legislative body um and to
 
04:26:05.349 --> 04:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
representative qua qu's question I think
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
redistrict and drawing Maps is a
 
04:26:10.229 --> 04:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
political conversation in many times and
 
04:26:12.830 --> 04:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
I think what it shouldn't be about is po
 
04:26:15.630 --> 04:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
is power and who which political party
 
04:26:17.670 --> 04:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
can get the most Advantage should be
 
04:26:19.950 --> 04:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
about voters and instill instilling
 
04:26:22.870 --> 04:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
trust and confidence in the process um
 
04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
also Linda Bundy is unable to be here
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
from antrum and has written testimony
 
04:26:30.229 --> 04:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
and Bob Perry um is unable to be here
 
04:26:31.830 --> 04:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
and has written testimony and I have
 
04:26:33.710 --> 04:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
submitted both of those as
 
04:26:35.750 --> 04:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
well okay questions from will you be
 
04:26:37.070 --> 04:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
taking questions you I know you normally
 
04:26:39.429 --> 04:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
do miss sink um are there questions from
 
04:26:41.269 --> 04:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
04:26:43.550 --> 04:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
Bo thank you Mr chairman thank taking
 
04:26:45.630 --> 04:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
the question you're given the numbers
 
04:26:48.429 --> 04:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
here of percentages but the problem with
 
04:26:51.309 --> 04:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
those percentages is for example in
 
04:26:53.550 --> 04:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
house districts very you aware they have
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
to be kept in the
 
04:26:58.269 --> 04:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
county they cannot cross the county
 
04:27:01.309 --> 04:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
lines so that could don't you think that
 
04:27:04.229 --> 04:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
could be a problem with total
 
04:27:06.630 --> 04:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
numbers I I think that if you wanted to
 
04:27:08.950 --> 04:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
change the way on how County delegations
 
04:27:12.349 --> 04:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
are selected and and make district lines
 
04:27:15.910 --> 04:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
that don't cross you know or have a few
 
04:27:18.750 --> 04:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
um you that is the the rules the the you
 
04:27:20.670 --> 04:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
can set rules that allow that and I
 
04:27:23.070 --> 04:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
think that you should in the next seven
 
04:27:24.750 --> 04:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
years think about what are the the
 
04:27:27.790 --> 04:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
criteria that goes into dry lines and if
 
04:27:29.309 --> 04:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
you want to change that rule that might
 
04:27:32.389 --> 04:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
be one to consider only someone had
 
04:27:33.990 --> 04:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
submitted a bill to get rid of County
 
04:27:36.550 --> 04:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
delegation yeah that was me
 
04:27:39.510 --> 04:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah but the problem with that
 
04:27:41.149 --> 04:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
is state
 
04:27:43.710 --> 04:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
representatives you know are also the
 
04:27:46.750 --> 04:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
county representative so they have to be
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the county right but I think like
 
04:27:50.790 --> 04:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
belnap County for example could have had
 
04:27:53.790 --> 04:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
19 18 and a half state representatives
 
04:27:55.469 --> 04:27:55.479 align:start position:0%
and I think that if you were able to
 
04:27:57.309 --> 04:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
give belnap county 19 state
 
04:27:59.070 --> 04:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
representatives you could have better
 
04:28:02.269 --> 04:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
drawn that map um and maybe one person
 
04:28:04.429 --> 04:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
one state member had to be members of
 
04:28:06.030 --> 04:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
two County Commissioners cuz they
 
04:28:08.429 --> 04:28:08.439 align:start position:0%
overlapped um but you look at towns like
 
04:28:10.590 --> 04:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
Tilton and Northfield Tilton's in belnap
 
04:28:13.030 --> 04:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
county northfield's in marrat County
 
04:28:14.510 --> 04:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
they share a fire district they share a
 
04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
school district they share police fire
 
04:28:18.950 --> 04:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
so many different things and I think
 
04:28:21.950 --> 04:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
that um our you know New Hampshire's
 
04:28:24.070 --> 04:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
unique in that way and I think looking
 
04:28:25.990 --> 04:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
at what are the different pieces that go
 
04:28:28.469 --> 04:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
into drawing a maps are
 
04:28:31.389 --> 04:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
important for the questions
 
04:28:31.399 --> 04:28:32.309 align:start position:0%
important for the questions
representative

04:28:32.309 --> 04:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
Brennan thank you previously there had
 
04:28:37.910 --> 04:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
been a question about accountability and
 
04:28:41.790 --> 04:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you might opine on the
 
04:28:43.910 --> 04:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
legislature having
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
the right to approve or disapprove of
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
this advisory committee's or advisory
 
04:28:54.349 --> 04:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
commission's uh suggested Maps does that
 
04:28:57.229 --> 04:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
allow for accountability by giving the
 
04:29:00.030 --> 04:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
legislature that power the legislator
 
04:29:01.830 --> 04:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
still has the final approval of the maps
 
04:29:04.630 --> 04:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
and I think that um the voters can hold
 
04:29:07.550 --> 04:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
the legislators who who who vote up for
 
04:29:09.790 --> 04:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
the commission's recommendation or not
 
04:29:11.229 --> 04:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
for the commission's recommendation
 
04:29:14.149 --> 04:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
accountable and I think um the public
 
04:29:15.670 --> 04:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
debate I mean when we think about what
 
04:29:19.870 --> 04:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
the public debate was a decade prior um
 
04:29:21.750 --> 04:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
the maps were drawn kind of behind
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
closed doors so there was a lot more
 
04:29:25.550 --> 04:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
transparency in the process this time
 
04:29:28.389 --> 04:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
but I think New Hampshire couldn't do
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
better forur the questions seeing none
 
04:29:32.630 --> 04:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss sinks good to see you

forward we're a nonpartisan nonprofit
 
04:30:11.670 --> 04:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
organization dedicated to uh educating

empowering and uh mobilizing Young Folks
 
04:30:17.189 --> 04:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
across our state and today I'm here to
 
04:30:20.510 --> 04:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
testify in support of House Bill 1426
 
04:30:22.109 --> 04:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
which would establish an advisory
 
04:30:24.830 --> 04:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission um you know
 
04:30:27.030 --> 04:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
with the census being conducted every
 
04:30:29.389 --> 04:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
decade it's imperative that our
 
04:30:31.750 --> 04:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
legislative in Congressional Maps
 
04:30:34.429 --> 04:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
accurately reflect our population in
 
04:30:37.670 --> 04:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
demographics and as more young people uh
 
04:30:39.950 --> 04:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
come to the granite state to live work
 
04:30:41.830 --> 04:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
raise their families it's really
 
04:30:43.750 --> 04:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
critical that we ensure our
 
04:30:45.469 --> 04:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
representation is both fair and
 
04:30:47.469 --> 04:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
Equitable and you know at the end of the
 
04:30:49.109 --> 04:30:49.119 align:start position:0%
day that's what the redistricting
 
04:30:53.149 --> 04:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
process is all about um during the 2021
 
04:30:55.630 --> 04:30:55.640 align:start position:0%
redistricting process 603 forward
 
04:30:57.870 --> 04:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
mobilized hundreds of young gr Staters
 
04:31:00.349 --> 04:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
to take action for fair maps in a
 
04:31:02.429 --> 04:31:02.439 align:start position:0%
transparent process and they did so
 
04:31:04.070 --> 04:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
because they believe voters should pick
 
04:31:06.389 --> 04:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
their politicians not the other way
 
04:31:09.229 --> 04:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
around um and unfortunately while the
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
house redistricting committee held
 
04:31:12.710 --> 04:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
hearings in each County uh the map
 
04:31:14.870 --> 04:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
drawing was still done secretly uh
 
04:31:16.269 --> 04:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
behind closed doors and out of the
 
04:31:19.870 --> 04:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
public eye um this advisory independent
 
04:31:22.349 --> 04:31:22.359 align:start position:0%
registering commission created by the
 
04:31:25.670 --> 04:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
bipartisan House Bill 1426 Implement
 
04:31:27.750 --> 04:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
some key safeguards against partisan
 
04:31:30.070 --> 04:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering by being transparent
 
04:31:32.550 --> 04:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
requiring public input and not allowing
 
04:31:35.630 --> 04:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
maps to favor one party over another um
 
04:31:38.510 --> 04:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
um it's been said that house bill 1426
 
04:31:40.510 --> 04:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
is a constitutional uniquely New
 
04:31:43.309 --> 04:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire solution to creating Fair Maps
 
04:31:45.149 --> 04:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
uh because voters should dictate our
 
04:31:47.590 --> 04:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
future maps and it's important to note
 
04:31:50.429 --> 04:31:50.439 align:start position:0%
that um this commission is advisory and
 
04:31:52.630 --> 04:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
does not force A legislature to adopt a
 
04:31:54.750 --> 04:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
map that it's produced simply provides
 
04:31:56.670 --> 04:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the people of New
 
04:31:58.590 --> 04:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the opportunity to see and
 
04:32:01.870 --> 04:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
support what a fair map option would be
 
04:32:03.469 --> 04:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
um and then just in closing without
 
04:32:05.550 --> 04:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place voters who end up
 
04:32:07.710 --> 04:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
and jander districts would continue to
 
04:32:09.750 --> 04:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
find themselves disenfranchised for a
 
04:32:12.109 --> 04:32:12.119 align:start position:0%
decade and Beyond um so we ask you
 
04:32:14.189 --> 04:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
please vote uh in support of house B
 
04:32:17.389 --> 04:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
1426 and be part of a solution to ensure
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
that we have a system designed to make
 
04:32:21.109 --> 04:32:21.119 align:start position:0%
sure Granite State voices are heard in
 
04:32:22.910 --> 04:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
the red dis searching process so thank
 
04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
you for your time
 
04:32:27.670 --> 04:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
consideration um hi I'm Liz Wester I'm
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
one of the co-founders of 603 forward um
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
and just to add a few points to what
 
04:32:35.950 --> 04:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
Matt said um this bill um would limit
 
04:32:38.189 --> 04:32:38.199 align:start position:0%
who can serve on the commission um so
 
04:32:41.349 --> 04:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
there's been previous legislation filed
 
04:32:44.349 --> 04:32:44.359 align:start position:0%
um that did not Place limits on who
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
could serve on the commission so um this
 
04:32:48.630 --> 04:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
bill would make sure that anyone who was
 
04:32:50.870 --> 04:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
affiliated with or worked for a
 
04:32:53.349 --> 04:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
candidate or a political party would not
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
be able to serve so really this
 
04:32:56.830 --> 04:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
commission would be made up of New
 
04:32:58.670 --> 04:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire voters who are representing
 
04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
their communities not another interest
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
um those Commissioners would also be
 
04:33:05.510 --> 04:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
picked by a nonpartisan body made up of
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
retired judges um it would take a lot of
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
public and Community input which is
 
04:33:12.189 --> 04:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
really really important in crafting maps
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
that would be fair for the state um and
 
04:33:17.869 --> 04:33:17.879 align:start position:0%
puts in some strong um wording around
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that the maps would not
 
04:33:22.750 --> 04:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
favor one party over another at the end
 
04:33:24.429 --> 04:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
of the day creating an advisory
 
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
commission is about restoring trust in
 
04:33:28.269 --> 04:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
our elections um which I believe
 
04:33:30.230 --> 04:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
everyone in this room wants our voters
 
04:33:33.789 --> 04:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
to have um and would set up a path for a
 
04:33:37.310 --> 04:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
fair redistricting process in New
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all right you taking questions
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
sure excellent representative bone hey
 
04:33:44.789 --> 04:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman than taking the question
 
04:33:47.629 --> 04:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
since this is just advisory like I said
 
04:33:47.639 --> 04:33:49.269 align:start position:0%
since this is just advisory like I said
and

04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:51.949 --> 04:33:51.959 align:start position:0%
the legislature can just completely
 
04:33:54.990 --> 04:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
ignore it then don't you think that
 
04:33:57.869 --> 04:33:57.879 align:start position:0%
would give the governor more reason to
 
04:34:00.429 --> 04:34:00.439 align:start position:0%
veto it and then again have the
 
04:34:03.910 --> 04:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
Judiciary pick the district I would hope
 
04:34:05.830 --> 04:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
that very much like needing to have
 
04:34:07.629 --> 04:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
seven members of the commission pass a
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
map that it would um encourage
 
04:34:12.230 --> 04:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
compromise within the branches of
 
04:34:13.789 --> 04:34:13.799 align:start position:0%
government that need to vote on these
 
04:34:16.070 --> 04:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
Maps um to make sure that the maps are
 
04:34:19.070 --> 04:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
as Fair as possible um it
 
04:34:22.029 --> 04:34:22.039 align:start position:0%
is redistricting is hard and there is no
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
perfect process um but believe this is a
 
04:34:26.629 --> 04:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
step in the right
 
04:34:29.390 --> 04:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
direction further questions
 
04:34:31.750 --> 04:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you thank
 
04:34:34.310 --> 04:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I'm
 
04:34:35.949 --> 04:34:35.959 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill and and I'm
 
04:34:38.390 --> 04:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
realizing that this commission would be
 
04:34:42.670 --> 04:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
required to act in public meetings which
 
04:34:44.269 --> 04:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
says to me that there would be more
 
04:34:46.869 --> 04:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
transparency in this process I'm
 
04:34:46.879 --> 04:34:48.470 align:start position:0%
transparency in this process I'm
wondering

04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
04:34:51.230 --> 04:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
if the meetings that this commission
 
04:34:52.629 --> 04:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
would have in
 
04:34:56.670 --> 04:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
public um might that
 
04:35:00.510 --> 04:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
generate significant public support for
 
04:35:03.709 --> 04:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
the outcome of the commission's maps
 
04:35:05.869 --> 04:35:05.879 align:start position:0%
that they suggest to the
 
04:35:07.990 --> 04:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
legislature and then wouldn't the
 
04:35:10.230 --> 04:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
legislature then feel that public
 
04:35:13.310 --> 04:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
pressure to adopt the independent
 
04:35:16.429 --> 04:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission's Maps thus
 
04:35:19.470 --> 04:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
again providing for
 
04:35:22.551 --> 04:35:22.561 align:start position:0%
accountability in this process I think
 
04:35:25.109 --> 04:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
so yeah more people participating in the
 
04:35:27.029 --> 04:35:27.039 align:start position:0%
process for democracy the better thank
 
04:35:29.670 --> 04:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
you further questions seeing none thank
 
04:35:31.150 --> 04:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
you guys so much thanks for indulging me
 
04:35:33.949 --> 04:35:33.959 align:start position:0%
doing the uh the TW for there thank
 
04:35:36.750 --> 04:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
you um next up Miss tantarelli Miss
 
04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:52.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:56.150 --> 04:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
sir my name is Liz tinelli I'm a voter
 
04:36:00.310 --> 04:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
in Newbury Undeclared by party and I'm
 
04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
president of the League of Women Voters
 
04:36:03.269 --> 04:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
of New
 
04:36:06.109 --> 04:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we strongly support this
 
04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
measure as one step forward I've been
 
04:36:12.029 --> 04:36:12.039 align:start position:0%
cleaning out papers at my house before I
 
04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
moved to the old age home I figure I
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
better get a head start on it this going
 
04:36:19.109 --> 04:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
to take a while uh and I've discovered
 
04:36:22.709 --> 04:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
testimony that I wrote and delivered in
 
04:36:25.230 --> 04:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
favor of independent redistricting
 
04:36:27.551 --> 04:36:27.561 align:start position:0%
commissions dating back to
 
04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
2011 so I've been at this a while um the
 
04:36:35.349 --> 04:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
state League adopted a position in 20
 
04:36:40.109 --> 04:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
2004 I think so let me talk about why we
 
04:36:43.789 --> 04:36:43.799 align:start position:0%
want to support this we know that it is
 
04:36:46.709 --> 04:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
not constitutional for an independent
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
commission to actually make the maps and
 
04:36:53.470 --> 04:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
have them enforced as conditions stand
 
04:36:56.789 --> 04:36:56.799 align:start position:0%
now but an advisory commission certainly
 
04:36:59.150 --> 04:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
increases the transparency as
 
04:37:02.109 --> 04:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan mentioned and the
 
04:37:02.119 --> 04:37:03.269 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan mentioned and the
citizen

04:37:03.269 --> 04:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
04:37:05.830 --> 04:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
involvement and in
 
04:37:09.510 --> 04:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
21 we had good participation of citizens
 
04:37:12.390 --> 04:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature that held the hearings
 
04:37:15.590 --> 04:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
around the state uh held one in each
 
04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
County and got plenty of participation
 
04:37:20.510 --> 04:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
from people talking about communities of
 
04:37:22.429 --> 04:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
interest and so
 
04:37:25.230 --> 04:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
on but I wanted to talk about one
 
04:37:27.709 --> 04:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
specific moment in history here in New
 
04:37:29.789 --> 04:37:29.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that was in
 
04:37:32.709 --> 04:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
2019 and I realized some of you were not
 
04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
on this uh Committee in in
 
04:37:39.709 --> 04:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
2019 when we had a very similar Bill to
 
04:37:42.070 --> 04:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
this an advisory independent
 
04:37:45.070 --> 04:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission which passed
 
04:37:48.530 --> 04:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
the house 2018 to
 
04:37:48.540 --> 04:37:49.949 align:start position:0%
the house 2018 to
[Music]

04:37:49.949 --> 04:37:49.959 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:37:52.750 --> 04:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
123 that means there was strong
 
04:37:57.510 --> 04:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support for this independent
 
04:38:00.709 --> 04:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
commission the Senate tweaked the bill
 
04:38:04.310 --> 04:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
where it passed on a Voice vote again
 
04:38:06.390 --> 04:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
Strong by partisan
 
04:38:09.310 --> 04:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
support and until the very last minute
 
04:38:11.629 --> 04:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
we thought that the governor would sign
 
04:38:15.470 --> 04:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
it he did not he vetoed it and uh nobody
 
04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to challenge that
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
apparently in
 
04:38:23.470 --> 04:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
2019 this committee the house and the
 
04:38:25.869 --> 04:38:25.879 align:start position:0%
Senate recognize the value of an
 
04:38:28.990 --> 04:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
independent advisory commission it's a
 
04:38:32.109 --> 04:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
tool to get the best redistricting map
 
04:38:34.510 --> 04:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
possible with the involvement of
 
04:38:34.520 --> 04:38:37.269 align:start position:0%
possible with the involvement of
citizens

04:38:37.269 --> 04:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
taking the partisan uh you know what's
 
04:38:44.109 --> 04:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
in it for me and my district uh aspect
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
out of it to some
 
04:38:49.269 --> 04:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
extent uh with non- legislators
 
04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
designing these maps in a fair and
 
04:38:54.629 --> 04:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
transparent process so I hope that you
 
04:38:58.590 --> 04:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
will support hb1 1426 and I'd be glad to
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
take any questions questions from the
 
04:39:03.590 --> 04:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you it's
 
04:39:05.750 --> 04:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
good to see you again m t thank you and
 
04:39:08.750 --> 04:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
good to see you all Mr O'Brien with

good to see you all Mr O'Brien with

04:39:16.390 --> 04:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
votes thank you uh Mr chair members of
 
04:39:20.910 --> 04:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Michael O'Brien
 
04:39:22.629 --> 04:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
I uh work at pry strategies and
 
04:39:24.470 --> 04:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
representing America votes here today I
 
04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
think most of what I said was going to
 
04:39:27.910 --> 04:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
say has already been said um and so I
 
04:39:29.750 --> 04:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
just want to quickly just remind again
 
04:39:31.551 --> 04:39:31.561 align:start position:0%
the committee um that this is an
 
04:39:33.789 --> 04:39:33.799 align:start position:0%
advisory commission and so Falls uh well
 
04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
within uh the bounds the Constitution
 
04:39:37.510 --> 04:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
because the legislature does make the
 
04:39:39.948 --> 04:39:39.958 align:start position:0%
final say in these and that our
 
04:39:41.270 --> 04:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
democracy is strongest when people
 
04:39:44.590 --> 04:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
believe in um believe in it and in this
 
04:39:46.070 --> 04:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
case we know uh through polling and
 
04:39:49.150 --> 04:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
other uh other means that uh there is
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
question and I would argue justifiably
 
04:39:53.990 --> 04:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
so about folks drawing uh Maps when they
 
04:39:55.390 --> 04:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
have self-interest and this helps to
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
remove at least part of that
 
04:39:58.628 --> 04:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
self-interest it does still obviously
 
04:40:00.270 --> 04:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
lie in the hands of the legislature um
 
04:40:02.550 --> 04:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that um because they have
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
final approval but again uh creating a
 
04:40:06.550 --> 04:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
public process where a map is created
 
04:40:09.070 --> 04:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
brought forward and is seen uh hopefully
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
would provide enough pressure with you
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
know the kind of agreement that this Law
 
04:40:15.550 --> 04:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
requires um that these Maps would
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
continue moving forward and would become
 
04:40:20.230 --> 04:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
law as opposed to um Maps may be
 
04:40:21.868 --> 04:40:21.878 align:start position:0%
approved by one part another and just to
 
04:40:23.430 --> 04:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
stress again we're talking this is not
 
04:40:25.390 --> 04:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
to redraw maps that are already drawn
 
04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
right this is not to look and say we
 
04:40:29.390 --> 04:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
want to do this in two years or anything
 
04:40:31.910 --> 04:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
like that but for 2031 in a year when we
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
do not know um what control looks like
 
04:40:35.990 --> 04:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
and so this provides an apple this this
 
04:40:37.550 --> 04:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
is a good time to do this because both
 
04:40:40.030 --> 04:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
parties um don't have an idea of what
 
04:40:42.708 --> 04:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
2031 will look like um and so there is
 
04:40:45.310 --> 04:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
no Advantage uh given at this point uh
 
04:40:46.750 --> 04:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions uh that
 
04:40:48.830 --> 04:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
you all may have um that's all I got
 
04:40:51.470 --> 04:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
04:40:54.510 --> 04:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you last up um Mr Clemen
 
04:40:57.830 --> 04:40:57.840 align:start position:0%

04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
no um for the record my name is Henry
 
04:41:10.788 --> 04:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
Clem toich uh on behalf of the ACLU of
 
04:41:13.150 --> 04:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I submitted online
 
04:41:15.550 --> 04:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
testimony which I hope I haven't really
 
04:41:18.030 --> 04:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
used before I hope you all got um and I
 
04:41:19.470 --> 04:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat what others have
 
04:41:22.430 --> 04:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
said so just say please add ACLU of New
 
04:41:24.350 --> 04:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to the list of many
 
04:41:26.110 --> 04:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
organizations and people who've come out
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of this bill and
 
04:41:29.430 --> 04:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
who do support an independent
 
04:41:29.440 --> 04:41:30.868 align:start position:0%
who do support an independent
redistricting

04:41:30.868 --> 04:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
04:41:33.230 --> 04:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
commission it's always a dance to try to
 
04:41:35.990 --> 04:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
figure out what the best way to ensure
 
04:41:36.000 --> 04:41:36.910 align:start position:0%
figure out what the best way to ensure
public

04:41:36.910 --> 04:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:41:39.510 --> 04:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
accountability um to those drawing the
 
04:41:42.430 --> 04:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
maps is uh well weighing against that
 
04:41:44.150 --> 04:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
the possible self-interest that folks
 
04:41:46.948 --> 04:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
have I think that this proposal draws uh
 
04:41:49.230 --> 04:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
an excellent balance
 
04:41:51.670 --> 04:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
um in an improvement from previous
 
04:41:53.948 --> 04:41:53.958 align:start position:0%
versions it uses a panel of retired
 
04:41:56.670 --> 04:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
judges to help select the Commissioners
 
04:41:58.590 --> 04:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
to hopefully you know pull out the most
 
04:42:01.070 --> 04:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
civically minded Among Us um I think
 
04:42:03.788 --> 04:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
it's a great uh a great first step and I
 
04:42:05.150 --> 04:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
hope the committee will support it thank
 
04:42:06.750 --> 04:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
you very much and I'm happy to take
 
04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the
 
04:42:11.070 --> 04:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I imagine this is
 
04:42:14.670 --> 04:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
a uh thank you so much Henry want to
 
04:42:16.788 --> 04:42:16.798 align:start position:0%

coming in hot Lou oh Miss Spencer I I
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
didn't think we were going to get away
 
04:42:22.350 --> 04:42:22.360 align:start position:0%
with it
 
04:42:26.510 --> 04:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
today um thank you so much Miss Spencer
 
04:42:28.708 --> 04:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony Mr
 
04:42:31.230 --> 04:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
chair Louise fencer from the Kent Street
 
04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
Coalition we're an all volunteer
 
04:42:39.150 --> 04:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
Grassroots um advocacy group and um our
 
04:42:41.910 --> 04:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
the this is one of our primary
 
04:42:44.990 --> 04:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
priorities is redistricting and it goes
 
04:42:47.030 --> 04:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
to the point of accountability because
 
04:42:49.230 --> 04:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
if we have heavily gerrymandered
 
04:42:52.390 --> 04:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
districts we're not able to hold our
 
04:42:55.510 --> 04:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
electeds accountable um when people are
 
04:42:58.270 --> 04:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
in safe districts so in the interest of
 
04:43:02.070 --> 04:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
really having a robust democracy and
 
04:43:05.110 --> 04:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement it really
 
04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
depends on people feeling that they can
 
04:43:09.910 --> 04:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
give their input to their
 
04:43:14.110 --> 04:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
legisl legislators and get feedback so I
 
04:43:16.868 --> 04:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
just really wanted to stress that point
 
04:43:19.390 --> 04:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
and say that we're fully on board also
 
04:43:21.470 --> 04:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
and we have members across the across
 
04:43:24.350 --> 04:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
the state and across the
 
04:43:28.628 --> 04:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
street I live on Ken street but um yeah
 
04:43:31.310 --> 04:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
I hope that during this you know we're
 
04:43:33.230 --> 04:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
we're years away from redistricting this
 
04:43:35.990 --> 04:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
is a great time for us to come together
 
04:43:37.708 --> 04:43:37.718 align:start position:0%
and come up with something that we all
 
04:43:40.708 --> 04:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
