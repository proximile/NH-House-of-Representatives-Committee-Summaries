Safety so this is proposal 20237 to the
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
watercraft safety rules um this was one
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
that had been postponed previously due
 
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
to um a number of comments the
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
department wanted to address on the
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
final proposal
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
they did submit a conditional approval
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh late Tuesday I started to review it
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
there were still some substantive
 
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
comments on it that the agency and I are
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
still working on through discussions um
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
but at this point in time due to it
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
being postponed and there's still being
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
some issues I would recommend the
 
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
committee make a preliminary objection
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
at this point and allow the agency to
 
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
address those issues in a preliminary
 
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.069 align:start position:0%
address those issues in a preliminary
objection

00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
objection
 
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
that is there a second second okay
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%

Department of Safety um I just wanted to
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank the committee for the um patience
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
that it has had so far with this
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
proposal I know that in the last couple
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
of Cycles um you know we've essentially
 
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
asked for more time we've uh had some
 
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
challenges with the amount of comments
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
but also some unavoidable absences uh in
 
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of the Personnel that have been
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
on this uh and we do appreciate the
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
extra time um as Rebecca said if the
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
committee were to give us a preliminary
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
objection we would be continuing to um
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
work on uh our response okay any
 
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
questions comments or
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
concerns seeing none those in favor of a
 
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:55.240 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection based on staff
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
comments I I opposed
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
much right Board of
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
Nursing okay um these are licensing
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
requirement rules um the nursing 300s so
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
this proposal was postponed from the
 
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
last meeting to allow the agency to
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
address the legislative intent comments
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
and uh the unclear comments and a
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
revised amended conditional approval
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
request has been filed and you should
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
have that in front of you the first
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
comment is on page two of the
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
PDF at the last meeting we discussed at
 
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
length the um the language and the rule
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
specifically in the statute the statute
 
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
allows for three types of lure and um
 
00:12:44.189 --> 00:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
that's by
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
endorsement alternate educa alternate
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
experience and um uh forget the other
 
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
one but anyway um so right now the rule
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
still says alternate education when it
 
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
should read alternate experience and I
 
00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:01.399 align:start position:0%
spoke with Tina a couple of days ago and
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
this is a mistake and so um she plans on
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
asking as part of the conditional
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
approval request today to uh change that
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
there in that section and then also in
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
section e below and so um besides that
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
you'll also see a comment down towards
 
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
the lower left of the page that points
 
00:13:24.189 --> 00:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
out a need for legislation to address
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's still fee
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
Authority in this particular board
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
statute and that's just an FYI and um
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
again on the fee Authority um there has
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
been an updated informational note that
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
we've been placing on the board's rules
 
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see that on the last page and the
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
reason for that update is um we sat down
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
with the oplc and um we took a look at
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
HB 518 and that is um currently in
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
process and that should deal with the
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
the issue around the fees so if it
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
should pass um we shouldn't be needing
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
to make that uh com any longer the
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
agency will be doing some rule making
 
00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:04.519 align:start position:0%
and is looking at some of their rules as
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
well um the only other issue with the
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
proposal is that there are some
 
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
legislative intent comments because the
 
00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:13.759 align:start position:0%
remaining sections of the rule have been
 
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
expired since March and um I think that
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
the committee kind of talked about it a
 
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:21.079 align:start position:0%
little bit last time but um there are
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
some fees associated with it so you may
 
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
you know thought I would mention it but
 
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
anyway those are the um issues with this
 
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.230 align:start position:0%
anyway those are the um issues with this
proposal

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
Al good morning Miss Kelly good morning
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
Tina Kelly office of professional lenser
 
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.710 align:start position:0%
Tina Kelly office of professional lenser
and

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
certification um with regards to with
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
everything that Rebecca said we're going
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
to make the change from um education to
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
experience and with regards to the um
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
expired rules it's either that they're
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
smaller part of a larger section or
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
they're in statute and so they've only
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
been enforced with regards to what's in
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
statute um fees are all covered in oplc
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
and I believe that was before March that
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
opl's fees went into
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
effect no their their fee rule actually
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
went into effect in July so there was a
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:35.430 align:start position:0%
 
July

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
good morning executive director Lindsay
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
Courtney office of professional Li
 
00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:40.759 align:start position:0%
Insurance certification I apologize I
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't prepared to address this issue
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
today um the Board of Nursing had a
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
series of emergency rules as well so I'd
 
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
have to go back and review to see
 
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
whether those rules um included uh fees
 
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
but I but I do agree with you that our
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
May no the the that proposal was
 
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.550 align:start position:0%
May no the the that proposal was
2023

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
52 I think that was in the PLC 10002s I
 
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
think they went into effect in July or
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
August I think it was July Rebecca
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
Ricard is saying she believes it's July
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
too but um you could be right in any in
 
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
any event um director Courtney I think
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
the simplest thing would be if
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
the simplest thing would be if
you

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
went through your emergency rules and
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
the statute and identified any fees that
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
were inappropriately charged absolutely
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
well do
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%

said in the outset um the board will
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%

questions those in favor
 
00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:20.829 align:start position:0%
questions those in favor
I

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:20.839 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
much the next EX the next proposal is
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
2023 141 definitions of financial
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
assistance and medical
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
assistance this particular proposal did
 
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh have a CA filed with our office um
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
after the deadline we have had um our
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
comments goinging back to the agencies a
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
little late this time around due to some
 
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
illnesses and absences in our own office
 
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
um so we would be in favor of the the
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
committee granting them a waiver um due
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
to the late CA and in that uh
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
conditional approval they did address
 
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
two of the issues um the first is on
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
page 14 of the conditional approval they
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
did change the citation from the federal
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
regulated uh Federal Regulation
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
definition of dependent child and cited
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
the statute um however I still had u a
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
little bit of uh
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
comment on that due to them saying it
 
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
was a definition and even though the
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
statutory title of that section says
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
definitions when you read it it's not
 
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
actually a definition it's more of a
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
description of what a needy child is in
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
order to be eligible for the financial
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
aid so I just in my comment um proposed
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
some language to just change that to say
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
um dependent child means as described uh
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me um a needy child means excuse
 
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
me I'm not feeling great I apologize uh
 
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
a dependent child means a needy child as
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
described in
 
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.830 align:start position:0%
described in
RSA

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
1676 Section 5 um as opposed to what's
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
written which could be addressed in an
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
oral uh amendment to their conditional
 
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
approval if they agree and then the only
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
other comment is on page 20 of the
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
conditional approval text um where the
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
agency is not using the definition
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
statutory definition of specified
 
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
relative however in talking with the
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
agency this was an intentional Choice as
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
it seems that this state statute is
 
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
being amended to include court appointed
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
Guardians that's a change I believe will
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
take effect in early this upcoming year
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
and due to these being um Medicaid rules
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
that is not something that the Federal
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
Regulations allow um court appointed
 
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
Guardians is more for the purpose of
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
tanif assistance as opposed to Medicaid
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
so they are intentionally not adopting
 
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
the state statutory definition for that
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
reason um and those were the only two
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
approval uh good morning Nicole Valena
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
rules coordinator for
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh the rules unit for Department of
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
Services good morning David shney uh
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
Deputy Medicaid director uh with respect
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
to the definition for dependent
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
dependent child um attorney rard could
 
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
we just keep it I agree with saying as I
 
00:20:50.669 --> 00:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
can't see you but as described in can we
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
just keep it as a dependent child and
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
not add the
 
00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:57.799 align:start position:0%
needy um just to make sure I'm clear so
 
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
it's uh dependent child means a child
 
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
and then as described in I I would say
 
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
that would also be fine so we will make
 
00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.430 align:start position:0%
that would also be fine so we will make
that

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
change and then um with regards to
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
specified relative I think it's you know
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
if any members of the committee have
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
additional questions um after what
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
attorney rard I have a a question what
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
does this mean that a guardian of a
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
dependent child who is on Medicaid is
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
not themselves eligible for
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or is there some other
 
00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
something else going on that I don't
 
00:21:35.279 --> 00:21:47.510 align:start position:0%
something else going on that I don't
quite

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
understand hi good morning um my name is
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
Don Tierney of the Medicaid policy
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
administrator for the Department of
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
and that's not what it means
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
means thank you what does it mean um it
 
00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:06.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to oversimplify it
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
very complicated but it would it would
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
mean um that the non-relative legal
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
guardian if that status permits them to
 
00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
claim them on their taxes that the
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
income of the Guardian would then count
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
towards the child's eligibility where if
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
we don't include that
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
definition the guard
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
um their income will not count towards
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
the child's eligibility so if the the
 
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
potential is that the child would maybe
 
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
lose Medicaid Eligibility versus keeping
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
it or on the other
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
hand the
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
guardian may be in a parent caretaker
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
relative eligibility category which we
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
only get a 50/50 match for whereas now
 
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
they could be in their own household and
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
be eligible potentially under granted
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
advantage and we would get a higher
 
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
rate so we didn't really have a lot of
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
time also to analyze this by the time
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
the statute took effect to determine
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not it would be Bene more
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
beneficial for the child or the court
 
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.870 align:start position:0%
beneficial for the child or the court
appointed

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:34.830 align:start position:0%
 
Guardian

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
Schmid how soon are you going to know
 
00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
um probably not until after this takes
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
effect because we don't know really how
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
many people we're talking about that's
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
the other question I had yeah I don't
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
know okay
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
so you're trying to maintain the current
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
state status for court cour appointed
 
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
Guardians and not include them in the
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
general definition of yes responsible
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
adult for for child on Medicaid yes
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
until you figure out whether they ought
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
to be there or not yes and whether what
 
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:17.799 align:start position:0%
the cost could potentially be to the
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
state okay and as I recall when we
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
changed it to allow the Guardians to get
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
tanif we didn't discuss the issue of
 
00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:32.919 align:start position:0%
whether they were already eligible for
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or would be eligible for
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so there's no
 
00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:38.630 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so there's no
clear

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
um legislative intent at least as far as
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
I remember does anybody have any more
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
information okay we don't none of us
 
00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
have any better information so
 
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
um if we have any have a motion I'd like
 
00:24:57.549 --> 00:24:57.559 align:start position:0%
to have you consider this and report
 
00:24:59.789 --> 00:24:59.799 align:start position:0%
back back when you have a chance because
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
it's obviously something that was left
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
hanging when we changed the the uh the
 
00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:08.750 align:start position:0%
hanging when we changed the the uh the
guardian

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
guardian
 
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
rules representative Mor oh excuse me
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
director excuse me uh because we
 
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
have a late filed conditional approval
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
request and there's an oral adjustment
 
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
the committee would have to vote to
 
00:25:21.149 --> 00:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
accept that separate from voting on The
 
00:25:21.159 --> 00:25:22.750 align:start position:0%
accept that separate from voting on The
Proposal

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
Proposal
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
okay do we have such a
 
00:25:29.389 --> 00:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
motion so mooves
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
second okay and representative brassy

comments those in favor I opposed okay
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
so now we can consider
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
the the rule is there a motion on it
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%

second that is including the verbal
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
correction and the action to report back
 
00:25:58.799 --> 00:26:01.950 align:start position:0%
correction and the action to report back
on

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960 align:start position:0%

00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
editorial Corrections for you as well
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
with the um conditional approval request
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
was that that's correct that's all said
 
00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about the the
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
conditional approval yes okay I wasn't
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
sure if we needed to go over those
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
details first or anything
 
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
okay expired rules
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
yes um it sounds like in speaking to the
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
program area there was some staff change
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
over around the time of when this rule
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
is expiring uh it was missed as soon as
 
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
we caught it we began regular Ru making
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
time um how could
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
you deal with Hospice Services which I
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
can imagine are pretty substantial
 
00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
without having a rule in
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
place so under the New Hampshire statute
 
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
um it directed the department to file a
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
state plan amendment to cover Hospice
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
Services um up to the extent that
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
Medicare covers them so we've been um
 
00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
following the Medicare regulations with
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
respect to Hospice Services um and the
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
regulations really apply to the fee for
 
00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:58.120 align:start position:0%
service population which is only about
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
one and a half% of the Medicaid
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
population most of the um population is
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
in Managed Care um and so the Hospice
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
Services are delivered through the manag
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
care organizations which the state
 
00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:11.559 align:start position:0%
contracts with um in accordance with uh
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:22.990 align:start position:0%
 
manuals

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
manuals
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
gr so for those people who required the
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
services that were not
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
not on Medicare how was that handled so
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
the the Medicaid uh rules follow the the
 
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
Medicare rules so the
 
00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:42.919 align:start position:0%
the when operating the program um we we
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
operated it consistent with the the
 
00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:47.799 align:start position:0%
Medicare conditions for coverage and the
 
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
Medicare Federal
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
Regulations um so uh that's that's how
 
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
they were the the individual didn't need
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
to be Medicare eligible as long as they
 
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
had Medicaid and they were in Fe for
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
service uh we operated the program in
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
accordance with the the Medicare
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
regulations which is what we were
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
directed to do underneath the New
 
00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:10.269 align:start position:0%
directed to do underneath the New
Hampshire

00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
statute so so you were using the
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
existing Medicare rules for people who
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
are not eligible for
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
Medicare but they're eligible for
 
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um which is the coverage
 
00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:24.919 align:start position:0%
benefit yes thank
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
you please so for those people people
 
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
let's pretend like me who are not on
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and not
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
Medicare how are those Services
 
00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:39.519 align:start position:0%
administered uh they're administered
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
through the the Medicare program um
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
which is run through the federal
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
government if you're not on Medicare and
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
you're not on Medicaid your own
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
insurance presumably would deal with
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
hospice okay that's what I'm looking for
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
cover threee commercial plan yes the
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
market okay thank you that's helpful all
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
right any enforcement action during the
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
expiration of these rules that were P
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
penalized uh Hospice Care
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
Services was anybody penalized at all uh
 
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
absent any any if if they had if we had
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
these rules that violated the state
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
rules was there any enforcement action
 
00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:23.389 align:start position:0%
rules was there any enforcement action
at

00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
all I don't know I'd have to take it
 
00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:27.519 align:start position:0%
back uh full disclosure I started in
 
00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:29.559 align:start position:0%
August so I don't have the the full
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
benefit of history since 2018 I don't
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
know if Don knows but I can I can take
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
it back and follow
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
up you might I don't know who who would
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
be responsible for doing this but it
 
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
sounds to me we have a real mess here
 
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
with multiple sets of
 
00:30:48.679 --> 00:30:50.750 align:start position:0%
with multiple sets of
rules

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
and I find that it's going to be very
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
difficult for people to know which rule
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
applies and I how can we straighten that
 
00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
out director moral do you have an
 
00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
idea uh absent of legislative change I
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
do not know okay so it's in our court
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
you move to approve the conditional
 
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.190 align:start position:0%
you move to approve the conditional
request

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
comments those in favor I opposed
 
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
much good
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
luck all right so the next one is
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
196 uh determination of the assistant
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
payment and that one has been expired
 
00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:47.870 align:start position:0%
payment and that one has been expired
since

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
it uh good morning again uh Nicole
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
Valena administrative rules unit
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
um with respect to this rule to be
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
completely honest this is um an example
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
of when a program or an agency used to
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
be allowed to open up one single
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph and make an edit and so
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
therefore the section had sort of
 
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
multiple different expiration dates and
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
so this is an example of how part of the
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
section was missed due to part of it not
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
being expired and part of it being
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
expired so we happy that that's no
 
00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
longer an option but that's the truth of
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
how this one was
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
missed and within that section honestly
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
it's actually this rule is the bulk of
 
00:32:37.629 --> 00:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
it is just about how determining
 
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:39.799 align:start position:0%
assistance payments and the timeline so
 
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the rule is discussing sort
 
00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:44.919 align:start position:0%
of at what time a payment is made Etc
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
and it's only
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
addressing again this specific
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
population um of folks receiving
 
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.750 align:start position:0%
population um of folks receiving
assistants

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
assistants
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
who say they may be living with a
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
grandparent or something and then they
 
00:32:58.029 --> 00:32:58.039 align:start position:0%
don't have a shelter cost and so they
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
have a one-third reduction of assistance
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
so the bulk of the rule is just talking
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
about what days of the month you might
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
Etc sen just so I'm clear so again you
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
had one paragraph out of an entire rule
 
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
that expired and this now brings the
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
whole rule into we have a single single
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
rule not paragraphs out that have
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
outliers opposite we H we had one
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph that wasn't expired with the
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
other paragraphs expired but that last
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
paragraph had to be the one not expired
 
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so it move to conditionally
 
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.750 align:start position:0%
thank you so it move to conditionally
approve

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
approve
 
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
second any uh comments questions
 
00:33:47.629 --> 00:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
discussion those in favor I
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
opposed right thank you right
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
ambulances um so this one is actually an
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
interim rule um the the agency filed
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
this interim rule because the effective
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
rule expired on December 1st um of this
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
year they did file this rule prior to
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
that expiration but unlike in regular Ru
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
making the filing of an interm rule will
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
not stay that expiration date um but
 
00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
that's why part e of RSA 541
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
a191 allows agencies to file interm
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
rules to limit the amount of time a rule
 
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
is expired before regular rule making
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
can occur um the agency had originally
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
filed the rule as it was effective um
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
because this rule had not been in rle
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
making since 2013 it was a little bit um
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
outside of our current manual standards
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
um so they did file a conditional
 
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
approval to address um the lack of
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
certification that was uh needed to be
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
in the rule text and also to update what
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
one of the form names so the only
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
comment I had is that the current rule
 
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
is is now technically expired and has
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
been since the first of this
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
month good morning good morning Allison
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
radme the administrator for the
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unit of the
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
Services good morning Don Tierney
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%

for the Department of Health and Human
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
Services with respect to the um the
 
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
expert of the rule immediately upon uh
 
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
realizing this was to expire on December
 
00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
1st uh we knew we couldn't file regular
 
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
rule making uh and get the notice uh in
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
to OLS on time uh so we did immediately
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
put this into an interm Rule and we are
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
prepared to move forward uh after the
 
00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:46.839 align:start position:0%
holiday um probably the first week in
 
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
January to start this going into regular
 
00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.990 align:start position:0%

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
okay move to conditionally
 
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.790 align:start position:0%
okay move to conditionally
approve

00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
approve
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask if there were any
 
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.870 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask if there were any
enforcement

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
good uh are there is there a policy in
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
HHS to examine your rules for expired
 
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
rules because I was very uh shocked that
 
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
you had so many expired rules showing up
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
this month we're trying our best um
 
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
there's two of us in the unit and
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
there's 3,000 rules about in the
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
department um so as we have a new
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
program that we're kind of trying to
 
00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:33.079 align:start position:0%
work with uh we don't love it too much
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
but we're also on our own as uh we are
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
certifying rules uh we're actually
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
updating our own spreadsheets so we can
 
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.230 align:start position:0%
updating our own spreadsheets so we can
kind

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
kind
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
of try to let programs know um but again
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
there's two of us in about 3,000 rules
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
so okay well that's a that's an we're
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
trying our best that's why you seeing so
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
many kind of come forward because we're
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
trying to identify them okay thank you
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
you any other questions or comments just
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
a comment on our our side of the things
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
we are trying to incorporate um
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
basically a a a a warning for when the
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
rules will be expiring that that will be
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
a new thing coming when with our new
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
system as it comes up just maybe a few
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
months okay well that that will help
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
because private spreadsheets are
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
notorious for missing
 
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
things all right any uh we have a motion
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
yes okay any further comments
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none those in favor I I
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you very much
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
and good
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
luck so next item is 2023 152 The
 
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
Establishment and operation of area
 
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
agencies uh this one also had a
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request filed that
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
addressed almost all of uh the comments
 
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
that was on the final proposal the only
 
00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839 align:start position:0%
remaining comment and it seems to be
 
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
maybe just an unintentional error on
 
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
page six of the uh request conditional
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
approval request text they had changed
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
one term in which I had commented on
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
they were using the term developmental
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
disability service system which was not
 
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
a defined term the statute had defined
 
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
Service delivery system
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
and in that particular section they
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
changed the first mention of it but the
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
second me mention of it they left it as
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
the developmental disab uh disability
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
service system which could be addressed
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
if the agency made an oral amendment to
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
their conditional approval request and
 
00:38:47.309 --> 00:38:47.319 align:start position:0%
then that would address all of the

right thank you very much that's that
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
one Board of mental health practice

chairwoman Maguire did you want to take
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
up the item that was moved from consent
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
it's also an HHS
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
proposal uh yes well we've got them up
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
there that would help that's item K
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
which is number
 
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
243 the impaired driver programs
 
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
representative Leon took this off
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh to um this was on the impaired driver
 
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
um programs and I think we um we did
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
some back and forth with the agency and
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh they filed a conditional approval
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
request and I think I only had a couple
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
of editorial comments left on it which
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
they could handle you know uh in a
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
response but um I wasn't sure if there
 
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
was anything else that um that we needed
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
to address I don't think I had any
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
informational notes on this one either
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative Leon if you would
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
express your concern um thank you um as
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
I was reading through um I know that
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
these programs have been operating
 
00:41:20.829 --> 00:41:20.839 align:start position:0%
through video conferencing so that's a
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
virtual face Toof face but not an
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
in-person face Toof face I just wanted
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the rules assuming
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
that that's something that was an
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
intention for the Department to continue
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
that the rules specify that face Toof
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
face includes a virtual face Toof face
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
and not just inperson face to
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%

Foundation
 
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
um I would specifically I've had to
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
write this down and I'll keep it brief
 
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to specifically address the fee
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
increases pursuant to ha50
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
501 when RSA 265a was signed into law
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
effective January 1st 2013 the statute
 
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
significantly revised delivery of
 
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
services an unintentional consequence of
 
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
the law has been a reduction in idcmp
 
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
revenues that has led directly to the
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
closures of several idcm programs
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
throughout the state I counted six this
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
morning just off the top of my head
 
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
amethyst Foundation has been
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
Incorporated for 41 years and is such we
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
are well acquainted with the business
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
Acumen needed to run a successful
 
00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
nonprofit since
 
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
2013 amethyst has managed to stay
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
solvent by the following measures we've
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
tightened up expenditure across the
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
board we are not doing Capital
 
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
Improvements we're temporarly closing
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
offices and we're not filling positions
 
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
as they become vacant after several
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
years of Warning by our Auditors it has
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
become apparent amethyst can no longer
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
continue to serve the population in need
 
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
of DWI programs with without the
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
proposed fee increases you may or may
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
not be aware that's the only source of
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
revenue for the ID cmps its fee per
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
service um many of the um as some of you
 
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
may know the idcmp is meant monthly over
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
the course of six months to assess the
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
rule changes and specifically in this
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
case to look at fee increases we were
 
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
very very careful we wanted to represent
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
um the cost of living adjustments and we
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
were really careful balancing the needs
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
of the clients with the abil ability of
 
00:44:59.309 --> 00:44:59.319 align:start position:0%
the idcm PS to continue to offer idcm
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
DWI services so I'm just urging you to
 
00:45:04.589 --> 00:45:04.599 align:start position:0%
accept and confirm the proposed fee
 
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
increases you do not want to see DWI
 
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
programs not be able to operate because
 
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
of the reduction in fees that the RSA
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately allowed all right thank
 
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:19.240 align:start position:0%

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
defined in this fee schedule you feel
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
need to be increased in order to allow
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
the program remain viable rules the
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
rules show the increases that we felt
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
were fair to clients programs the rules
 
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
that were adop that we already adopted
 
00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
you're okay with yes thank you okay
 
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you I have a

have that in our uh it was not submitted
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
to the office uh prior to this meeting
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
um if you wanted to forward it to our
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
office we could disseminate it to the
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%

thank
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
you it will be part of the transcript
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
too thank
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
you good morning Allison radme
 
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
administrator for the administrative
 
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
rules unit of the Department of Health
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
and Human Services M that's a mouthful
 
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
when you're saying it like five
 
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
times so I did want to clarify uh haa
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
50501 where H which houses the schedule
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
of fees that was not expired um that was
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
not expired the emergency rule that we
 
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
put forward was um only dealing with the
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
the credit card transaction fees that
 
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
are provided um or charged by Banks
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
allowing uh the programs I believe to to
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
collect those fees from their clients um
 
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
so they wouldn't be losing money um we
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
originally were we were trying real hard
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
to get this rule through um but we
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to prevent expiration so we did a
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
lot of stakeholder uh work on the back
 
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
end which kind of required us to push it
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
off um coming to Jael car but it was
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
very minor uh a very minor rule change
 
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
that was expired it was not the entire
 
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.430 align:start position:0%
that was expired it was not the entire
free

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
free
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
schedule thank you that's and and the
 
00:47:57.069 --> 00:47:57.079 align:start position:0%
rule that specifically expired again is
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
if they had a $100 fee and it was a $5
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
credit card charge they could charge
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
$105 rather than the flat $100 they
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
would be able to recover the the banking
 
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
cost basically exactly we didn't want
 
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
them to be out because essentially they
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
were losing Revenue because they were
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
paying that cost of those fees yeah and
 
00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
the existing rules other than that one
 
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
piece were not expired we not expired
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
not expired and even if they were they
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
would have continued because you were in
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
Ru making at the time correct correct
 
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.470 align:start position:0%
Ru making at the time correct correct
yeah

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the emergency Rule and
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
that's correct it was just for that one
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
piece so it had a paragraph that just um
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
had the transaction fee um for every
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
payment made um uh the transaction fee
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
so that was all that was was put into
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
place with the emergency Rule and so
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
when the emergency rule expired the rule
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
just um went back into effect as it was
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much I'm
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
relieved thank you all right any other
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
much the board of mental health
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
practice yeah um so there are uh just
 
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
three issues that are keeping uh this
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
item from being on consent there has
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
been a conditional approval request
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
filed um but first is uh that there are
 
00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:23.079 align:start position:0%
a couple of places in the rule that the
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
board um that the rule says board rather
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
than oplc and so Tina planned on um
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
orally requesting for that change and
 
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's an a couple places on pages three
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
and seven of the conditional approval
 
00:49:41.069 --> 00:49:41.079 align:start position:0%
packet um the second reason is there was
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
some difference between the fees on the
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
board's website and what's in the PLC
 
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
rule but Tina and I walk through those
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
um each one of those uh fees and uh
 
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
that's due to the program Health facil
 
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
that program fee rather and so um
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
there's no issue there um lastly there's
 
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
been some testimony submitted from the
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
community Behavioral Health
 
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
Association and um that is linked on the
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
website as well as an email um exchange
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
from Tina um talking about uh that
 
00:50:16.109 --> 00:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
testimony so the the testimony says that
 
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
it's not possible to complete the
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
required supervisory experience within 4
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
years and uh that amount of time that
 
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
has to be um done is is 100 hours um the
 
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
board says that the requirement has to
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
be met within four not not 2 years and
 
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh the rules don't cap the number of
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
hours per week that a supervisory
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
experience um you know that number that
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
amount that they can do for each week I
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
took a look at the rule and and I think
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct it doesn't talk about a
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
maximum amount it talks about a minimum
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
which is um roughly about an hour a week
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
and um so I don't think that the rules
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
been read correctly around that piece of
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
it um so you know that's roughly like I
 
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
said about 1 hour a week so about 54
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
hours a year so they could meet2 hours a
 
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
year right sorry 5 hours a year right so
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
is is that one hour a week a minimum or
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
a maximum that is a minimum so they
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
could do more and they it's doable
 
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
within two years but they do have four 4
 
00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
years they can renew it and have up to
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
four years um there was a comment that
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
um there wasn't a limit on it before
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's only so that somebody doesn't go
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
forever so four years is completely
 
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
doable and the other part of this is
 
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
that the certification is not required
 
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
from what I understand and it is simply
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement purposes uh let's
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
let's see is everyone happy with the
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
supervisory being four no more than four
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
that okay so is that what the rule
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
states yeah that's the way I read the
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
rule okay so we'll try and make it more
 
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
obvious if there's confusion but you
 
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
right four years seems like more than
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
enough time to get to suffer through
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
certification um thank you madam chair
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Lindsay
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
Courtney executive director oplc so this
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
certification came back um came about I
 
00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
believe in the 2019 legislative session
 
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
um historically the way Mental Health
 
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
Providers have obtained their license is
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
they graduate they have to get a period
 
00:52:57.789 --> 00:52:57.799 align:start position:0%
of supervised
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
experience um they had to submit a an
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
agreement to the board it was a
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
candidate agreement that was approved by
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
the board but it wasn't a license and
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
they were able to essentially practice
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
under supervision and then at some point
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
they apply for a license but during that
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
period of time they're not able to be
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
eligible for reimbursement because
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
they're not actually licensed so during
 
00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
I believe it was 2019 or
 
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
2020 um the
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
statute was changed to allow for
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
lure um but the portion of the statute
 
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
regarding candidates has not yet been
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
repealed the way I interpret that is
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
that it's essentially an optional
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
pathway for those who want a license um
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
while they obtain their
 
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
supervision and the license allows them
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
to do what be reimbursed for services
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
it's a reimbursement issue as opposed to
 
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
issue again if I please so again this is
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
an insurance issue really right so the
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
ability for without a license they
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
cannot get reimbursed from an insurance
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
carrier but with a license they can get
 
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursed from an insurance carrier for
 
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:15.640 align:start position:0%
services provided right but the statute
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
didn't eliminate the option to to do it
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
without the
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
license okay so they are working under
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
supervision but this allows them to be
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
paid for the work they're doing under
 
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
supervision correct okay that doesn't
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
appear to be the understanding of the
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
people that wrote us that letter and
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
testimony so we'll try and obviously
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
communication chair
 
00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
yes can you explain then the
 
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
um the reason for this misunderstanding
 
00:54:56.589 --> 00:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
because this was not addressed by the
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
board during the
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
hearings so correct this issue didn't
 
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:03.640 align:start position:0%
come up before the board the issue that
 
00:55:05.549 --> 00:55:05.559 align:start position:0%
came up before the board was the two
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
years and the minimum 100 I guess the
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
point that I was trying to make is that
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
if the concern is that you can't
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
complete within four years 100 hours it
 
00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that you would never
 
00:55:22.829 --> 00:55:22.839 align:start position:0%
qualify to get your license um as a
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
clinical mental health counselor it just
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
means that you would do it and not be
 
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
eligible for reimbursement because the
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority for the candidate
 
00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
agreement process is still in statute I
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
will say there's a proposed piece of
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that would repeal that um
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
but for right now there there Remains
 
00:55:42.599 --> 00:55:44.390 align:start position:0%
but for right now there there Remains
Two

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
Two
 
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
Pathways so we really so far excuse me
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
follow up please follow
 
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
up we're really only addressing right
 
00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
now the first first letter because we
 
00:55:58.750 --> 00:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
have two two areas of concern from the
 
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
right and and it when I read the letter
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's implied that the certification
 
00:56:09.069 --> 00:56:09.079 align:start position:0%
was not for counseling it was for other
 
00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:11.799 align:start position:0%
duties so
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
that's it sounds like there's a major
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
miscommunication followup follow please
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
but these this this letter was presented
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
to the board before the hearing so they
 
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:25.799 align:start position:0%
knew about it and they didn't address it
 
00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
then or they didn't so I just don't know
 
00:56:30.589 --> 00:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
why that would happen I do think and I'm
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
not going to speak for the board because
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
uh I represent an entirely different
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
entity but I do believe that they did
 
00:56:39.549 --> 00:56:39.559 align:start position:0%
address it it's set forth in the final
 
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
proposal um the issue regarding whether
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
100 hours is or I'm sorry one hour per
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
week is a maximum versus a minimum as
 
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
well as the renewal time frame that was
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
addressed the board just believed that 4
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
hours um was a sufficient period of time
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
time in order to complete your
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
supervision okay but what about their
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
concern about the duties allowable with
 
00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:04.309 align:start position:0%
concern about the duties allowable with
that

00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
certification is that
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
confused I'm not sure about that I
 
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
didn't about
 
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
this I will say that the board addressed
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
everything that was in the letter
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
and they did go through it step by
 
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
step on that particular issue I can't I
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
was so I can't I can't address that at
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
this time all
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
right yeah I can't speak to the co scope
 
00:57:47.029 --> 00:57:47.039 align:start position:0%
of practice issue we did um send the
 
00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
letter to the board yesterday um and
 
00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:52.039 align:start position:0%
requested that somebody be able to
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
attend they weren't able to attend um
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
and I can't speak to the scope of
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
practice issue that's entirely under the
 
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
purview of the board okay but your
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this certificate
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
is for someone who is working under
 
00:58:08.829 --> 00:58:08.839 align:start position:0%
supervision and the supervision
 
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
agreement has been approved by the board
 
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you any other comments
 
00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.390 align:start position:0%
so thank you any other comments
questions

00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
IES excuse me there's so many to me it's
 
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
still not
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
clear um I'm just wondering if we can
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
postpone this for the next meeting do we
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
have time to do that we do our deadline
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
meeting director M but we do have a
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
motion uh to approve pardon
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:58.230 align:start position:0%
motion uh to approve pardon
sorry

00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
what's that if there's consensus to push
 
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
reconsider I think that would be
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate yes
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
second okay we have a motion to
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
reconsider our
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
vote those in favor I I opposed
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
I okay um and then there is a motion to
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
postpone the final approval until our
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
January meeting with the hope that the
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
board will be able to address some of
 
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
these issues by then with that uh is
 
00:59:39.069 --> 00:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
that the int the the intent no okay so
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
we have a motion to
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
opposed all right we will see you in
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
January with a report from the board and
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully all our other issues have been
 
00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.349 align:start position:0%
hopefully all our other issues have been
resolved

00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
okay anything else director
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
moral we have two items under other
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
business the first is an uh emergency
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
rule from oplc it was filed a week
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
ago um this summer I think it was in
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
July oplc adopted uh PLC
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
1002 a lengthy proposal I believe uh due
 
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
to a number of statutory changes
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
um as part of it um the licensure period
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh or the period for certificate of
 
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
Authority for Architects and
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers changed from 12
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
months to 24 months at the same time the
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
fee doubled uh which appeared logical
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
and no comment was made either from us
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
or the public uh it turns out in
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
retrospect that that was not the intent
 
01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.950 align:start position:0%
retrospect that that was not the intent
of

01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:59.470 --> 01:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
oplc uh that they intended to keep the
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
fee the same and they are concerned
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
about uh there will be costs to the
 
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
engineers and The
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
Architects um I mean there does seem to
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
be an emergency it's in essence created
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.710 align:start position:0%
by the
agency

01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:17.720 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
uh through oversight apparently um and
 
01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:23.319 align:start position:0%
there was a discussion of the number of
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
people uh close to 1900 between the two
 
01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:27.950 align:start position:0%
people uh close to 1900 between the two
uh

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
boards um and they're talking about uh
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
close to
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
$350,000 but I'm not sure of this of
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
that sum because that would I assume be
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
for the 24mon period I mean if they
 
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
start rule making immediately within
 
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
three or four months they could have the
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
regular rule finished and uh so I don't
 
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
know what the actual amount would be uh
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know when
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
whether these people uh lienes are all
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
licensed at the same time whether it's
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
staggered by birth month or what but
 
01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
answer thank you Lindy Courtney oplc
 
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
executive director so um attorney moral
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
is absolutely correct in this past
 
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
summer we had attempted to take all of
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
the boards existing fees and put them
 
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
into one proposal which uh was approved
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
in PLC 10002s there were a couple of
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
changes in statute to the statutory term
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
some went from three years to two years
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
and some went from one year to two years
 
01:02:40.269 --> 01:02:40.279 align:start position:0%
so the intent was to take the existing
 
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
fee and double it to account for the
 
01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
two-year time frame what we actually did
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to the coas was
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
quadruple the fee um and so instead of
 
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
it being um so originally one of the
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
fees was
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
$77.50 for one year instead of it being
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
$155 we um set the fee at
 
01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
$310 I think that was just due to
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
drafting errors in multiple revisions
 
01:03:15.309 --> 01:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
and not understanding if we had already
 
01:03:17.789 --> 01:03:17.799 align:start position:0%
made the calculation or not we did not
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
receive any comments from the boards we
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
did not receive any comments from the
 
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
public until about two weeks ago we
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
received a comment and then we reviewed
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
the matter and realized that that was
 
01:03:32.029 --> 01:03:32.039 align:start position:0%
not the intent and and and I I think
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
it's the right uh thing to do um so we
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
filed the emergency rules and we're
 
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
working on refunding the people who have
 
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
already paid for
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
renewals so the uh engineering and
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
architecture licenses go out over the
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
course of the Year yes
 
01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
correct all right any other discussion
 
01:03:59.069 --> 01:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
on this this issue this rule all right
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
well thank you for catching up and thank
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
you for doing the right thing thank you
 
01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
right all
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
right the remaining item is uh the
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
schedule of Del car meetings for next
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
year I think you each have a copy uh the
 
01:04:18.029 --> 01:04:18.039 align:start position:0%
regular meetings are as normal which
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
um which would be the uh third
 
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
Friday of the month during the first six
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
months of the year uh because of session
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
in the second six months they would be
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
on Thursdays to avoid having you come in
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
during the summer on a
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
Friday the continued meetings are always
 
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
subject to change uh legislative
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
schedule may change uh we've tried to
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
avoid holidays but certainly those can
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
be changed on an ongoing
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
basis okay and and we would need a
 
01:04:59.309 --> 01:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
motion and to move to approve the dates
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
can okay move by Senator second by
 
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid any discussion on
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
these we did check and none of them are
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
on Easter which
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
is the most important floating holiday
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
spring okay any discussion those in
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
favor I
 
01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:23.069 align:start position:0%

01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:32.589 --> 01:05:32.599 align:start position:0%
19th yes I assuming that we're not
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
