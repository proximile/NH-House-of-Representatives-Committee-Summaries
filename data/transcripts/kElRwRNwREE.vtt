00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
in the case of lucky 7 the winnings w2g
 
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
is triggered when a player wins a prize
 
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
of 1200 or more minus the cost of the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
the check second change in the bill is
 
00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
in section 2 of the bill and it adds
 
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
licensed charity gaming facilities to to
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%

seven tickets
 
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
a charity selling lucky seven tickets at
 
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
a cherry gaming facility would be
 
00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
limited to
 
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
only 10 days per month
 
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
and there are others who are going to be
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
able to answer more technical questions
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
to these two changes
 
00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 align:start position:0%
if the committee has
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
has any
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
i do have five other bills that i have
 
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
to introduce so if it's
 
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
if it's okay for the chair if i could
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
scoot and and i'm also chair of energy
 
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
right now but i do have people that that
 
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
can ask you can
 
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
that would be fine
 
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:06.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
and the only other pink card
 
00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
is from rick newman

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.749 align:start position:0%
rick newman i represent the new
hampshire

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operators association
 
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
we do support the bill
 
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.550 align:start position:0%
we do support the bill
um

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
i just will quickly address the reasons
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
why the the first section of the bill
 
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
that deals with
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
the current requirement that all prizes
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
have to be paid
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
by check
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
uh does create some problems
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
uh in certain circumstances so think
 
00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:57.590 align:start position:0%
uh in certain circumstances so think
about

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
when a charity
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
is conducting uh selling lucky seven
 
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.110 align:start position:0%
is conducting uh selling lucky seven
tickets

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
at a facility
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh where the facility under current law
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
is allowed to for instance sell lucky
 
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
seven tickets from noon until
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh one in the morning i think it is
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
there's not always a charity person
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
present at that
 
00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 align:start position:0%
location necessarily and so if somebody
 
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
wins a prize how do you give them a
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
check the check has to come from the
 
00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:23.990 align:start position:0%
check the check has to come from the
charity

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
charity
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
and either the charity ends up leaving
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
signed checks behind which really isn't
 
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
a good idea
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
um or you know you got to tell a
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
customer you got to come back tomorrow
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
or you know and and the real reason for
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
wanting the check is documentation and
 
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
making sure that the lottery can keep
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
track of where the money goes and i
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
think you know adding eliminating the
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
check requirement and adding the w2g
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
uh requirement and make sure that that
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
documentation is available to the
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
lottery for audit covers the
 
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.710 align:start position:0%
lottery for audit covers the
documentation

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.830 align:start position:0%
documentation
issue

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
currently uh
 
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
well the second part of the bill allows
 
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.629 align:start position:0%
well the second part of the bill allows
uh

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
licensed charity gaming facilities under
 
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.950 align:start position:0%
licensed charity gaming facilities under
rsa287d

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
rsa287d
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
which are commonly known as poker rooms
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh to sell lucky seven tickets
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
now currently
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
they can do that but they have to get a
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
second license they have to get a
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
commercial bingo hall license to do that
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
and then they have to operate a bingo
 
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.909 align:start position:0%
and then they have to operate a bingo
game

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
game
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that there are at least
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
four facilities right now that are
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
charity gaming facilities that that do
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
that they sell lucky seven tickets on a
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
and they are they offer a bingo game
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
but nobody ever plays to bingo
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
i mean it's just you know they literally
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
open it up they
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
they they call for players players don't
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
come and then
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to offer the sale of
 
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
lucky seven tickets
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
it's cumbersome it costs money you pay
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
for a license that you don't need
 
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
you've got to have volunteers there that
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
you don't need
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
and so this change
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
would allow those facilities to sell the
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
lucky sevens without being required to
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
offer a bingo game it's the only it's
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's limited to the
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
potentially 16
 
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
games of chance facilities that the
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
state has as i said currently four of
 
00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:21.510 align:start position:0%
state has as i said currently four of
them

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
um do it i don't think all of them would
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
do it my guess is it'd probably be five
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
or six additional ones that would so we
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
do support the bill and we'd ask for
 
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.350 align:start position:0%
do support the bill and we'd ask for
your

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.190 align:start position:0%
your
support

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair thanks rick um
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.509 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
is would it would it allow uh electronic
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
transmission of the funds of the
 
00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
winnings to the
 
00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:54.389 align:start position:0%
winnings to the
charities

00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
charities
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
well you can do that you can do that you
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
can do that now okay you can do that now
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
the only uh the difference is it
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
eliminates the requirement
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
that it shall be paid by check
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
so you can you could do electronic funds
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
transfer or however you did it whether
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
you did it by cash or whatever
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
you would fill out a w-2g where
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate and then that documentation
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
would be available for audit
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
by the commission
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay that helps i got one more follow-up
 
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.509 align:start position:0%
okay that helps i got one more follow-up
so

00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay i agree with you that there's four
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
four of the charitable gaming 16
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming locations have
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
have bingo
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
and most of those also have the machines
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
not neces they're not there with the
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
pull tabs correct
 
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.509 align:start position:0%
pull tabs correct
um

00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
but but there's also so there's charlie
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
gaming locations there's bingo halls
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
that are licensed there's x number of
 
00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:48.630 align:start position:0%
that are licensed there's x number of
those

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
and then there's all the other uh
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
vfws lions clubs or whatever
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
that also offer bingo
 
00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.030 align:start position:0%
that also offer bingo
now

00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
would this change
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
is that this change only going to affect
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
the charitable gaming locations and not
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
to impact the others that's correct it
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
would only affect the charitable gaming
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
locations there are i believe 11
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
commercial bingo halls this bill does
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
not affect them in any way and last i
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
counted there were about 140
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
locations like vfws legions right
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
private clubs where they sell lucky
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
seven tickets and by the way just to be
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
clear in those locations you don't need
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
to have bingo to sell lucky seven you
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
just sell them from the time you open in
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
the morning till the time you close
 
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.310 align:start position:0%
the morning till the time you close
so

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.269 align:start position:0%
so
okay

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
one last question then mr chair so
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding you know a lot of
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
these locations
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
that have bingo i mean technically the
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
terrible locations that have bingo
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
have the machines
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
and my read is that they use them all
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
there's no way of monitoring that
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
how do they stop this customer going
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
there and using the machine
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh unless they turn them off but i don't
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
think they turn them off is that a quick
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
is that a correct assessment of what's
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
going on now that's correct that
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
basically says okay look let's just
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
let's just say let's get let's make that
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
what they're doing legal
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
is that is that correct yeah i think it
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
i mean it is the four locations that
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
have it i can tell you that i checked
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
with all of them
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
none of them have
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
like had a two-hour bingo game in the
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
last couple of years you know that's
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's they open it up they say we're
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
having bingo is available
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
nobody plays and then
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
they turn on the machine so
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
the term i used to hear when i was in
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
the house years ago is codifying what's
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
going on i mean codifying what's
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
actually happening in the industry
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
and allowing those facilities to have
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
them without having to go through
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
essentially the charade
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
of a bingo game that doesn't exist right
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
and mr chair
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
um okay but but you're saying it does
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's not going to impact bingo halls
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's not going to impact all the other
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations correct that
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay just wanted to make sure that thank
 
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.790 align:start position:0%
okay just wanted to make sure that thank
you

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative nunes thank you mr
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here uh the
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
w2g requirement that's a requirement
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
anyway isn't it yes okay so just
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
removing the excuse me follow up mr
 
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:17.910 align:start position:0%
removing the excuse me follow up mr
chair

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh removing the check doesn't stop that
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
information from going on over the way
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to that's correct it's
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
just that we're adding language here
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
that does say specifically that you have
 
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
to make that available to the lottery
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
so which i mean i would assume the
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
lottery could probably get that today
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
anyway if they wanted it but we're
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
making it clear in the statute that when
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
you have w2g information it's got to be
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
auditable by the lottery so they can see
 
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
represent almighty followed by
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative lang
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you on just follow up to that one
 
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.269 align:start position:0%
thank you on just follow up to that one
before

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
my real question
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
on i believe that the w2g requirement is
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
for six hundred dollars
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
so there would yes i'm being knotted at
 
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.829 align:start position:0%
so there would yes i'm being knotted at
by

00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
are different levels for each type of
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
gambling in the irs statute
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
and like for instance 600
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
is paramutual it's 300 times the bet or
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
600 right that's per
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
for lucky sevens
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
um it's twelve hundred dollars for poker
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
for instance it's five thousand dollars
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
so there are differing
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
categories which the irs designates and
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
i did double check that yesterday and
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
it's 1200 for 12 for lucky seven yeah
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
follow up just to follow up on that one
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's twelve hundred dollars for lucky
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
seven so there would be no documentation
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
other than the record of the cash prize
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
i know i had another question which is
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh these charitable gaming facilities i
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
think it's only eight of them are going
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to open up
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
these uh slot machines historic horse
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
racing machines
 
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.829 align:start position:0%
racing machines
on

00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:14:09.839 --> 00:14:11.030 align:start position:0%
on
on

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
i don't know why mine hasn't opened up
 
00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.350 align:start position:0%
i don't know why mine hasn't opened up
yet

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.949 align:start position:0%
yet
and

00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:17.750 align:start position:0%
and
that

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.430 align:start position:0%
that
this

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
lucky seven has been
 
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.189 align:start position:0%
lucky seven has been
transmogrified

00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
transmogrified
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
uh over the years into
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
a slow
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
version of a slot machine which legally
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
makes it not a slot machine but
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
it is essentially the same kind of thing
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's just what the player might want
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
there are there are facilities
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
where they probably wouldn't have them
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
at all i would as i said i don't think
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
all 16
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
would have the lucky sevens but there
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
would be places where people might
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
there'd be customers who are used to
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
playing them
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
they like the way they play they like
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
the different graphic or whatever it
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
might be so i could see a facility would
 
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.949 align:start position:0%
might be so i could see a facility would
have

00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
50 historic racing machines perhaps 10
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
or 15 lucky 7
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
machines in a separate part of the room
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
there may be some that wouldn't do it of
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
course but
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
and if a facility as you indicated
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative there may very well be
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
facilities that do not for whatever
 
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.590 align:start position:0%
facilities that do not for whatever
reason

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
end up having historic racing and in
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
those locations
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
having those lucky sevens available
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
important to them because it would give
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
the electronic opportunity for their
 
00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:37.030 align:start position:0%
the electronic opportunity for their
customers

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
customers
 
00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:38.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%

is this is i read this bill and i listen
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
to your testimony and i want to make
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
sure i'm clear and understanding what
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
the bill does this bill streamlines the
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
processes for the charity organizations
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
and will potentially increase the
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
revenues for the charity organization is
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
that a fair assessment what this bill
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
does it is thank you
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
for mr newman
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you mr chairman
 
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
i'm former representative fran
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
winderball and then i'll have
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody it's nice to be
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
back before you it's been a while
 
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.470 align:start position:0%
back before you it's been a while
um

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is fran wendell
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
beau i represent powerhouse gaming which
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
is an electronic gaming company
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
first off i have to say
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
we've had many discussions over the
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
years about slot machines and it's been
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
clearly established that lucky seven
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
machines are not slot machines i play
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
slot machines in vegas
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
and i've played
 
00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:06.710 align:start position:0%
and i've played
the

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
lucky seven electronic machines and
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
while they look similar
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
the whole concept
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
payouts and so on are totally totally
 
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.549 align:start position:0%
payouts and so on are totally totally
different

00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
electronic machines in new hampshire
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
are legal with the definition in
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
statutory law
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
and i will also add they're very
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
convenient versus those little paper
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
tickets that you have to
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
break open
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
i have
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
not great vision
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
and to see the results up on a well-lit
 
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.830 align:start position:0%
and to see the results up on a well-lit
screen

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
in big letters is a real advantage to me
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
i also have some
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
hand mobility issues
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
with my aging decrepitness
 
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.470 align:start position:0%
with my aging decrepitness
and

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
tearing open tickets is also very
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
difficult and the electronic saves you
 
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.950 align:start position:0%
difficult and the electronic saves you
that

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
i really don't have much to add to what
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
mr newman added he did a very clear job
 
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.830 align:start position:0%
mr newman added he did a very clear job
but

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative lang used the word
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
streamlining it's absolutely true that
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
this streamlines the process
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
it reminds me that maybe
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
one day in the legislature somebody said
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
we should require that they play music
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
by cassette deck one hour every day to
 
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.029 align:start position:0%
by cassette deck one hour every day to
have

00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
gaming charitable gaming
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
well i think i i don't know that many of
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
us regularly use cassette decks anymore
 
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.310 align:start position:0%
us regularly use cassette decks anymore
well

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
many of us don't play bingo anymore and
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
this system has involved evolved that
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
there are bingo halls they tend to be
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
bigger games they have bigger payouts
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
and people really go out of their way to
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
go to them specifically for bingo
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
this doesn't impact the local clubs that
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
they're mostly for social purposes but
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
it does get rid of having to go through
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
the game of saying okay bingo is open
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
nobody's there for bingo nobody's there
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
to listen to cassette music
 
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:09.990 align:start position:0%
to listen to cassette music
but

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
so it's time to update the processes
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
this committee has done many other areas
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
of charitable gaming over recent years
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
so um i ask that you support
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 316. and that's all i have
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
to add be happy to answer any questions
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for testimony questions from
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman mr mcintyre
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
do you have anything to
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh good morning mr chairman members of
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
the committee uh
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
my name is charlie mcintyre a privilege
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
of being director of the lottery and
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
with me is
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
valerie king our director of licensing
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
and enforcement
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
we neither support nor oppose this bill
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
certainly but happy to answer your
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
questions of technical nature you folks
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair a simple question uh
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
mr uh mcintyre
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
why is lucky seven and bingo linked in
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form i don't understand
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
the logic
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
that would be historical when val was
 
00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:43.270 align:start position:0%
that would be historical when val was
there

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
minus one point
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
but yeah it is just historical because
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
they were traditionally the paper
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
tickets that some of the tickets are
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
played in conjunction with a bingo game
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
so it's just
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
so basically there's no logical reason
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for it to stay that
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.549 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
welcome

00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh in the fiscal note
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
you say and i'm sure you wrote this it
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
says it would likely reduce the number
 
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
of games of chance facilities that
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
offer bingo games
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
as many many of these games are
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
presently offered only for the purpose
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
of winning lucky seven sales
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
but again
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about just the games of
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
chance hall the 16 games of chance halls
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
which don't really do bingo anyway right
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
and if they do it's to very little
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
amounts so it would be it would be a
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
decrease but not material decrease i
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
think is the way we would describe it
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up i just want to ask
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
both of you
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
being the experts
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
again this just impacts the charitable
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
gaming halls not the bingo halls or the
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
or the other organizations that you play
 
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.430 align:start position:0%
or the other organizations that you play
bingo

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
bingo
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
from your reading of the bill i i which
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
part are you referring to the 500 checks
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
taking away the bingo requirement yeah
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
right they would still be able to at the
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
bingo hall still be able to play them in
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
conjunction they could have the paper
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
tickets they can have the electronic
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
tickets so this wouldn't negatively
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
impact anyone i guess follow-up i just
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
want to restate it then so
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
this bill for the charitable hud
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
basically says you don't need bingo to
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
do play lucky seven
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
but that would not that that doesn't
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
transcend over to the other two
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
categories that you're still going to
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
need bingo to sell lucky seven at the
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
other facilities
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
bingo halls correct because this only
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
allowed you to sell them so in the end
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to sell them at your
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
fraternal halls you'll be able to sell
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
them at your bingo halls and now you'll
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
be able to also sell them at your games
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
of chance halls
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
but follow up and show me sure i
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
understand this
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
so at the fraternal halls and at the
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
bingo halls and there's what 15 of those
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
and this
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
endless number of fraternal halls
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that they couldn't
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
sell lucky seven unless they had bingo
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
going on is that correct correct and
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
that will not change that will not
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
change okay that's all i want to know
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
and

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.750 align:start position:0%
 
first

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
i just want to ask on if this is a
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
correct way to explain it
 
00:23:46.159 --> 00:23:47.190 align:start position:0%
correct way to explain it
the

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
lucky seven tickets used to be something
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
that was integral to bingo
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
bingo is a paper game lucky seven
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
tickets were a paper game
 
00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:00.630 align:start position:0%
tickets were a paper game
now

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
lucky seven has been almost entirely
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
turned into a machine game
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
which increases addiction
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
on and um
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
and so there is no longer a reason to
 
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.990 align:start position:0%
and so there is no longer a reason to
to

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
certainly i think we agree with the
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
first two clauses of your sentence
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
comment but the second two certainly
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
i think we do
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of lucky seven sort of
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
traditional paper sales i think it's at
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
least half of
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
our existing
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
lucky seven
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
sales so to suggest that it's done away
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
with it is is just not not this is
 
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.510 align:start position:0%
with it is is just not not this is
inaccurate

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
inaccurate
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
and i know that
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
the folks who do sell bingo tickets
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
derive significantly more revenue from
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
lucky sales 57 sales than they do bingo
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
and they use the paper tickets these
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
paper tickets yeah
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
and my
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
my real question that i had
 
00:25:00.559 --> 00:25:01.669 align:start position:0%
my real question that i had
was

00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:02.710 align:start position:0%
was
on

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
if we go
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
from a five hundred dollar
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
limit requiring documentation to a
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred dollar
 
00:25:11.679 --> 00:25:12.950 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred dollar
limit

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
requiring documentation does that bother
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
you at all
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
certainly not the 500 limit is rather
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
unnatural um
 
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.029 align:start position:0%
unnatural um
the

00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
we as a lottery are amongst those the
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
largest in the state in terms of having
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
to be compliant with federal tax code uh
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
we're under gambling
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
and we over comply for example like we
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
regardless of how much you pay for your
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
ticket we will give you a w-2g at 600
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
even though it might be less than 300
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
times the wager as mr
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
500 dollars may have been a lot of money
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
back in the day it is not now for us so
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
concern us obviously it's a paper trail
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
is what we're looking for
 
00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.470 align:start position:0%
is what we're looking for
to

00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
make sure money hasn't been laundered is
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
important to us but at these levels
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
you're not talking
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
money laundering is an issue
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
and also it just removes the requirement
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
for the check it doesn't mean we can't
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
representative lyon
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr director so would you
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
characterize the same way we talked
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
about before that this is a streamlining
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
bill to bring things into compliance
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
with federal code and also potentially
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
will generate more revenue for charities
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
across the state yeah certainly um it
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
also does away with what we used to call
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
ghost bingo which was they did a bingo
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
game when they opened that was the only
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
bingo game they did
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
it was you know just
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
it was to comply with a statue that was
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
it didn't serve a purpose so yes
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
understand thank you thank you mr chair
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
any further questions seeing none thank
 
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.350 align:start position:0%
any further questions seeing none thank
you

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%

00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
i'm here to introduce today briefly
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
senate bill 318.
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
this bill as
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
was read is the extension of games of
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
chance of operations
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
and it's to allow the hours to change to
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
accommodate more people who are
 
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
interested in gaming
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
and participating it changes the hours
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
from 11 a.m back down to 8 a.m and from
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
1 a.m to 4 a.m the following day uh
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
simple bill and there are people behind
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
me that would like to take you right
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
would you answer any questions i
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
certainly would represent
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you senator
 
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
french for taking my question simple
 
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.549 align:start position:0%
french for taking my question simple
question

00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
um municipal rules ordinances would
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
override this so if a municipality said
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
an ordinance that says
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
our businesses can only stop until 2am
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
would that would that override
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
which municipalities have that well i
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
know i believe it's out in the seacoast
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
right now they have some
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
ordinances relative to
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
um establishments past 1am
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
and so my question is a local ordinance
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
would take precedent in this case so
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
while we allow it though they could
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
create more stringent rules i
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure uh i'm really not i know
 
00:29:36.159 --> 00:29:37.190 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure uh i'm really not i know
there's

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
i didn't know municipalities had on and
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
it says like 24-hour gas stations are
 
00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:44.070 align:start position:0%
it says like 24-hour gas stations are
open

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh 24-hour restaurants are open i am not
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
any that have that regulation but those
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
behind me could probably answer that
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
actually i was just pointing out that he
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
asked the question that that i had but
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
would you mind if we just made sure that
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
the municipals could overrule that
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
since a all-night
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
gambling hall
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
in a place that closed down regularly by
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
1am or earlier
 
00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:28.230 align:start position:0%
1am or earlier
was

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
not able to
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
keep people up
 
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
downtowns now that have
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
it would be up to you sure
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you

uh
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
the change from 1 a.m to 4 a.m
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
what is the reasoning behind that
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
pretty much to accommodate
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
various working schedules for people
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
representatives question
 
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
if we're going to open it and expand it
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
those extra six hours why not go to 24
 
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.310 align:start position:0%
those extra six hours why not go to 24
7.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
7.
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to make that as an
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
amendment i'm sure it'd be acceptable
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering about the traffic or
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
the flow coming through or is it
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
different or
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
i personally don't go to these gaming
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
places so i don't know
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
nor do i thank you thank you

thank you for taking our questions um i
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
guess um i'm i'm looking at maybe uh
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
splitting the difference here and maybe
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
earlier is fine to help schedules but
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
going to 4am i guess i'd be concerned
 
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:09.990 align:start position:0%
going to 4am i guess i'd be concerned
about

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
more people
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
driving late possibly drunk um
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
to four a.m
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about the liquor laws but
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
isn't uh
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%

i came here yes it's it's 1am so
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
actually it would give them time to
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
have a night shift
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
no the hours division
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:08.830 align:start position:0%
the hours for uh serving would remain
the

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%

from powerhouse
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you again for the record fran
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
wendell beau um new hampton representing
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
powerhouse gaming
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know i think this is what in the old
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
days we called enabling legislation
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
i doubt
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
any facility other than maybe right on
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
the border
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
with massachusetts or summertime in the
 
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.029 align:start position:0%
with massachusetts or summertime in the
seacoast

00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
seacoast
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
would do this i i really
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
can't imagine up in berlin them opening
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
a facility that would be open until four
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning um so i i think
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
it would be limited it wouldn't be the
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
usual um i can tell you however when
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
i've been in vegas and haven't been able
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
to fall asleep i've not been you know
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
get up and go down and gamble a little
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
and then go back up and go to bed so but
 
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.389 align:start position:0%
and then go back up and go to bed so but
that's

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
that's vegas i mean and even then the
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
place is empty although i will tell you
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
i ran into former representative david
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
lawton at three o'clock in the morning
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
um at one of these vegas casinos but to
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
compare what we have in new hampshire
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
even the biggest facility is such a far
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
stretch i think that they'll come to
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
realize that there's not going to be a
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
lot of people wanting to gamble at 3 00
 
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.670 align:start position:0%
lot of people wanting to gamble at 3 00
a.m

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
a.m
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
it enables them to do so if they find a
 
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:05.750 align:start position:0%
it enables them to do so if they find a
market

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a lot of market but
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposed to expanded hours thank
 
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.750 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposed to expanded hours thank
you

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:35:13.839 --> 00:35:16.390 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
representative

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
on we have a major labor shortage which
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
is going to be continuing for some time
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
i think again enabling legislation
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
obviously if you can't get people to
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
staff it you're not going to take the
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
option of staying later perhaps it might
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
be something on a friday night saturday
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
night would be the only nights they'd
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
even begin to consider it but again i
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
view this mainly as enabling legislation
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
i doubt many will take us up on it
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative romney
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
so again
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
4 a.m that just seems
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
so on new hampshire i mean we have
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
liquor liquor sales to 1 o'clock we're
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
not new york city where the bars close
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
at four in the morning
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
we're not vegas
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
and this is terrible gaming we gotta
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
let's not forget this is terrible gaming
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
this is not big casino gaming
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
so i i i'm just trying to understand and
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
like i agree with you i mean this is
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
it's enabling it says it's uh it doesn't
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
say shall
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
it says may
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
so they the organizations can do what
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
they want but i i think
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i just don't like the
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
appearance of us
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
keeping these open until four
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh do you
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
you personally obviously don't have a
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
problem with that
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh staying up to four
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
i often go to bed about then um
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
you know there are people who are
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
employed that get out of work at
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
midnight one o'clock in the morning and
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
often a lot of times those people have
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
to unwind for a while before they're
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
ready to actually go to bed
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
people like that i think would take
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
advantage of this
 
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
facilities that would take advantage of
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
it i think like i said
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
probably not many of them and it might
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
just be limited to weekends holidays
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
summertime but i don't think in the
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
middle of the winter most of these would
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
be wanting to be open till four in the
 
00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.589 align:start position:0%
be wanting to be open till four in the
morning

00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.310 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
representatively

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
representatively
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
nonetheless snowed in
 
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.390 align:start position:0%
nonetheless snowed in
um

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
previously it was asked whether or not
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
town ordinances would override
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh another bill would town ordinances
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
override the permissibility that is
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
granted in this bill so if a town says
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
every business has to close at two
 
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.230 align:start position:0%
every business has to close at two
o'clock

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
then representative owerry in that
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
situation personally
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
not speaking for my client personally i
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
think that even though we're not a home
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
rule state i think the local ordinance
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
should take precedent and um i certainly
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
think if you wanted to put
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
something in there if there is a
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
specific ordinance the ordinance would
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
take precedent
 
00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.069 align:start position:0%
take precedent
um

00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
but that would be a town vote and and so
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
on i don't think many towns would object
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
they've already approved charitable
 
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
gaming in their location but it's
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
something definitely to consider
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am
 
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.190 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am
representative

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.790 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
do you can you tell us
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
historically why they may have
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
originally done the uh 11 a.m to 1 p.m
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
do you have why those were chosen
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
i think some wise legislator back in the
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
days decided that those were appropriate
 
00:38:59.359 --> 00:39:01.349 align:start position:0%
days decided that those were appropriate
hours

00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's i don't think maybe the lottery
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
would have
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
additional information i when it was a
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
starting point it was like anything new
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
for example lottery
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire led the path on scratch
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
tickets well back then scratch tickets
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
were much different and they have
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
evolved over time and i think this is
 
00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:24.310 align:start position:0%
evolved over time and i think this is
just

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
another indication of evolving
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
to expand ours they
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
they picked a number and thought what
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
was reasonable back then but as we know
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
my my has the world changed since that
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
was enacted
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
rob's unknowns
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you ms
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
wendell both for being here for us today
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you um
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
many years ago when i was a youngster i
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
worked the night shift for several years
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
my hours were from 10 at night to six in
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
the morning and there was one bar in our
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
neighborhood that opened at six o'clock
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
in the morning so all of us would get
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
off work and we would go over there at
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
six o'clock in the morning have a drink
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
and then go home
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
this is sort of similar to that someone
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
may work until midnight and then want to
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
go in they may not be able to make it by
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
one o'clock in the morning if they
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to go participate in charitable
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
gaming for an hour
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
so this just extends those hours so they
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
may have an availability to do that
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
exactly thank you
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm not sure you'll be
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
answering this question i'm put on my
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
zoning board chairman hat that i wear
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes my question is this when
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
businesses go in
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
to a given municipality they generally
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
have to go through a planning board
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
process and get a site plan review and
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
one of the things that generally deals
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
with is parking and hours of operation
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
and that's set in the business rules
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
that allows them to get their their
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
certificate of occupancy or whatever it
 
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
is they have to get so my question is
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
that even if we extended these hours and
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
the site plan review was done by a given
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
municipality that set the hours of
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
operation as part of that site plan any
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
business that was looking to take
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
advantage of this would have to go get a
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
modification at the local level for that
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
site plan review to increase the hours
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's normally how it's done i would
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
agree thank you
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%

many of the questions touched on the
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
points i was going to make and i don't
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
want to take up your time but i will
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
tell you the
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
question of uh representative almy asked
 
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.510 align:start position:0%
question of uh representative almy asked
about

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know is there anybody looking for
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
this does somebody want this
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
and the answer that is clearly yes um
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
many of
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
the game operators as
 
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.750 align:start position:0%
the game operators as
uh

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
fran windable said
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
are on the southern tier of the state
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
and compete directly
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
these days and will compete even more
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
once historic racing is operating which
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
is going to happen in the next probably
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
two three four months we're going to
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
start seeing that come out from a bill
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
that you folks passed a year ago and
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
when that happens
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
that competition is going to be even
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
more direct and it and they compete
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
directly with
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
you know the everett casino
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
and as representative nunez pointed out
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
and i myself were in that boat when i
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
was a state representative here in 1979
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh and in the 80s i drove a taxi in
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
portsmouth and i got out i left here
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
during the day went home
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
drove cab from five to midnight at one
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning and that's when i
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
got out of work so
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
i totally i've always sympathized with
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
people who work you know the odd shift
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
not everybody works eight to five
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
and uh so what we see now is
 
00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.390 align:start position:0%
and uh so what we see now is
uh

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
losing customers who will get out of
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
work at midnight and it's not a far
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
drive down to everett it's an easy drive
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
at that time of the night so once you
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
lose a customer in the gambling business
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
like in any other entertainment business
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes you lose them forever that
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
means you're going to lose them on
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
saturday afternoon too they're going to
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
become a part of the rewards program
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
at whether it's oxford casino in maine
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
or the everett casino and that's where
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
they are become a loyal customer to
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
and i think this gives the ability to
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
those facilities that want to and see an
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to keep those customers here
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire giving money to
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
charities to the state and to our game
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
operators and our employees
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
i will also say uh that i totally agree
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
that not every room is going to do this
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
i mean it just won't make sense for
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
every room to do it but it certainly
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
makes sense for every room to have the
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity i could foresee for instance
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
a place like belmont where
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
they probably wouldn't do it on a
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
regular basis but on a
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps a new year's eve
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
event or some other special event maybe
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
during nascar weekend
 
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.710 align:start position:0%
during nascar weekend
when

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
you have a hundred thousand people up
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
there going to races i could see them
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
extending their hours for those periods
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
of time and those would be
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know they could be very lucrative
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know for those reasons we would
 
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
ask that you
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh support the bill
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
and one other point i want to make is
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
thinking about the differences because
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
every room is different so hampton beach
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
for instance the operator down there
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
said to me you know i'd i probably
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't and oh that brings me to
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative wang
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
and i think the answer to your question
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
in my opinion is that yeah the municipal
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
ordinance would certainly take
 
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.790 align:start position:0%
ordinance would certainly take
precedence

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
precedence
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
hampton is a very good example of that
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
they have an ordinance that businesses
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
of entertainment
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
have to close at 1am
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
and so my operator down there said to me
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
you know this wouldn't i wouldn't be
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
extending my hours but
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
on a rainy day in july when when the
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
tourists are at hampton beach at eight
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
nine ten o'clock in the morning with
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
nothing to do i could see opening up for
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
breakfast having a breakfast tournament
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
or you know breakfast uh gaming having
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
peeps something for people to do so
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
hampton would probably be one that would
 
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the earlier opening
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
and not not the later opening
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
so just thinking about the differences
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
of all the rooms i think
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
this will be beneficial to everybody
 
00:45:33.119 --> 00:45:35.589 align:start position:0%
this will be beneficial to everybody
involved

00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative rodney thanks chair thank

you mentioned encore in oxford so
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
what are the regulations in
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and maine are they allowed
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
to stay open 24 hours they are
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
24 hours a day thank you
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.230 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
i i guess i'm still concerned about the
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
back and forth on ours and i mean
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
municipal ordinances in particular and
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.150 align:start position:0%
what uh
what

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
what uh is the governing
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
rule in the event of the
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
place that has an ordinance that
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
specifically limits the time for this
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
kind of establishment to
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
let's say 1am
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
and then along comes this bill that says
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:46:31.119 --> 00:46:31.990 align:start position:0%
um that
the

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.990 align:start position:0%
the
facility

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh running these kinds of games may stay
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
open until
 
00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.589 align:start position:0%
open until
4pm

00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
4pm
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
4 am it's a direct conflict with a
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
municipal ordinance
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
and if i were
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
in your shoes
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
i would want legal advice in that
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
situation and it seems to me that
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
if we're going to go forward with this
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
then it's really important to put in
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
here a municipal option
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
that makes clear you know
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
that there is a way to
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
solve this problem and avoid conflict
 
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.589 align:start position:0%
solve this problem and avoid conflict
by

00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
enabling municipalities
 
00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.790 align:start position:0%
enabling municipalities
to

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.230 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
well enabling facility operators
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
to comply with a municipal or ordinance
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
if it's set at a lower level
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't i i don't think i'd
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily disagree uh representative
 
00:47:29.839 --> 00:47:30.630 align:start position:0%
necessarily disagree uh representative
that

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.510 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
if there were some language i'd just be
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
concerned i'd want the language to be
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
broad and not uh carving out uh charity
 
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.349 align:start position:0%
broad and not uh carving out uh charity
gaming

00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh but like for instance i've read the
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
hampton ordinance it covers all it's got
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
a it defines what entertainment is it
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
covers it says dance and singing music
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing service of food
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
um so clearly hampton
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know that's been in place for a long
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
time so they have the ability to do that
 
00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.430 align:start position:0%
time so they have the ability to do that
now

00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
um if a community wanted to
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
enact something like that
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
um my guess is my people would
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
voluntarily go along with it anyway
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
because they want good relations with
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
the municipality they're not going to
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
want to get into a war over the three
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
hours but uh
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
but i don't think you should carve out
 
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.950 align:start position:0%
but i don't think you should carve out
one

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.069 align:start position:0%
one
business

00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative nunes
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
oh representative alani yes i don't
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%

00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:37.829 align:start position:0%
really understand what you're saying
on

00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.349 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
these

00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
games of chance
 
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.829 align:start position:0%
games of chance
on

00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
would you be saying that we ought
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
ought to just pass a law saying that all
 
00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:53.910 align:start position:0%
ought to just pass a law saying that all
municipalities

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
laws about when they can businesses can
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
be open are
 
00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.990 align:start position:0%
be open are
uh

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
are going to
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
preempt any
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
state law
 
00:49:05.359 --> 00:49:06.870 align:start position:0%
state law
no

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%

i want to stop i want to be careful i'm
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%

pretend to be one
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%

else

00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.559 --> 00:49:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
committee i thought maybe i could help
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
solve some some of the questions my name
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
is robert clegg i'm representing boston
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
billiards in nashua
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that for a fact
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill stops anybody in
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
any town from saying no
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
whatever the current ordinances are
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
zoning regulations planning board
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
whatever they still have to be complied
 
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:09.670 align:start position:0%
whatever they still have to be complied
with

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
the only thing that they have to do is
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
go in and ask for a change in their
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
hours if they want one
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
and no town i don't see anything in this
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
bill that would force a town to say yes
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
as far as why do they want the extra
 
00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:23.910 align:start position:0%
as far as why do they want the extra
hours

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned here a lot of people
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
get out of work at 11 o'clock
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
they don't have any place to go
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
some of them like to go to the gaming
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
places they can still get a sandwich
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
they can get a drink
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
and get a coke too and they can play
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
cards and try to unwind
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not vegas
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
but it's a place that's pretty friendly
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
the bedding is is low
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
so people are just looking online and
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
you know i've met some guys at some of
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
these locations that were on the
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
ambulance all day
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
and if you're on the ambulance
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
all day and you're picking up people
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
that have opioid
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
issues and and you're picking up
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
accident victims you need some place to
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
go before you go home
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
and all these guys are doing is saying
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
let us keep going for that second and
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
third shift
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
but but i guess the biggest concern is
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not the ordinances on the
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
local level stay they stay just as they
 
00:51:18.079 --> 00:51:18.950 align:start position:0%
local level stay they stay just as they
are

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
no community gives up its ability to
 
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.870 align:start position:0%
no community gives up its ability to
regulate

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
the businesses whatsoever
 
00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:26.559 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions if you have any
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
missed channel
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay any questions represent alani
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%

00:51:37.359 --> 00:51:38.230 align:start position:0%

00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
a local mall that is semi-residential
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
semi-residential with subsidized people
 
00:51:47.599 --> 00:51:48.470 align:start position:0%
semi-residential with subsidized people
and

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.710 align:start position:0%
and
on

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
we were not allowed
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
by the law that passed
 
00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.549 align:start position:0%
by the law that passed
to

00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
rethink the idea that
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
this was going to turn into a slot
 
00:52:03.839 --> 00:52:05.829 align:start position:0%
this was going to turn into a slot
parlor

00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
parlor
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
which it will in a few months
 
00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.710 align:start position:0%
which it will in a few months
and

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
i do not understand why
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
in this particular law
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
the locals would be allowed
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
to prevail
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
it worked interesting
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
all night
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
could you explain that to me i
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
understand the question mr chairman i'm
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
going to say that the community that you
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
speak of didn't have an ordinance
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
already in place
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
so when the law came in and allowed for
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
the for the program or for the for the
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
operation of any particular business
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
because you had nothing that said it
 
00:52:43.359 --> 00:52:44.470 align:start position:0%
because you had nothing that said it
couldn't

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
you were told that they could
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
um any community can can make ordinances
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
but anybody that's in there is
 
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.549 align:start position:0%
but anybody that's in there is
grandfathered

00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
grandfathered
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
so the idea that the poker room became
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
something else was because even after
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
you let it in
 
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
before it expanded
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
there doesn't appear to be and i i don't
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
know what your town is but
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
more than likely nobody went in there
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
and said it can't get any bigger than
 
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:11.829 align:start position:0%
and said it can't get any bigger than
this

00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
if that's the case then a
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
a community that doesn't have that prior
 
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.069 align:start position:0%
a community that doesn't have that prior
ordinance

00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
would not be able to
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
say no to a game of chance organization
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
that wanted to run games until four a.m
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the of the system is
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
that if your community doesn't choose to
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
regulate it then it runs unregulated and
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
that's for anything whether it's a game
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
of chance or or um
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
a representative line followed by
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
representing early
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay so we're getting a little little
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
confusing here now i want to try to make
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
sure i'm clear on what we're talking
 
00:54:03.599 --> 00:54:04.710 align:start position:0%
sure i'm clear on what we're talking
about

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
from from your testimony it sounds like
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
a business that's gone through a site
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
plan review through the planning board
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
when they want to open a business they
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
go to the planning board say i'm opening
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
my business and they go through a site
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
plan review part of that site plan
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
review can include hours of operation
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to change those hours of
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
operation based on the new law they
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
would have to go back in front of the
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
planning board
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
in order to get a modification to the
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
site plan review is that what your
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
testimony was
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
planning board or board of aldermen
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
anybody who has the authority to make
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
the changes based on whatever zone
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
they're in yes thank you
 
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.549 align:start position:0%
they're in yes thank you
representative

00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
would you believe that in a amendment to
 
00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.829 align:start position:0%
would you believe that in a amendment to
this

00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
indicating what you just said that
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill shall
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh prohibit the local
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
community ordinances from overriding the
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
hours of operation
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
in some general terminology
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
would do you believe that the proponents
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill would find that uh
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
generally acceptable
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it depends on what you say
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
because if the way you said it if that's
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
what you put in
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
and they decide in two years to change
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
the hours does that mean i now have to
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
to give up my time you know you know
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
what i do for a living this is just my
 
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.309 align:start position:0%
what i do for a living this is just my
fun

00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
when when i build a facility or i
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
convert a facility into something
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
i need to make sure that those people
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
for five years have
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
what it is they thought they had so if
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying that somebody can make an
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
ordinance after the fact and now it
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
affects me i'd have an issue with that
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
all right follow up well let's take a
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
concrete example we're both familiar
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
with there's so a mall in our town
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
it's got this nice facility that would
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
make a very nice bar or
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
a gaming
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
facility the site plan for that
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
property says uh
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
eight to
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
nine or something like that hours of
 
00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.109 align:start position:0%
nine or something like that hours of
operation

00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
that would essentially prevent anyone
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
from using
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
one of those storefronts
 
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operation would that
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
be correct
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
unless they had the ability to go before
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
the boards the zoning board of the
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
planning board in our town and make
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
their case and somebody thought it was
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
the best use of the property
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
and of course anybody that was in that
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
area who was in a butter of any sort
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
would also be able to come to the the
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
planning board and the zoning board to
 
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
express whether they thought it was a
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
good idea or thought it was a bad idea
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
well if any of the neighbors of st
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
patrick's cemetery came to the planning
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
you're all set yes thank you sir
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
schamberg thank you mr chairman
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
can constitutionally can the legislature
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
draft legislation that could overrule
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
what representative lang has been
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
stating about
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
the town or the city says hey
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to shut down at one o'clock
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature only
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns only have
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
the power that the legislature grants
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
them so if the legislature decided to
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
take away their ability to have zoning
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
and planning
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
they could write a law and they could
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
take away
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
all the power of this of the the local
 
00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.390 align:start position:0%
all the power of this of the the local
communities

establishing a committee to study room
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
occupancy tax revenue
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
and fees and the formula for
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
distribution to municipalities
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
is the prime sponsor and
 
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
before you leave senator could you fill
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman members of the
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee erin hennessey i am the state
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
center for district one which is the
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
northern half of grafton county and all
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
of coast county
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
i brought this bill forward at the
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
request of one of my beautiful towns
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
gorham in north eastern coast county
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
they are a small town that has a lot of
 
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:41.670 align:start position:0%
they are a small town that has a lot of
different

00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
destination attractions they have um
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
and so they have a lot of hotel rooms
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
and even though this legislative
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
legislature did some great work
 
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
last year with uh senator rashady's work
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
on sb 99 in the inclusion of 30 percent
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
back to our towns in meals and rooms
 
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.349 align:start position:0%
back to our towns in meals and rooms
revenues

01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think there's still more work that we
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
can do in identifying where those
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
specifically rooms revenues come from
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
and helping to send those revenues back
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
to the towns that send that money to the
 
01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.430 align:start position:0%
to the towns that send that money to the
state

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
rooms revenues
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
put more of a
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
burden on our localities because of the
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that involves from
 
01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.109 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that involves from
sidewalks

01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
sidewalks
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
local roads
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
and also first responder expenses that
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
these these
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
cause to our local communities
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
and so this is a study committee
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that this
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislature did and i i think it was
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
back in maybe 16 and some of you may
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
have been a part of that study committee
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
was actually studied this previously but
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue at that time
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
did not have a system in place that
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
could identify where room's revenue
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to report that the rim
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
system is in place and the department
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
now can collect that information however
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
the way that they collect the
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
information is not done that way right
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
now so you could own three different
 
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
hotels across new hampshire
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
and report your revenue from your
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
business office not in any of those
 
01:01:18.799 --> 01:01:19.910 align:start position:0%
business office not in any of those
locations

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
locations
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
so we don't know where the actual
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
revenue is coming from so this study
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
committee will take a look at
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
studying modifying the tax revenue
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
distribution formula
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
for room occupancy based on where the
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
revenue is collected
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
it'll look at taxpayer information
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
requirements that would be need to be
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
mandated to facilitate the modification
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
of revenue distribution
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
it'll look at identifying the cost to
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue administration
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
to ch change forms and systems to
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
collect that tax location data
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
identifying barriers if any for
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to report data by location
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
and it also does one other thing it um
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
the senate amended this bill to
 
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.750 align:start position:0%
the senate amended this bill to
incorporate

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
incorporate
 
01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.870 align:start position:0%
incorporate
a

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
bill from the senator from district five
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
looking at the impact of a two dollar
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
municipal occupancy fee and how that fee
 
01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
would be reported collected and managed
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
by the municipality
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative romney yeah thank you mr
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
chair thank you senator appreciate you
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
being here
 
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.789 align:start position:0%
being here
so

01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
we get this well this is a this is a
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
commission a study committee bill
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
but we get this kind of bill about every
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
other year uh requesting these these
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
things one of two things either
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
reallocate the way the uh rooms tax is
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
allocated back to the towns
 
01:02:41.039 --> 01:02:42.150 align:start position:0%
allocated back to the towns
or

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
which is the your your roman five which
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
is the the amendment that happened in
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
your committee
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
the two dollar
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
add-on tax uh hampton and portsmouth
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
push for this all the time
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
so i i'm just trying to understand why
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
we want to have a study on this versus
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
just file a bill and let us fight it out
 
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.190 align:start position:0%
just file a bill and let us fight it out
again

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh i mean again we we've been here for
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
those of us who've been around for a
 
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
while we've we've dealt with this issue
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
i guess the new piece of information is
 
01:03:09.039 --> 01:03:10.309 align:start position:0%
i guess the new piece of information is
the

01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
is the revenue uh the rim system
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
because that has always especially when
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
it came to meals it was all the meals
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
part of the tax it was always very
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
separate out
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know a guy owns
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
you know 50 dunkin donuts he reports it
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
in one location
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know i i i know you're
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
doing this for a stitch when it sounds
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
do you feel the study is really going to
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
be change anything i i guess you do you
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
filed a bill but yeah
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question i think
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
that the questions that you just posed
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
would result in this committee saying we
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
don't have all the information we've
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
just heard from a bunch of businesses
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
that this would be hard on them to
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
change the way they report their revenue
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
to the state we heard from the
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
department of revenue that this is going
 
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.349 align:start position:0%
department of revenue that this is going
to

01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps cost something and i don't know
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
the answer to that to change their
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
system or to what the timeline would be
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
for different businesses in the state to
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
file this information what the forms
 
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
would need to be changed
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
and then you get all that information
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
and you'll be like i don't think this
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
bill is ready for prime time i think we
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
actually need to study this hear from
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
the different
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in the state to find out
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what it would take for them to
 
01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.029 align:start position:0%
exactly what it would take for them to
file

01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
file
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
the forms appropriately so that we can
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
identify as a state where our revenues
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
is coming from and i think that's
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
another thing in general that the
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to look at is when we
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
make decisions
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't actually know exactly
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
where all of our revenue is coming from
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that gorham sends a lot
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
of revenue back and they do not get they
 
01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:43.510 align:start position:0%
of revenue back and they do not get they
don't

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
based on what the town has told me in
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax they get back what
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
one restaurant in gorham pays
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
and that's that's very difficult to for
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
the town
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah thank you
 
01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.029 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah thank you
so

01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
so if we do it for this tax
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
she i guess the question becomes should
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
we do it for every tax you know
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
a good example would be cigarette
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
sales we know there's a lot more
 
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
cigarette sales that go on on the border
 
01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.990 align:start position:0%
cigarette sales that go on on the border
towns

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
like like the chairman's place style i i
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
see it myself in portsmouth people come
 
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:17.750 align:start position:0%
see it myself in portsmouth people come
and

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
with the register that has all the
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
cartons of cigarettes people are buying
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
because they're coming from other
 
01:05:23.039 --> 01:05:24.470 align:start position:0%
because they're coming from other
locales

01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
locales
 
01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.510 align:start position:0%
locales
so

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
so should those towns argue the same
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
thing you know well we sell more
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
cigarettes so we should get more of the
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
cigarette revenue i think that's you see
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's a slippery slope a little
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
bit yep no that's a great point as a
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
district that
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
um borders vermont maine and canada i'd
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
be happy for you to include that in this
 
01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.630 align:start position:0%
be happy for you to include that in this
bill

01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
okay that wasn't my attention but thank
 
01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.589 align:start position:0%
okay that wasn't my attention but thank
you

01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
next is greg moore
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
representing american for prosperity in
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
anybody else we're so that's another
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's the next bill
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
that's the next bill
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
 
01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:27.589 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
later

01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:06:27.599 --> 01:06:29.270 align:start position:0%
later
okay

01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
i wasn't going to speak on this because
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
i knew senator hennessey would really
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
cover everything but i think the
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
difference between cigarette taxes
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
and rooms and meals tax is that the
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
revenue is that comes back to places
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
like gorham is based on their population
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
so they have a tremendous number of
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
people who come
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
mostly in the summer but more and more
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
year round
 
01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.309 align:start position:0%
year round
and

01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
they have hotels
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
not that many restaurants but a lot of
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
hotel rooms motel rooms now airbnb
 
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.470 align:start position:0%
hotel rooms motel rooms now airbnb
and

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
 
01:07:07.039 --> 01:07:08.549 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
and

01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
they get very little because their
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
population is really quite
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
small and that that isn't true that
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
there's a relationship between
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
cigarette it goes into
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the population so
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
towns in cowas county particularly
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
and in upper grafton
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of expenses
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
to do with
 
01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.390 align:start position:0%
to do with
um

01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.990 align:start position:0%
um
hosting

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
hosting
 
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.069 align:start position:0%

01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
visitors
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
including police
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
first responders as she said
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
and they get very little back
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
for what they spend and it's
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
those things are listed in the town
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
report you know and all the state
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
forms that list it so
 
01:07:57.359 --> 01:07:58.470 align:start position:0%
forms that list it so
residents

01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
residents
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
in addition to the selectmen
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
and the treasurer people like that
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
residents are very aware of what they
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
see as a large disparity
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
i think there may be a difference
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
between what is reasonable
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
payback to these towns from rooms
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
and meals and we really don't know that
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
that i think is very much part of the
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
study so i that's why i'm on this as a
 
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.470 align:start position:0%
study so i that's why i'm on this as a
co-sponsor

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
certainly hope that you endorse this
 
01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.149 align:start position:0%
certainly hope that you endorse this
study

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
would you take questions oh yes
 
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative lyon
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
so i guess when i'm looking at this bill
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
i know we've heard
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
i believe you were on the committee my
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
first term and and we heard this we
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
heard the two dollar bill uh two dollar
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
tax bill on municipalities allowing that
 
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:52.950 align:start position:0%
tax bill on municipalities allowing that
before

01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm just struggling to to figure out
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
what new information would possibly come
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
out of the study committee that we
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
haven't heard and last and at least my
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
three terms on ways and means
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
around this conversation and adjusting
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
the formula specifically
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
um i know i struggle with the concept of
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
i'll get to my question mr chair i just
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
want to stage i i struggled the question
 
01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.910 align:start position:0%
want to stage i i struggled the question
of

01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
of allotting more to a given town
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
because it raised it when in fact i'll
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
use my town as an example we have 93
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
running through us my ambulance goes on
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
93 on a regular basis to deal with
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
people who are heading north because
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
they get in a car accident
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
or they hit they hit something and so my
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
town's first responders have to go out
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
and deal with that on a regular basis
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
even though we have absolutely no
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
revenue coming in but we have a we have
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
an absolute expense
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
send bills to them so my struggle is my
 
01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
struggle is understanding why we won't
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
treat all towns equally instead try to
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
manipulate the bill and what is the
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
overriding factor that needs a study
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
committee that's going to change
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
i think that rims does provide a
 
01:09:54.719 --> 01:09:56.070 align:start position:0%
i think that rims does provide a
possibility

01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.189 align:start position:0%
possibility
of

01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:09:57.199 --> 01:09:58.550 align:start position:0%
of
maintaining

01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
maintaining
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
privacy to specific businesses but
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
making it possible to know
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
how much each town
 
01:10:07.199 --> 01:10:08.550 align:start position:0%
how much each town
and

01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
the locations of where revenue is coming
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
from i think there could be a difference
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
between the percentage that goes back
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
to the population between rooms and
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
meals and that is very specifically why
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
i signed on to this bill i think we
 
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
should know whether that's
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
possible people in the north country
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
generally tend to think that they ought
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
that rooms
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
more rooms money should come back
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
than meals
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
i think it's worth studying i think that
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
rims gives us an opportunity to find
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
more information
 
01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.750 align:start position:0%
more information
about

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
what our business and tourist
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
business particularly
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
generates in the way of revenue for
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it's a growing industry
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
and we know from the pandemic that
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
downs are been heavily affected
 
01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.470 align:start position:0%
downs are been heavily affected
by

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and the number of people
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
who are coming to their communities
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
gorham feels like it was overwhelmed in
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
2020 almost
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
and it caused a lot of difficulties so i
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
specifically did hear senator hennessey
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
when she appeared before the gorham
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
selectmen you know as a sort of routine
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
i'm a senator do you have concerns
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
and very specifically the town manager
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
and the selectmen mentioned the concern
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
of rooms and meals so it isn't just sort
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
of any constituent or business this is a
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
town that felt beleaguered and as though
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.669 align:start position:0%
the state
could

01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
have the possibility of helping more in
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
the distribution formula
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
and asked her to sponsor such bill
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh robert and elmi
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm not going to give my
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
speech about the
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
problems of urban hubs that have hotels
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
and take care of the services for
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
everybody around them for free
 
01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.270 align:start position:0%
everybody around them for free
but

01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
on i did want to be able to to ask
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
before we finish whether rims is
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to have the d.r.a okay
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
you have a question for representative
 
01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.990 align:start position:0%
you have a question for representative
tucker

01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
tucker
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
no just uh sympathy
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
well i do have a very specific other
 
01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.270 align:start position:0%
well i do have a very specific other
myself

01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
one of my constituent towns is carroll
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
and carroll is made up of twin mountain
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
and bretton woods
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
bratton woods
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
has the omni mount washington hotel and
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
they have just tremendous rooms and
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
meals revenue
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
carol only has 723
 
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.510 align:start position:0%
carol only has 723
people

01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.470 align:start position:0%
people
so

01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
their distribution for all of the work
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
that they do
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
in hosting those uh
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
visitors and on summer weekends it can
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
be up to 10 000 people
 
01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.790 align:start position:0%
be up to 10 000 people
so

01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
they get very little money with only a
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
723 or 25 or 50
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
residents that's the multiplier
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
and it seems grossly unfair to those
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
towns that are very very small
 
01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.229 align:start position:0%
towns that are very very small
that

01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
their revenue is
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
based on their population their small
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
populations with very
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
specific and large expenses to be the
 
01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.669 align:start position:0%
specific and large expenses to be the
host

01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
host
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative eugene
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
question um i can understand what you're
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
talking about with the distribution
 
01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.790 align:start position:0%
talking about with the distribution
however

01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
even though these towns may be small the
 
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
fact that they have
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
this uh commerce going on is benefiting
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
residents who who work there so i would
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
think there's employment opportunities
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
if there's 10 000 people showing up uh
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
in that area on a weekend aren't they
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
spending money in the area helping small
 
01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.790 align:start position:0%
spending money in the area helping small
businesses

01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
so that you're getting benefit in those
 
01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.390 align:start position:0%
so that you're getting benefit in those
ways

01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
ways
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
aren't you that's right but it doesn't
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
generate revenue
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
for the municipality that's the
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
difference it generates
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
good things for the businesses and we're
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
all for that
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
but specifically
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
a municipality
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
has to provide services
 
01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:34.870 align:start position:0%
has to provide services
for

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
these people and they aren't getting any
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
revenue directly from it and they don't
 
01:14:40.239 --> 01:14:41.110 align:start position:0%
revenue directly from it and they don't
get

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know there isn't any direct
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
business tax that comes to the
 
01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.470 align:start position:0%
business tax that comes to the
mississippi

01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
mississippi
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
so that's that's where the gap is and
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
that i think is worth studying
 
01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.350 align:start position:0%
that i think is worth studying
because

01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
i think the north country more and more
 
01:14:58.630 --> 01:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
we we have declining population
 
01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.350 align:start position:0%
we we have declining population
so

01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
we have a declining population and the
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
revenue source that we help the state
 
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.590 align:start position:0%
revenue source that we help the state
generate

01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
generate
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
only comes back on the basis
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
of the population of the towns that are
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
generating that revenue and that i think
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
is worth studying
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative romney yeah thank you i
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
was going to wait for the work session
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
to have this conversation but real quick
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
but i wouldn't want to be paying the
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
property tax bill of the omni hotel
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
mount washington hotel or the or
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
brentwood ski area
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they're huge
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
so the town is getting revenue for the
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
fact that those businesses are there
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
because if they weren't there they
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be getting that kind of revenue
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
so bratton woods is and carol are very
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
lucky of course
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
but they still feel beleaguered by the
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
very specific costs that they have
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
i will
 
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
i have of course next to my desk at home
 
01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:53.350 align:start position:0%
i have of course next to my desk at home
the

01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
town reports and i will come up with if
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
we have a work session i'll bring
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
bring information specifically based on
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
a forum which i do not represent and
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
carol i think that those two towns are
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
interesting that'll be interesting to
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
see what kind of property tax they're
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
paying thank you happy to do that
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
saying none i'd like to have the dra
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
mr chair members of the committee
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
carolyn lear i'm the assistant
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the department of
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
revenue happy to answer your questions
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
right the first thing is
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.350 align:start position:0%
 
when

01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.590 align:start position:0%
when
a

01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
say a hotel owner
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
files his bill
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
would you be able to determine
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
if he has six hotels or six motels or
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that's spread out over
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
the whole state we'd be able to
 
01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.149 align:start position:0%
the whole state we'd be able to
determine

01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
determine
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
which one
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
is associated with each
 
01:17:07.679 --> 01:17:10.229 align:start position:0%
is associated with each
town

01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.239 --> 01:17:10.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.229 align:start position:0%
so
currently

01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
the rims system is not built to require
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
an operator to schedule out their
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
revenue in that fashion
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
that because that information isn't
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
currently necessary
 
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
for purposes of calculating the tax or
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
the distribution as it exists in law
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
the system could certainly be
 
01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.350 align:start position:0%
the system could certainly be
modified

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
modified
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
to collect that information
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
and that would not be a heavy lift
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
on our end
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
but as you know
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
from the legislative history of this
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
issue there's been several bills to
 
01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:54.950 align:start position:0%
issue there's been several bills to
require

01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
reporting m r revenue on that fashion
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
and those bills have all
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
failed to date um so we've not
 
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
proactively taken the step which i think
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
would be counter to your intent thus far
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
to require reporting in that fashion
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative romney followed by
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
elneny but we've had these i think
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
we've had these discussions in the past
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know usually revolves more around
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
the restaurants when it came to
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
prorating out
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know the dunkin donut guide
 
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
around 50 stores
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh and they want it that way it was it
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
was it was the legislation that passed
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
that fact that we have consolidated
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
under what you term would be
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
consolidated reporting
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
of all the stores and i'm sure there are
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
folks that own multiple hotels as well
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
it could be a chain
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
marriotts or whatever they may and i
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
don't know if they do or not but they
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
may report if they're owned by the same
 
01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
probably franchise but
 
01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.590 align:start position:0%
probably franchise but
but

01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
they report so if we were to undo that
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
that would be because we did that for
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
convenience for them in terms of filing
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
their taxes
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
so would that create a burden
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
for those businesses that have to now
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
report out separately
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
all of the where the revenue comes from
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that that has been the crux
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the debate in the past on the issue
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
um i can't speak personally to the
 
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.070 align:start position:0%
um i can't speak personally to the
burden

01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
burden
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
on those businesses but i think i'm just
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
looking at my list i think we've
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
considered about five bills in the past
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know seven or so years that would
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
have required
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
scheduling out and certainly
 
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
i recall that the businesses testified
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative elmi
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
carolyn if on this bill for the first
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
time only asks for
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
the hotels
 
01:19:56.159 --> 01:19:57.110 align:start position:0%
the hotels
and

01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
it seems likely that anybody that owned
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
multiple hotels would also have quite a
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
bit of administrative competence
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
to provide you the breakdown
 
01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.750 align:start position:0%
to provide you the breakdown
on

01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know what they're going to have
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
to say about this but uh
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that make it a lot easier and
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
if if it was easier on them would it
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
also on
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
how much difficulty would you have
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
putting it into the system if we changed
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
for hotels
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
from a system perspective i don't
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
believe that it would be technically
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
difficult it would make the form longer
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
because presumably there would need to
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
be more lines so that each operator
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
could schedule out each of their
 
01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.709 align:start position:0%
could schedule out each of their
locations

01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
locations
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
i suspect there would be a small cost to
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
make those changes but i don't think
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
it's substantial enough for it to impact
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
your decision making
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
it would probably be in the tens of
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars not the hundreds of
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to program that
 
01:21:07.679 --> 01:21:10.229 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to program that
change

01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to testify
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
saying none
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
i'll close the public hearing on senate
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
this is representative tucker's card
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
doubles from the less belt oh tucker
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
but you want to give it to uh yeah there
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:21.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.199 --> 01:23:47.189 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.199 --> 01:24:15.030 align:start position:0%
 
hey

01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:23.990 align:start position:0%

yes

01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
hey i'm going to open a public hearing
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 435-fn
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
an act relative to the net operating
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
loss carryover under the business
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
profits tax
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
representation senator geiger is the
 
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor senator geider is here to
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
committee for the record bob guida
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
senator from district 2
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719 align:start position:0%
so senate bill 435
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
addresses a problem that new hampshire
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
exclusively had it was the only state
 
01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.910 align:start position:0%
exclusively had it was the only state
that

01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.510 align:start position:0%
that
essentially

01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
double apportioned taxation
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
on the net operating loss carryover am i
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
on the right bill
 
01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i am yeah yeah sorry too many bills
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
not enough time
 
01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:31.910 align:start position:0%
not enough time
um

01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
and so in the interests of
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
both rationalizing our taxation system
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
to the irs code uh
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
most current 2018 i believe and
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
remedying this
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
exclusivity which is actually detriment
 
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
to business environment
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
we brought forth senate bill 435
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
and that's what it does basically it
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
stops the double apportionment
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
function or function of
 
01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:59.030 align:start position:0%
function or function of
uh

01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
of the net operating loss carryover
 
01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.470 align:start position:0%
of the net operating loss carryover
application

01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
application
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony senator
 
01:27:09.510 --> 01:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
greiter questions representative me
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm going to keep asking this
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
question until someone explains it well
 
01:27:13.679 --> 01:27:14.870 align:start position:0%
question until someone explains it well
on

01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
can you explain the process of double
 
01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.189 align:start position:0%
can you explain the process of double
apportionment

01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
no the dra can
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna have to wait for them to
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
know what we're talking about
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
most people haven't dealt with it yet
 
01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:34.550 align:start position:0%
most people haven't dealt with it yet
here

01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
yeah we had the same question in the
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
senate and so i'll defer to their
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
expertise at the risk of saying
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
something inappropriate not
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
inappropriate but incorrect
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
so that's where i go with that thank you
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative lange
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and if i'm not mistaken
 
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
besides the double apportionment issue
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
it deals with updating the irs code to
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
the most current code that is currently
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
we specify a specific year is that
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
correct right thank you
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:28:05.110 --> 01:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representative schamberg
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
for taking this question uh
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
this is a detriment to the business
 
01:28:13.679 --> 01:28:18.550 align:start position:0%
this is a detriment to the business
environment

01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
i've heard from ways and means members
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
in here that
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
when we reduce the bpt by one-tenth of
 
01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:30.639 align:start position:0%
one percent to 7.5
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
my correct representativeness yes
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
that businesses would
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
flock here
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
because of the reduction
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
is this a counter i mean i i'm confused
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit uh
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
are they coming or not coming are they
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
staying are they leaving because of this
 
01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.390 align:start position:0%
staying are they leaving because of this
uh

01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.910 align:start position:0%
of this
nold

01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
nold
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
i would submit that businesses are not
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
coming but it's not because of our tax
 
01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.149 align:start position:0%
coming but it's not because of our tax
structure

01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
okay they're not coming because we don't
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
have a labor pool we don't have
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
workforce housing and those are issues
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
that are being addressed in other
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
legislation from other committees both
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
in the senate and the house
 
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
but when you are the only state out of
 
01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.229 align:start position:0%
but when you are the only state out of
50

01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
50
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
that does the double apportionment of
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
that sets you apart from the rest of the
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
country and that is
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
against our favor as being as a business
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
environment okay so
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh to answer your question
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
businesses are trying to come here but
 
01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
they're turning away for other reasons
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
that our tax structure which we hope to
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
improve yet again this uh this term yeah
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.709 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you senator gaida
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
aren't we also
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
by far
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
the most dependent
 
01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:47.990 align:start position:0%
the most dependent
tax

01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.510 align:start position:0%
tax
state

01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
on the business taxes
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
for our budgets
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
we are very dependent on business taxes
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
which is why it makes a great deal of
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
sense to be business friendly and reduce
 
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
those taxes to watch the revenues
 
01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:03.030 align:start position:0%
those taxes to watch the revenues
increase

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
right we're a 240 million dollar surplus
 
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
right now and who knows april hasn't
 
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
rolled in yet
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
again whatever we can do to help
 
01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.790 align:start position:0%
again whatever we can do to help
businesses

01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.070 align:start position:0%
businesses
ultimately

01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
helps those that don't have jobs because
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
businesses like to create jobs they like
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
to grow markets like to expand their
 
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
product lines and do those things so
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to better that
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
environment which is already
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
very good in new england and amongst the
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
best in the united states will continue
 
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
to attract the businesses that will
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
provide employment and help take people
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
off welfare roles and give them homes
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
and things like that
 
01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:40.470 align:start position:0%
and things like that
follow-up

01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:41.669 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we try to attract our
 
01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:47.350 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we try to attract our
workforce

01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
more than
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
businesses at this point so that the
 
01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
businesses we've got aren't suffering
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
and the property tax is one of the main
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
reasons that the housing
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
market is really difficult i would i
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
would challenge the question that
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
property taxes are the
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
prime source of difficulty lack of
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
inventory there's nothing for sale the
 
01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:11.030 align:start position:0%
inventory there's nothing for sale the
state

01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
that's the reason rents are so high and
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
prices of houses are out through the
 
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:14.950 align:start position:0%
prices of houses are out through the
roof

01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
roof
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
and again the more houses we can build
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
as we restrict
 
01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:19.910 align:start position:0%
as we restrict
uh

01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
or as we release reduce the restrictions
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
against housing either locally or
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
statewide i think we'll be better off
 
01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's not driven by the property
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%

so i know it's hard to pronounce or
 
01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.030 align:start position:0%
so i know it's hard to pronounce or
euselio

01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
euselio
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
so good morning everyone my name is
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
jimmy salio i am a cpa
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
and tax practitioner and i'm here to
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
represent the greater nashua chamber of
 
01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:12.709 align:start position:0%
represent the greater nashua chamber of
commerce

01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
i'm here to um i should also say that i
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
was a member of the commission to study
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire business taxes back in
 
01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.790 align:start position:0%
new hampshire business taxes back in
2014

01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
2014
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
and one of the recommendations of that
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
report of that commission was to fix
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
this double apportionment issue for the
 
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
nols and so i'm glad to see that that's
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
being addressed here
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
um and so the chamber fully supports
 
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
that effects of the double
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
pushment of the nol
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
excuse me so i'm not here to talk about
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
that what i wanted to kind of just
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
highlight this morning is the change to
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
the internal revenue code reference and
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'm really specifically
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
talking about smaller businesses
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
so the apportionment fix is really in my
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
mind geared toward the larger businesses
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
that do business in and out of the state
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire so whether it's a
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
domestic company or foreign company if
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
it does business in and out and it
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
has sufficient nexus in other states
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
they have to apportion their income and
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
so this fixes that and gets the answer
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
to the right answer that it should be
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
but excuse me for the smaller businesses
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
that don't apportion their income that's
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
really what i wanted to speak about
 
01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:20.950 align:start position:0%
really what i wanted to speak about
because

01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
this bill again the apportionment issue
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
for the businesses in new hampshire like
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
a main street
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
landscapers restaurants bars that don't
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
apportion their income this appointment
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
fix has no bearing on them but what this
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
bill will do as passed will impose a new
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
80 limitation on the use of nols and so
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure that you've thought
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
that through
 
01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:44.550 align:start position:0%
that through
um

01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
so just for some background here
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
the tax cuts and jobs act from 2017
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
changed the federal annual rules and so
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
before the tax cuts and jobs act there
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
was no 80 percent cap in nols you you
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
could just use your federal nol
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
there was also a two-year carry-back in
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
the 20-year carry forward period and so
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
many of the provisions of the tax cuts
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
and jobs act were very favorable such as
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
the decrease in tax rates and so forth
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things that the
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
federal law did to help i guess raise
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
revenue a bit to offset all those tax
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
cuts was to implement an 80 limitation
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
on the use of nols
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
and so that i would say is unfavorable
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
but what it did i guess to soften the
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
blow was it changed the carry forward
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
period from 20 years forward to
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
indefinite and so i think in the fair
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
that because the federal or the code now
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
has this 80 limitation businesses may i
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
guess conceptually may not be able to
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
use all their nos because they could go
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
expired if there's a cap now
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
and so under the internal revenue code
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
as of 18 the carry forward period is
 
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.830 align:start position:0%
as of 18 the carry forward period is
unlimited

01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
unlimited
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire of what this bill does
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
it now
 
01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
follows the internal revenue code as of
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
2018 because it defaults to the bbt code
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
so again it could change in the future
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
if we adopt a different code in the
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
future to to to tie to
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't change the carry forward
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
period right we have a 10-year carry
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
forward period so under federal law now
 
01:35:19.109 --> 01:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
they have this 80 cap
 
01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
and an unlimited carry forward period
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
we're picking the worst of both we're
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
now imposing this 80 cap and we still
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
have a 10-year carry forward period
 
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
and so just to kind of give you two
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
examples to highlight this
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
conceptually if a business makes a
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand i'm sorry if a business
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
loses a hundred thousand dollars in year
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
one in year two it makes a hundred
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
over that two year period it's made
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
nothing right it's broken even and so
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
you would expect that company to pay no
 
01:35:48.159 --> 01:35:49.430 align:start position:0%
you would expect that company to pay no
taxes

01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
mechanically how that works is a company
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
if it lost a hundred thousand dollars in
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
year one it would file a tax return with
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
that one hundred thousand dollar net
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
operating loss which gets carried
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
forward to the subsequent year in year
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
two they're going to file a tax return a
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a profit
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
they then can deduct that hundred
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar carryover from the prior
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
year and they come to zero income no tax
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
so it makes sense
 
01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:15.679 align:start position:0%
but what this bill would do and it's
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
effective in 2022 would say
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
that company that lost a hundred
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars files tax return has it
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
and i will carry forward over a hundred
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars but in year two when it
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
makes a hundred thousand dollars we're
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
going to make you pay tax because we're
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
only going to allow you to deduct up to
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
eighty percent of your taxable income
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
and so we're going to create twenty
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of taxable income
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
and you're going to pay a tax and then
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
you can carry that nol that rest of that
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
now that we disallowed to the next year
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
and you can only do that for 10 years
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
and so put it in more real terms if you
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
think through what's happened recently
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
against especially for smaller
 
01:36:53.679 --> 01:36:54.790 align:start position:0%
against especially for smaller
businesses

01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic if a small
 
01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:57.830 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic if a small
business

01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
lost money over the last few years and
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
you can kind of pick a number but say a
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
lot it lost three hundred thousand
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
dollars over the last two or three years
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
and then in 2022 it starts to turn the
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
corner and it makes a hundred thousand
 
01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:10.870 align:start position:0%
corner and it makes a hundred thousand
dollars

01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
you would think that that company
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to pay taxes because it
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
just lost three hundred thousand dollars
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
it survived the pandemic
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
it turns the corner makes a hundred
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in 2022 but this law
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
would say you know what you can only
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
deduct up to eighty percent of that loss
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
that you are carrying forward and so
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to have twenty thousand
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
dollars in 2022 a taxable income and
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have to pay the tax and you
 
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
can carry forward that other the rest of
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
the nol
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
and it just gets worse if you then think
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
about what happens next year
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
next year the companies turned the
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
corner it makes another hundred thousand
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
dollars in 2023. they get the exact same
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
answer they're still going to have to
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
pay a tax next year because this 80
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
limitation that that's going to be every
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
year they have this and so they start
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
out with a 300 000 loss for the last few
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
years survive the pandemic make some
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
money in 2022 but can only deduct up to
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
80 percent of the income and so my
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
example they'd come out of 2022 with a
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
220 000 nol carry forward to 2023 they
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
make some another hundred thousand
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
dollars but they can only deduct up to
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
80 percent of the income in 2023 and
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
they're gonna have to pay a tax and then
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
before you know it the ten year goes
 
01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:22.390 align:start position:0%
before you know it the ten year goes
away

01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
and they might lose some of their
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
annuals because of this 80 limitation
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
and so again
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
my perspective is the fixed the double
 
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
apportionment is a great thing
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
but for the smaller businesses that
 
01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
don't apportion their income that has no
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
bearing on anything it doesn't matter to
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
them the only thing that's going to
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
affect them is this 80 limitation and so
 
01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
what you could do is what you've done in
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
other situations where you adopt the
 
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
internal revenue code which is decoupled
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
from that provision i mean we do it all
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
the time we we adopt the code every few
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
years the department puts out what
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
changes that has on the bbt and then we
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
disallow say bonus depreciation and so
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
you could certainly decouple from this
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
80 percent limitation if that's what you
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
again because if you don't
 
01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:09.270 align:start position:0%
again because if you don't
again

01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
although we're fixing the double
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
apportionment issue we still have a
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
10-year carry forward period and a 10
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
million dollar cap which i understand
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
there's budget issues that you know you
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
may have to live with that but then to
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
throw on to that an 80 limitation it's
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
just not it's not as good as what it
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
could be and so i want to make sure that
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
you think that through for the new
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses that don't
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
apportion their income
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
so hopefully i was clear and can answer
 
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
very helpful thank you questions from
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative elmi
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
followed by representative i had a
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
couple the first one is quite specific
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
on don't aren't we already decoupled
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
from that provision so this bill would
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
be reversing that
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
well we had we're going to adopt the
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
section 172 of the code in effect as of
 
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
12 31 18
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
and so that's what we're going to follow
 
01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
what what what our what our
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
77-848 says is
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
we specifically have a 10-year carry
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
fold in a 10-year cap and so in that
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
regard we decouple but not with regards
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
to the 80 limitation
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
yes but what i'm saying is we don't need
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
to decouple from
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
from that we already are decoupled
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
no not with respect to the 80
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
limitation the cap
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
right now we don't we don't have that
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
cap because we follow the code as in
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
1996. so that's this 80 limitation
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist today it exists if this
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
bill passes yes that's what i'm saying
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay we just need to kill that part of
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
the bill in order
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
to keep decoupled
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
right you could kill that part of the
 
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:00.790 align:start position:0%
right you could kill that part of the
bill

01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
if you don't want the 80 just like you
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
have a 10-year carry forward and a 10
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
million cap you could come up with
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
language to get rid of the 80
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
taxable income if that's what you choose
 
01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:13.030 align:start position:0%
taxable income if that's what you choose
okay

01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:13.830 align:start position:0%
okay
and

01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
could could i have
 
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
well it's it's not really a follow-up
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
it's a second question
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
if he could explain
 
01:41:25.350 --> 01:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
double apportionment as it is practiced
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
in in new hampshire over a period of
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
years say you've got that
 
01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:31.030 align:start position:0%
years say you've got that
uh

01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
you've got a business
 
01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:34.229 align:start position:0%
you've got a business
that

01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
that on
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
was apportioned three years ago
 
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
on at
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
34 of its business
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
and then the next year at
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
28 of its business and
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
and so forth how would that affect
 
01:41:54.239 --> 01:41:55.669 align:start position:0%
and so forth how would that affect
uh

01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
affect this bill
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
right so again i look at this bill as
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
two components we have this 80 issue but
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
it's kind of it's buried in this code
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
okay the apportionment issue
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
so right so this issue has existed as
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
long as i can remember
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
and it's just the way
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
it's because of how the statute is
 
01:42:14.239 --> 01:42:15.430 align:start position:0%
it's because of how the statute is
crafted

01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
crafted
 
01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:16.870 align:start position:0%
crafted
so

01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
most states you can either you can
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
handle an nol at a state level different
 
01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:22.950 align:start position:0%
handle an nol at a state level different
ways

01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
ways
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
some states make you apportion the loss
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
in the year incurred
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
and then you apply that
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
a portion loss to your um
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
post-apportioned income and so it's
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
apples and apples you apportion your
 
01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:36.390 align:start position:0%
apples and apples you apportion your
loss

01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
loss
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
wherever state you're in 50
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
and then that apportion loss gets
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
carried forward and it is applied to
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
your portioned income in the subsequent
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
year so it's apples and apples
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
the way in some states have a
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
pre-apportion they'll take your no l
 
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
they won't have you apportion it they'll
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
let you carry over to another year and
 
01:42:57.030 --> 01:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
it comes in pre-apportionment so again
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's apples and apples you can either do
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
it kind of pre-apportion or post a
 
01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:01.430 align:start position:0%
it kind of pre-apportion or post a
portion

01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
portion
 
01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.390 align:start position:0%
portion
we

01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
do we do it in either way what we say is
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
we make you apportion your loss in the
 
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
year you occur the loss carry that
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
forward but because of the way the
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
statutes written you start out with your
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
business prop your gross business
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
profits and then you layer in your 77 84
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
adjustments to arrive at taxable income
 
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
which then gets apportioned
 
01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
the nol is a 70 74 adjustment so you
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
start out with gross business profits
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
you then bring in your post portion loss
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
in arriving at taxable income that gets
 
01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:35.350 align:start position:0%
in arriving at taxable income that gets
apportioned

01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
apportioned
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
and so it's because it's an a4
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
adjustment and it just happens to be how
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
it's how we craft our statute you always
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
start with gross business profits you
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
add your a4 adjustments to arrive at
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
taxable profits then you apportion it
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
and so because we say that that loss
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
gets a portion in the year that's
 
01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:53.189 align:start position:0%
gets a portion in the year that's
incurred

01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
incurred
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
you start out with kind of a
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
post-portion loss but then you have to
 
01:43:59.590 --> 01:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
layer it into
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
you add it to your business profits to
 
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
arrive at taxable profits
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
that then gets a portion so it's because
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
this is this
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's because it's an a4 adjustment
 
01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:11.510 align:start position:0%
it's because it's an a4 adjustment
effectively

01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative rodney
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for your
 
01:44:15.199 --> 01:44:16.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for your
testimony

01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
i just want to go back to the
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh the 80 cap and the 10 year carry
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
forward so
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
current currently without doing anything
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
because we don't conform to the 2018
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
code correct right so
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
so right now
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
what is it again i want to make sure i
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
understand is it is it the worst of all
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
world or is it is it
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
do we have the do we have a cap
 
01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:41.430 align:start position:0%
do we have the do we have a cap
now

01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
we have a we have the 10-year carry
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
forward and a 10 million dollar cap of
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
an nol in a given year so so 10 million
 
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
right cap
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
in any given year and then a 10 year
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
carry forward right so again so i know
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
in the commission we suggested that if
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
feasible you know you may want to change
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
that to make the state more competitive
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
with other states
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
but again i realize it's a big revenue
 
01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:06.310 align:start position:0%
but again i realize it's a big revenue
issue

01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
but but it exists okay but if if we
 
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
follow go ahead if we follow if we do
 
01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:14.709 align:start position:0%
follow go ahead if we follow if we do
conform

01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
conform
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
as the irs
 
01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:17.669 align:start position:0%
as the irs
languages

01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
languages
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
then it would be an 80 cap
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
and no
 
01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
no limitation on the carry forward years
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
is that what we're looking at no if you
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
if you adopted 18 code
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
yeah normally there would be an 80 cap
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
like there now is under federal law
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
right federal law also to help i think
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers because of the
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
80 cap that they were forcing on people
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
said you can carry forward unlimited
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
years it used to be 20 years carried
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
forward they say unlimited
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
but new hampshire
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
explicitly says right in the statute
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
that the losses can only be carried
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
forward for 10 years and so i don't see
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
that changing that's what it says and
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
the bill and the bill and in the current
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
statute okay yep
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
but if we adopted if we had if you
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
adopted it i think the only irs it would
 
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
be unlimited no i think it would be 10
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
years as it says it would oh right in
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
so we have to adjust the bill to if we
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
want to totally conform to the feds what
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
yeah if you wanted to
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
have an 80 cap
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
and you wanted to
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
conform to the fed i guess you could
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
have an unlimited carry forward period
 
01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:26.950 align:start position:0%
have an unlimited carry forward period
right

01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
versus keeping the 10 years and just
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the 80
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
just like it is today i mean that's what
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
the law is today there's no cap and it's
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
a 10-year carry forward provision okay
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
represent indonesia
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so just to
 
01:46:51.679 --> 01:46:52.790 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so just to
understand

01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
if we had if we keep a 10-year cap let's
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
say you have a business that has a huge
 
01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:58.629 align:start position:0%
say you have a business that has a huge
loss

01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
loss
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
in the first year
 
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
such that
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
over 10 years they still haven't
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
completely made up that loss
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
if we
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
stay with the 10-year cap then then in
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
that case that business wouldn't be able
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
to recoup that so
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
right i don't know how often that occurs
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
is do you have a sense of whether that's
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
a yeah i don't know maybe the department
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
can answer that my sense is it doesn't
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
have it would have to probably be a
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
larger company that um
 
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know the loss was large enough um
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
and their profit over the next 10 years
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
was not enough to absorb that loss
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you but again having the the cap
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
is just now going to exacerbate that
 
01:47:36.639 --> 01:47:37.669 align:start position:0%
is just now going to exacerbate that
because

01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
again if you do my example um
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
they can't use those nls like we can
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
today every year it's going to be
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
limited to 80 of their income so
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
so it may increase
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
the losses okay
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
just before we go further
 
01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
with this with this bill as is
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
would it be a disadvantage to the small
 
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
companies more than to the large
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
companies or would it be
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
would there be any advantage
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
well i would answer it this way the
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
the small companies i would say
 
01:48:14.719 --> 01:48:16.790 align:start position:0%
the small companies i would say
generally

01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:48:18.629 --> 01:48:18.639 align:start position:0%
don't a portion of income i was i would
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
think a lot by and large because they
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
just do business in new hampshire the
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
small businesses they just if you just
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
do business in new hampshire and you
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
don't apportion
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
there's only one thing that comes out of
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
this bill it's a bad answer they have
 
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
this 80 cap if you if you're large
 
01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
and you will portion your income this is
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
a this is a good bill because it fixes
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
the double apportionment issue which is
 
01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
key to them and so if you're a large
 
01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:42.870 align:start position:0%
key to them and so if you're a large
business

01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay the 80 cap isn't great but at least
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
we got rid of the double apportionment
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
issue so that's that's good for the
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
large larger businesses but if you have
 
01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
a small business on main street that
 
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't apportion
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
this apportionment issue is a non-factor
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
the only
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
the only effect is the 80 cap
 
01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:04.149 align:start position:0%
the only effect is the 80 cap
okay

01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative scheinberg
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question jim
 
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
over here
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry okay
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh i would like to know mr chairman
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
could the gentleman
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
provide since we don't have a white
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
board here could he provide on paper
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
just a
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
a a demonstration of these
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
blocks of how
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
what you talked about was just
 
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
so smooth
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
you didn't get stuck anywhere but some
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
of our minds are stuck right now
 
01:49:37.589 --> 01:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
i just
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
could you provide us
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
an example
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
you know a drawing of something for the
 
01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
future maybe what i can do is have
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
another speaker come up and i can just
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
die no no no you you could put put it
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
together and send it to us oh okay i can
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
thank you that'd be great okay
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative elmi
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um there was one glitch in
 
01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
your explanation
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
on given
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
that most of our people haven't had to
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
deal with this before and i don't even
 
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
remember this
 
01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:09.350 align:start position:0%
remember this
on

01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
the a4 adjustments what are they
 
01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:14.660 align:start position:0%
the a4 adjustments what are they
so

01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:14.670 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:14.670 --> 01:50:16.629 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
so the formula for new hampshire's
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
taxable business profits is you start
 
01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
out with gross business profits which is
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
generally federal taxable income
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
so that's your starting point
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
these are all defined terms in the
 
01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:31.109 align:start position:0%
these are all defined terms in the
statute

01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
so you start out generally with federal
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
taxable income and then we have specific
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
adjustments under 77 a4 like a separate
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
entity adjustment like our compensation
 
01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:42.550 align:start position:0%
entity adjustment like our compensation
deduction

01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
deduction
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
to arrive at new hampshire taxable
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
profits so you start with gross business
 
01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
profits you have these a4 adjustments to
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
arrive at taxable business profits which
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
then gets apportioned
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
in arriving at new hampshire portion
 
01:50:57.910 --> 01:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
taxable income
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
and so we have i can't recall
 
01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
how many for adjustments there are but
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
there may be a dozen or so and one of
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:19.270 --> 01:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
it's the business tax section
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
of the business profits tax
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
and it's on something a4
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
is where we look for the list
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
right it's specifically 77 a4
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome thank you and
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%

01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
i've been asked

pink cards and they want to come up
 
01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:57.910 align:start position:0%
pink cards and they want to come up

01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
i won't go into our company background
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
since mr berkey did a good job of that
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
except to say that we are also in
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
addition to our ownership of seabrook
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
a the largest renewable energy generator
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
in in the world from wind and sun and a
 
01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:44.310 align:start position:0%
in in the world from wind and sun and a
world

01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
world
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
leader in battery storage
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
my name is angela pitali as has been
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
said i am a tax professional
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
my whole career has been as a tax
 
01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
professional and i now focus just on
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
state tax policy
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
and the reason we're here today is
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire is a
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
an outlier
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
from every other state in their
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
treatment of
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
not operating losses
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
sb 435 would help to remedy that
 
01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:13.030 align:start position:0%
sb 435 would help to remedy that
situation

01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
from a policy perspective not operating
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
losses are intended to even out the
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
differences between
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
business cycles which don't fit in to a
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
tax year and
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
necessary but arbitrarily created tax
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
years so you have business cycles you
 
01:54:33.189 --> 01:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
have startup companies that generate
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
losses over periods of time
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
and these cycles don't fit into a tax
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
year but you have to have a tax year in
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
order to file your tax returns
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of noels is to even out
 
01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
the federal law and other states limit
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
that policy goal by imposing things such
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
as the 80 percent limitation that has
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
been discussed
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
but no other state in the nation
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
imposes the double apportionment that
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
doing so in some cases renders net
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
operating loss is virtually worthless
 
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
especially when coupled with the other
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
limitations that have already been
 
01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:16.950 align:start position:0%
limitations that have already been
discussed

01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
and this subverts the worthy policy goal
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
of net operating losses and evening out
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
those business cycles for taxpayers and
 
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
it makes new hampshire uncompetitive
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
compared to other states in that regard
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
and with that i am happy to take any
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the members
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
yes how frequently does seabrook
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
representative almi
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
that's a complicated question because we
 
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
are a very large
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
complicated company
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
seabrook does not file a tax return in
 
01:56:05.669 --> 01:56:05.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in a vacuum it files
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
as part of a larger
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
consolidated group
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
so seabrook is just one piece of our tax
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
return filing that we file in new
 
01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:21.830 align:start position:0%
return filing that we file in new
hampshire

01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
further question okay representative
 
01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
romney oh
 
01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
isn't seabrook owned by multiple
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
companies yes we're a majority of them
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
approximately ninety percent nine
 
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
percent thank you
 
01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.550 align:start position:0%
percent thank you
representative

01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:56:45.189 --> 01:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so you said that
 
01:56:47.109 --> 01:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is an outlier in terms of
 
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
how we handle
 
01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
net operating loss the uh the 10-year
 
01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:52.229 align:start position:0%
net operating loss the uh the 10-year
provision

01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:56:54.149 --> 01:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
that's still in this bill does that
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
still make it an outlier even if we
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
adopted this bill
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
yes 10 years is very short compared to
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
most other states many states have a
 
01:57:08.229 --> 01:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
20-year carry forward period consistent
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
with the prior federal law and many
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
states have now
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
conformed to the federal law and have an
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
unlimited carry forward period thank you
 
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative almighty did you have
 
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
so how does that work so again federal
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
law is 80 percent on an unlimited i'm
 
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't hear that federal law
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
right now is what 80 and unlimited
 
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
yes federal law allows you to carry over
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
your net operating loss and in the
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
future year when you have income you can
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
offset eighty percent of that taxable
 
01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
income in that particular year and
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
continue to carry forward the rest of it
 
01:57:56.639 --> 01:57:57.990 align:start position:0%
continue to carry forward the rest of it
forever

01:57:57.990 --> 01:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
forever
 
01:57:59.070 --> 01:57:59.080 align:start position:0%
right and i
 
01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
understand and i i think i understand
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
this because if you take 80 and you keep
 
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
on going 80 you never get to the total
 
01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
amount correct well it's not 80 of the
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
loss it's 80 percent of the taxable
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
income that you generate in that future
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
year so if i have a hundred thousand
 
01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:15.910 align:start position:0%
year so if i have a hundred thousand
dollars

01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:16.870 align:start position:0%
dollars
of

01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
of an annual carry forward as as the
 
01:58:22.229 --> 01:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the cpa society i'll use
 
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
his example if i have a hundred thousand
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
dollar loss in year one and i carry that
 
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
forward and i have a one hundred
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar taxable income
 
01:58:34.709 --> 01:58:34.719 align:start position:0%
before anna wells in the next period
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
i can deduct
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
up to 80 percent of that taxable income
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
number so i can deduct 80 000
 
01:58:45.189 --> 01:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
in that year the next year if i have a
 
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars of income i can
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
deduct the rest of it which is the
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars so it's it's not
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
the loss that you keep multiplying down
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
to never get to zero
 
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
income in the future that actually
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
further questions represent almighty
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
sorry i remembered what i wanted to ask
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
next which is
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
assuming that we're talking about the
 
01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:11.589 align:start position:0%
assuming that we're talking about the
entire

01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
entire
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
energy uh next year energy resources
 
01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:17.750 align:start position:0%
energy uh next year energy resources
conglomerate

01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
conglomerate
 
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
that files
 
01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:20.310 align:start position:0%
that files
on

01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
how often do you
 
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:30.149 --> 01:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not i can't accurately answer that
 
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
question i i don't do our tax compliance
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
work so i i'm actually not sure of the
 
01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
answer to that question
 
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
i apologize could i ask in a slight well
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
a slightly different question about the
 
01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:47.750 align:start position:0%
which is
on

01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
if a company
 
01:59:51.990 --> 01:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
was large enough
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
that it had a
 
01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:56.229 align:start position:0%
that it had a
or

01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
a net operating loss
 
01:59:58.800 --> 02:00:00.950 align:start position:0%
a net operating loss
uh

02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
of over a million a year which i think
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
is our part of our cap
 
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:07.030 align:start position:0%
is our part of our cap
on

02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:07.990 align:start position:0%
on
and

02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.030 align:start position:0%
and
but

02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:09.990 align:start position:0%
but
on

02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
could not use
 
02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
the credit
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
of the nol to get
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
further to get back
 
02:00:20.639 --> 02:00:22.550 align:start position:0%
further to get back
to

02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:23.990 align:start position:0%
to
solvency

02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
solvency
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
over a 10-year period would that company
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
well that would be very company specific
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
and really depend on their cash flows
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
and their other revenues um
 
02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
you know not operating losses are not
 
02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:41.390 align:start position:0%
you know not operating losses are not
necessarily

02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:44.470 align:start position:0%
necessarily
[Music]

02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
well they are cash losses but oftentimes
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:53.189 --> 02:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
expenses that the government grants to
 
02:00:56.070 --> 02:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
them that are benefits for example
 
02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:57.350 align:start position:0%
them that are benefits for example
100

02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
100
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
capital expensing
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
so i may go buy a piece of equipment
 
02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
where under prior law i had to deduct
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
that slowly over a long period of time
 
02:01:10.629 --> 02:01:10.639 align:start position:0%
from my income
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
today i can deduct that all in one year
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
and that gives me if i'm investing in a
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
huge piece of equipment or factory
 
02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
equipment or something that gives me a
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
huge net operating loss in that year
 
02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
i may be generating cash flow in future
 
02:01:28.709 --> 02:01:28.719 align:start position:0%
years that i can still operate my
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
business but i may end up losing that
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
not operating loss so
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
it may or may not
 
02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:37.910 align:start position:0%
it may or may not
cause

02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
cause
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
a company to go out of business that's
 
02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:41.679 align:start position:0%
just very effects and circumstances
 
02:01:41.679 --> 02:01:44.470 align:start position:0%
just very effects and circumstances
dependent

02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
representation thank you mr chair and
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so i
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
want to be clear on something you just
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
said because
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
in the end a net operating loss that's
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
carried forward ultimately be realized
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
if after a period of time
 
02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
they become profitable i think we're
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
using a hundred thousand dollar example
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
so i make a hundred thousand dollar loss
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
in the first year but then i make a
 
02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
profit in the second year of a hundred
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
thousand i can deduct that eighty eighty
 
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
thousand of the first year's loss in the
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
second year and then i can deduct the
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
full that what's left over is 20 grand
 
02:02:19.589 --> 02:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
in the third year i can deduct that from
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars in profit and
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'm only paying taxes on eighty thousand
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
dollars is that my understanding of what
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
the way this plays out so in the end you
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
get your your full no well covered over
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
the course of the year and and
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
is that the way it plays out i guess
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's the federal treatment yes
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has additional limitations
 
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
that could impact that
 
02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:44.310 align:start position:0%
that could impact that
um

02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
which we're not really here to discuss
 
02:02:47.589 --> 02:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
but you have the 10 million dollar carry
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
forward limitation
 
02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:51.679 align:start position:0%
so for a large company that invests 100
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars in a plant
 
02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:55.750 align:start position:0%
million dollars in a plant
um

02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
that can deduct that on day one they
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
only get to carry forward 10 million of
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
that loft so they automatically right
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
off the bat lose
 
02:03:06.070 --> 02:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
90 million dollars of that that
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
deduction that benefit
 
02:03:08.239 --> 02:03:09.750 align:start position:0%
deduction that benefit
um

02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:10.550 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh then you have the 10-year carry
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
forward period so you have to assume
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
that you
 
02:03:17.589 --> 02:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
you know generate enough income within
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
that 10-year period to use the losses
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
that you can carry forward
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
so the the double apportionment just
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
exacerbates you know the impact of those
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
other limitations that are already in
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
place one follow-up mr chair follow-up
 
02:03:31.679 --> 02:03:32.470 align:start position:0%
place one follow-up mr chair follow-up
so

02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:34.229 --> 02:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
how does that work on the federal side
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
right now so again you have that hundred
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
million dollar loss you could deduct
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
that in its entirety on the federal side
 
02:03:42.149 --> 02:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
and then deduct it again in the state
 
02:03:42.159 --> 02:03:45.830 align:start position:0%
and then deduct it again in the state
side

02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.669 --> 02:03:47.679 align:start position:0%
on the federal side it works exactly as
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
you described a moment ago
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry i'm not sure i understand
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
the question i guess my question is so
 
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
on the federal taxes that are owed
 
02:03:58.149 --> 02:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
you would
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're using 100 million dollar example
 
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
you just use right way beyond new
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire's 10 million dollars but that
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
100 million dollar example
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
would still apply to the federal level
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
right so you would be able to deduct
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
that at the federal level but at the
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
state level you'd only be able to deduct
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars of that loss is that
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
is that what i understand you're saying
 
02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
if you assume that the hundred million
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
dollars was equivalent to to your loss
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
you bernstein followed by
 
02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:26.790 align:start position:0%
you bernstein followed by
representatives

02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
coming to new hampshire to answer our
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
questions we appreciate it
 
02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719 align:start position:0%
the 10 million limit on the net
 
02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
operating loss is
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh generally no
 
02:04:45.199 --> 02:04:46.470 align:start position:0%
uh generally no
um

02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
i think there may be one other state
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania has a sort of limitation
 
02:04:59.109 --> 02:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
but it is not a strict dollar amount
 
02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's a percentage of your future taxable
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
income similar to what federal does with
 
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
the 80 percent but pennsylvania's is 40
 
02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
so you do get to carry that forward and
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
they have a 20-year carry-forward period
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
um but they have a
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
a lower percentage cap
 
02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:16.950 align:start position:0%
a lower percentage cap
um

02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
but generally no other states do not do
 
02:05:21.669 --> 02:05:21.679 align:start position:0%
that okay and then one more question mr
 
02:05:21.679 --> 02:05:22.709 align:start position:0%
that okay and then one more question mr
chair

02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
regarding the 80 limitation have any
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
other states to your knowledge removed
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
that and become uh so they're not in
 
02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
harmony with the internal revenue code
 
02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:32.069 align:start position:0%
harmony with the internal revenue code
but

02:05:32.069 --> 02:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit friendlier to
 
02:05:34.950 --> 02:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
businesses um thank you for that
 
02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:36.229 align:start position:0%
businesses um thank you for that
question

02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
some states have adopted the 80 and some
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
states have not adopted i don't know how
 
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
many but there is a mixture not all
 
02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
states have gone to the federal
 
02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:49.669 align:start position:0%
states have gone to the federal
calculation

02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
there are many states who have remained
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
with their prior laws that were in place
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
before the tcja act adopted that okay
 
02:06:00.310 --> 02:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just a
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
clarification on that 100 million dollar
 
02:06:03.599 --> 02:06:04.629 align:start position:0%
clarification on that 100 million dollar
example

02:06:04.629 --> 02:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
where new hampshire is limited to 10
 
02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:07.510 align:start position:0%
where new hampshire is limited to 10
million

02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
so now there's 90 million left so then
 
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
the next year
 
02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
were you saying that that's it for on
 
02:06:18.550 --> 02:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
that on that particular transaction or
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
the next year they'd have that 10
 
02:06:20.079 --> 02:06:21.030 align:start position:0%
the next year they'd have that 10
million

02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
of the 90 million
 
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
no the limit
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
if you
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
if you assumed you had 100 million
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
dollar loss for whatever reason
 
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
you can only carry forward 10 million of
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
that the other 90 is gone forever you
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
never get to use that in new hampshire
 
02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:43.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
i want to remind the committee that we
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
will be having a work session
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
one two three
 
02:06:51.119 --> 02:06:53.669 align:start position:0%
one two three
more

02:06:53.669 --> 02:06:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
sets to go
 
02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
so representative brownie
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
you know when i when i see thank you
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
when i see uh section 172 i think of
 
02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
accelerated depreciation
 
02:07:06.229 --> 02:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do with that doesn't
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
it no 172 is the nol provisions 179 is
 
02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
expected 179. thank you welcome
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:16.719 --> 02:07:18.950 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
yes on
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
so the 90 million is gone because the
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
federal form no longer contains that
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
depreciation right
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
no the 90 million is gone because new
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire law imposes a 10 million
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
dollar carry forward limitation on net
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
operating losses
 
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:38.790 align:start position:0%
operating losses
but

02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
we only recognize
 
02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:44.229 align:start position:0%
we only recognize
those

02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:44.239 --> 02:07:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire allows the deduction so
 
02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
if you're in an income situation and you
 
02:07:52.629 --> 02:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
take that full deduction you get the
 
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
full benefit but if you take that
 
02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
deduction and it puts you in a net
 
02:07:57.990 --> 02:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
operating loss position
 
02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.030 align:start position:0%
operating loss position
then

02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
effectively that 10 million dollar
 
02:08:02.709 --> 02:08:02.719 align:start position:0%
limitation takes away the benefit of
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
that deduction that 90 million dollars
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
forever assuming that would put you in a
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
not operating lost position
 
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
but in that case if you invest a hundred
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh in a
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
machine for seabrook
 
02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:20.149 align:start position:0%
machine for seabrook
on

02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
and we removed the 10 million deduction
 
02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:25.510 align:start position:0%
and we removed the 10 million deduction
requirement

02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
then on we would be faced with a deficit
 
02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
of 100 million dollars in our budget
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
well the 100 million dollars would be
 
02:08:38.149 --> 02:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
the the loss not the tax amount you'd
 
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
have to apportion that
 
02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
apply the tax rate to get to the tax
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
number but we are not advocating that
 
02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
you eliminate the 10 million dollar
 
02:08:50.149 --> 02:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
deduction we're simply here
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
advocating that you eliminate the double
 
02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:56.470 align:start position:0%
advocating that you eliminate the double
apportionment

02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:58.149 --> 02:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
 
02:09:02.310 --> 02:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd like to ask a question for
 
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
the work session
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
are there places in the new hampshire
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
tax code where we give greater benefit
 
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
this does sound like something
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
we'd want to back away from
 
02:09:18.629 --> 02:09:18.639 align:start position:0%
and conform with the federal law but are
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
there places where
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
being a new hampshire taxpayer
 
02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
is an advantage because we have
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
less onerous
 
02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
taxes than the federal code so in other
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
words are we balancing something
 
02:09:37.350 --> 02:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
through this or
 
02:09:40.149 --> 02:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
is this something we really want to
 
02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
eliminate so that's a that's really a
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
sort of a bigger question you might want
 
02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
to ask the dra when we finally
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
get them to come up here good but
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's after a couple more cycles and
 
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
it is a quarter after 12.
 
02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
any further questions of
 
02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
these people
 
02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes um
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
representative tucker there are a couple
 
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
of provisions that i can point out
 
02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:13.599 align:start position:0%
one is 163 j of the internal revenue
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
code which is an interest expense
 
02:10:16.079 --> 02:10:18.870 align:start position:0%
code which is an interest expense
limitation

02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
at the federal level there there's a
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
limitation on the amount of interest
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
expense that can be deducted and iowa d
 
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
cup i'm sorry new hampshire decouples
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
from that provision and allows the full
 
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
interest deduction
 
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
there's also the
 
02:10:38.310 --> 02:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
global intangible low taxed income
 
02:10:39.669 --> 02:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
provision in the federal internal
 
02:10:42.149 --> 02:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
revenue code which i'm not an expert in
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
but requires taxation of some of the
 
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
which new hampshire also decouples from
 
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
but the problem with this
 
02:10:58.170 --> 02:10:58.180 align:start position:0%
your your your um
 
02:10:58.180 --> 02:10:59.990 align:start position:0%

02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
i apologize i may be misspeaking i'm
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
working on a similar bill in another
 
02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
state and i may be confused so please
 
02:11:12.550 --> 02:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
disregard that comment
 
02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:14.870 align:start position:0%
disregard that comment
um

02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
i apologize my personal privilege
 
02:11:21.109 --> 02:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
here is that
 
02:11:23.189 --> 02:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
the example that you had with 100
 
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
million dollar loss
 
02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
for the federal government they could
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
take the whole 100 million dollar loss
 
02:11:32.709 --> 02:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
under both federal law and new hampshire
 
02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
law you can
 
02:11:40.470 --> 02:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
deduct i'm just a federal the federal
 
02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
yes federal laws expense allows
 
02:11:45.990 --> 02:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
100 expensing
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
of capital expenditure so if you invest
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
in a piece of equipment you get to
 
02:11:51.910 --> 02:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
deduct that if it causes you to have a
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
nut operating loss you can carry that
 
02:11:56.550 --> 02:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
forward and deduct it in future years
 
02:11:59.350 --> 02:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
indefinitely and where new hampshire
 
02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:01.350 align:start position:0%
indefinitely and where new hampshire
starts

02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
starts
 
02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
with the federal
 
02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:04.550 align:start position:0%
with the federal
number

02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
that federal number shows the entire
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollar
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
removed from their profit so new
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire will stop
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
a smaller number now
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
let's say they had 10 million dollars
 
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
worth i mean
 
02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
a hundred and
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
one million dollars worth of profit
 
02:12:29.270 --> 02:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
they could deduct a hundred million
 
02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
dollars from that they end up with one
 
02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of profit then new
 
02:12:36.390 --> 02:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire would start and look at that
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
one million dollar profit and then go
 
02:12:39.119 --> 02:12:40.550 align:start position:0%
one million dollar profit and then go
forward

02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that people
 
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
understand yes it's only in the case
 
02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
where you have an nol that these
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
problems come into effect right correct
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
representation union uh more just a a
 
02:12:57.750 --> 02:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
question slash comment on what you just
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
said if there was a depreciation
 
02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
um if that ended up that 100 million was
 
02:13:05.430 --> 02:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
a depreciation but that depreciation
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't allowed in new hampshire
 
02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
that could affect the answer
 
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
so it might not be a million dollars
 
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
just interject something on that
 
02:13:18.149 --> 02:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
representative romney yeah that's that's
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
why i bought i misspoke it was 179 we
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
don't conform to 179 either
 
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
we do have a cap
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
on 179. once 179 is a is a small uh
 
02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.030 align:start position:0%
on 179. once 179 is a is a small uh
business

02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
provision uh the 100 expenses expensing
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
that i'm referring to is under 168k
 
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
which is the depreciation section okay
 
02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll talk to you and i was
 
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
just using that by way of an example for
 
02:13:46.550 --> 02:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
the numbers not necessarily the specific
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
um deduction but
 
02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
to represe just reflect what the problem
 
02:13:55.030 --> 02:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:57.750 --> 02:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay let me ask
 
02:14:00.870 --> 02:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
i assume there's no more questions this
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony let me
 
02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
ask the committee
 
02:14:06.550 --> 02:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity go until
 
02:14:08.149 --> 02:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
12 30
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
and then take a break
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
and then come back because we still have
 
02:14:12.719 --> 02:14:14.310 align:start position:0%
and then come back because we still have
uh

02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
mr moore
 
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
and then the bia
 
02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
and then the dra
 
02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to finish it if we um i think
 
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
we should just finish
 
02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
up just finish up
 
02:14:28.709 --> 02:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
okay then uh
 
02:14:37.350 --> 02:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:38.830 --> 02:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is greg
 
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
moore i'm a state director with
 
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
americans for prosperity here in new
 
02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:44.390 align:start position:0%
americans for prosperity here in new
hampshire

02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh we support senate bill 435 largely
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
because it does get rid of the double
 
02:14:50.550 --> 02:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
apportionment which is
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
again an outlier and it's a competitive
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
hindrance for the state
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
i don't want to
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
try to over ground it's already this
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
this committee's particularly when i'm
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
in between you and lunch
 
02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh i mean that's the most dangerous
 
02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
place to be
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh but i want to talk a little bit about
 
02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
about what the gentleman from nashville
 
02:15:09.199 --> 02:15:10.149 align:start position:0%
about what the gentleman from nashville
raised

02:15:10.149 --> 02:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
raised
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
because we were very involved in the tax
 
02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
cut and jobs act process and part of the
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
reason for going to the 80 percent and
 
02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the time limitation
 
02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
was because it was part of an effort to
 
02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
smooth the business cycles
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
and ultimately the goal was was to see a
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
little a lot less of the cyclicality in
 
02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
fact there's a lot of programs at the
 
02:15:34.550 --> 02:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
federal level where they're trying to
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
make the programs less dependent on a
 
02:15:38.069 --> 02:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
business cycle
 
02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
that was part of the rationale for the
 
02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
80 and eliminating the cap and
 
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
to the gentleman's point
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
if you're going to institute the 80 in
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
conformity i think it only makes sense
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
to get rid of the 10-year cap so that
 
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
you allow people the time to to get
 
02:15:57.030 --> 02:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
those operating losses in perpetuity
 
02:16:00.149 --> 02:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
until they're made whole eventually so
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
but there was a rationale for it it
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't just on the
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
on the the 10-year because as you know
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
in the federal level they budgeted out
 
02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
10 years it wasn't just on on the
 
02:16:11.109 --> 02:16:11.119 align:start position:0%
marking up of the bill
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
there was a rationale to try to smooth
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
out some of the business cycles during
 
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
the process of the discussion of the tax
 
02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
cut and jobs act so i just wanted to
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
raise that out there and i'll stop with
 
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
that because like i said i know the
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
worst place to be is between reps and
 
02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:24.149 align:start position:0%
worst place to be is between reps and
lunch

02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
02:16:24.159 --> 02:16:25.430 align:start position:0%
lunch
okay

02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:16:27.109 --> 02:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to take any questions
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:31.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
chair testimony

02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
chair testimony
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
reptile bernstein hey um
 
02:16:36.389 --> 02:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
forgive me for stretching this out but
 
02:16:39.509 --> 02:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
explain to me how the 80 cap smooths out
 
02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
the business cycle
 
02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
because typically when you have a
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
recession you end up a lot with a lot of
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
businesses with net operating losses
 
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
and as you come out of that business
 
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
cycle the economy typically takes
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh i think they say as much as three
 
02:16:56.709 --> 02:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
years typically come out of recession
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
before they reach their most robust
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
levels by stretching out
 
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh the stretching out those payments
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
you end up with a dynamic where where
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
the cyclicality you don't see you don't
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
see a rapid spike
 
02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
of immediate drop off and then you see
 
02:17:16.389 --> 02:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
for two or three years a long a long
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
pause before you start to see the the
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
the money come back
 
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
so the revenue on the revenue side you
 
02:17:23.669 --> 02:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
find a way to
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
smooth those out and as we've seen at
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
the federal level
 
02:17:29.349 --> 02:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
revenues tend to be pretty chaotic if
 
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
you were to look back over the last 30
 
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
years if just if you were to look at a
 
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
bar graph comparing new hampshire and
 
02:17:39.509 --> 02:17:39.519 align:start position:0%
the u.s
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
the u.s the u.s revenue picture is is
 
02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
much more of a
 
02:17:45.509 --> 02:17:45.519 align:start position:0%
thing like this than new hampshire which
 
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
has been a lot smoother
 
02:17:48.549 --> 02:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
probably thanks to the members of this
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
committee of course
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your answer and i
 
02:17:54.469 --> 02:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate your brevity too thank you
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
greg if you don't mind one more sorry
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely so i i want to take this off
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
the hot seat sorry almost almost i want
 
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
to talk about this um a question around
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
the 10-year carry forward um and lines
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
13 through i guess it's 13 through uh
 
02:18:17.669 --> 02:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
24 of the bill i think is where where we
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
have a 10 million dollar cap and we have
 
02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
a 10-year limitation
 
02:18:22.830 --> 02:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
i think that's where that all comes into
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
play is it your inclination that that
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
puts us at a disadvantage if we leave
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
that language in
 
02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
so if you if you keep the conformity
 
02:18:31.679 --> 02:18:32.629 align:start position:0%
so if you if you keep the conformity
that's

02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
in line 27 and 28 which is striking the
 
02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
reference to the tax code of 1996
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
that would then make it just synced up
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
with the section 172. one of the one of
 
02:18:46.309 --> 02:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
the challenges with that is
 
02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
as we discussed in 2019 in the budget
 
02:18:51.509 --> 02:18:51.519 align:start position:0%
which of course included
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
a number of provisions of conformity not
 
02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
this particular one
 
02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:18:58.549 --> 02:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
if you strike the provision as you see
 
02:19:00.110 --> 02:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
in 27 and
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
2028 you end up with a dynamic where
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
if the federal government then in turn
 
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
changes its tax policy ours
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
automatically basically what we would
 
02:19:11.349 --> 02:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
describe as incorporating by reference
 
02:19:11.359 --> 02:19:12.389 align:start position:0%
describe as incorporating by reference
um

02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:12.399 --> 02:19:15.190 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.629 --> 02:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
obviously there
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
we would argue is getting rid of the
 
02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
10-year cap if you're going to keep this
 
02:19:23.190 --> 02:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
provision in place where you strike it
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
out but there are several options one be
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
to take this provision out in lines 27
 
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
and 28.
 
02:19:31.669 --> 02:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
another provision would be the option
 
02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
would be to
 
02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
get rid of the 10-year cap and the third
 
02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
option would be
 
02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.190 align:start position:0%
option would be
to

02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
get rid of 10-year cap and instead of
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
changing it to striking the reference
 
02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:41.990 align:start position:0%
changing it to striking the reference
entirely

02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
you change it to the to the tax code of
 
02:19:44.399 --> 02:19:48.070 align:start position:0%
you change it to the to the tax code of
2018.

02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
which at least means that if you're
 
02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
engage in further conformity efforts it
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
has to come through the legislative
 
02:19:55.990 --> 02:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
process as opposed as opposed to simply
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
being incorporated by reference when
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh when the federal government makes a
 
02:20:02.469 --> 02:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
policy change
 
02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of ways to slice to
 
02:20:06.790 --> 02:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
slice this but it's ultimately it's up
 
02:20:08.389 --> 02:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
to you as to which way you want to go
 
02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
so just one follow-up mr chair follow-up
 
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
so again i guess i'm getting to the two
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
points that you made one was the 10-year
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
limitation one was the 10 million dollar
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
limitation and now those are outliers to
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
the federal government i i didn't make
 
02:20:24.469 --> 02:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
the 10 million that was a prior speaker
 
02:20:26.309 --> 02:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
i was talking about the 10-year
 
02:20:28.830 --> 02:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
02:20:35.110 --> 02:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
we have two cards from the bia
 
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:49.590 --> 02:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is dave
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
giuvam senior vice president for public
 
02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
policy with the business and industry
 
02:20:57.359 --> 02:20:58.710 align:start position:0%
policy with the business and industry
association

02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:21:01.110 --> 02:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
and with me today is steve lawler he's
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
been before this committee many times
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
he's a partner at nathan wexler here in
 
02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:06.150 align:start position:0%
he's a partner at nathan wexler here in
concord

02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
concord
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
and he is also the chair of bia's fiscal
 
02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
policy committee so we are here in favor
 
02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill today uh many of you will
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
remember uh from the past a radio
 
02:21:17.830 --> 02:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
personality named fred harvey and he
 
02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
would always talk about a
 
02:21:21.910 --> 02:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
something and then he'd pause and say
 
02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
and now the rest of the story
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to present the rest of the
 
02:21:28.630 --> 02:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
story the genesis of this bill and the
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
path it has taken uh so far this
 
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
legislative session to get to you
 
02:21:35.830 --> 02:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
i fielded a call from one of our bia
 
02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:36.870 align:start position:0%
i fielded a call from one of our bia
members

02:21:36.870 --> 02:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
last summer
 
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
saying um i've got a question about what
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
seems to be a sort of an odd new
 
02:21:43.590 --> 02:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire quirk
 
02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i said okay what what is it and she
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
goes well it involves net operating
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
losses and are you aware that
 
02:21:52.870 --> 02:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
you know for multi-state companies they
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
have to apportion their nol the way they
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
apportion their taxes and i said yes i'm
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
aware that she goes well were you also
 
02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
aware when they
 
02:22:04.150 --> 02:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
take that deduction in subsequent years
 
02:22:06.309 --> 02:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
they have to apportion it again
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
rendering it almost useless and i said
 
02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
no i wasn't aware of that this is news
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
so we disgusted our fiscal policy
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
committee and decided we would approach
 
02:22:20.469 --> 02:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
the legislature to try and remove
 
02:22:23.429 --> 02:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
that second nol apportionment and
 
02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative all me i i trust you were
 
02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:27.590 align:start position:0%
representative all me i i trust you were
now

02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
cognizant of what the second
 
02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
apportionment is when we're talking
 
02:22:32.950 --> 02:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
about it
 
02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:34.150 align:start position:0%
about it
so

02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:22:36.389 --> 02:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
we thought this was relatively simple we
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
approached senator bob gaida to be the
 
02:22:41.670 --> 02:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor he agreed that
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was really
 
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
out of whack with every other state as
 
02:22:47.429 --> 02:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
it were
 
02:22:50.230 --> 02:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
as it relates to nol apportionments he
 
02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
agreed to sponsor the bill
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
i thought this is easy peasy
 
02:22:57.270 --> 02:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
so sometime in mid-december i'm sitting
 
02:22:59.429 --> 02:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
at my desk i'm minding my own business
 
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not bothering anyone and i get a
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
call from senator bob guidan i say hello
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
good morning he goes bob gaida is not
 
02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:08.230 align:start position:0%
good morning he goes bob gaida is not
happy

02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
happy
 
02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
now if you're a lobbyist the last five
 
02:23:12.070 --> 02:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
words you want to hear in the world is
 
02:23:14.230 --> 02:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
bob guida is not happy
 
02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
and so i asked him
 
02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
what was the cause of his unhappiness
 
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
and he said when you sat down with me
 
02:23:22.710 --> 02:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
you said you wanted to correct this
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
double apportionment issue and that's
 
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
what i agreed to
 
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
but the draft of the bill i just got
 
02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
from uh legislative services you're also
 
02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
removing the
 
02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
10 million dollar threshold or cap and
 
02:23:37.349 --> 02:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
the 10-year carry forward cap and do you
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
know what that is going to do to new
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire revenues
 
02:23:42.230 --> 02:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i said
 
02:23:44.790 --> 02:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
no but i imagine it's it's going to have
 
02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
a significant impact
 
02:23:48.389 --> 02:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
but you should know i never in the
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
language we drafted for legislative
 
02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
services to use we never asked for that
 
02:23:54.790 --> 02:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
we didn't ask for the removal of the cap
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
or the removal of the 10-year carry
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
forward and i don't want to call it a
 
02:24:00.070 --> 02:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
drafting error because i don't think it
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
was i think it was a drafting
 
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding where they just removed
 
02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
the whole section dealing with with
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
apportionment and in doing so it also
 
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
removed the cap and also removed the
 
02:24:13.270 --> 02:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
carry forward provisions so they
 
02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:14.469 align:start position:0%
carry forward provisions so they
redrafted

02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
redrafted
 
02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
the bill which um we were beyond the
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
drafting deadlines at that point so it
 
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
had to be
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
the the bill was printed in the original
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
language with the understanding at the
 
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
senate hearing
 
02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
this new amended version would be
 
02:24:29.349 --> 02:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
offered by the sponsor
 
02:24:29.359 --> 02:24:30.550 align:start position:0%
offered by the sponsor
uh

02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:24:33.110 --> 02:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with what we wanted to deal with
 
02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
which was that second nol apportionment
 
02:24:39.429 --> 02:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
included in the the new amendment
 
02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
something we did not ask for
 
02:24:43.510 --> 02:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
was this updating of of the new
 
02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:44.550 align:start position:0%
was this updating of of the new
hampshire

02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
tax codes to reflect the federal irs
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
2018 tax codes
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't ask for that
 
02:24:55.349 --> 02:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
but i have to say we didn't strongly
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
object to it and i'd like to explain why
 
02:25:00.469 --> 02:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
one reason is the tax code that we're
 
02:25:02.309 --> 02:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
operating under right now i think is
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
from 1997.
 
02:25:07.270 --> 02:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
and that's a long time ago and doesn't
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
really reflect
 
02:25:11.670 --> 02:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
it's causing practitioners to to go back
 
02:25:14.710 --> 02:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
to the 1997 irs code and somehow
 
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
rationalize that with their with their
 
02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
current tax filings so we thought it
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
just is a general practice it wasn't a
 
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
bad idea
 
02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:26.070 align:start position:0%
bad idea
to

02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:27.910 align:start position:0%
to
introduce

02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
bringing new hampshire into compliance
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
with the 2018 irs code the second thing
 
02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
it did and it's reflected in the
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
02:25:39.030 --> 02:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
is it does bring
 
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
some revenue
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
back to new hampshire that would be lost
 
02:25:45.429 --> 02:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
by just
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
getting rid of that second apportionment
 
02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:48.309 align:start position:0%
getting rid of that second apportionment
so

02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make the bill revenue neutral
 
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
the state would see
 
02:25:55.270 --> 02:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
what i think is a small
 
02:25:57.270 --> 02:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
loss in the grand scheme of things but
 
02:26:00.309 --> 02:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
it does mitigate that loss
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
i think that concludes my testimony
 
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot about it
 
02:26:08.309 --> 02:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
but let me quickly turn it over to steve
 
02:26:12.309 --> 02:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
just for clarity purposes currently the
 
02:26:19.110 --> 02:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:26:22.309 --> 02:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
conforms to the 2018
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
irs code for most
 
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
of of the tax law however in this
 
02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:31.270 align:start position:0%
of of the tax law however in this
statute

02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
only the statute has
 
02:26:36.230 --> 02:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
a reference to the 1996 code
 
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
so it was it was buried in that statute
 
02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
but currently
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
the tax code that we are following is
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
the 2018 for all
 
02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
other aspects of the
 
02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:49.990 align:start position:0%
other aspects of the
business

02:26:49.990 --> 02:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
profit tax
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
this is not a bill
 
02:26:57.270 --> 02:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
that only affects those multinational
 
02:26:58.950 --> 02:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
companies i mean this is a bill that
 
02:27:00.070 --> 02:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
could affect
 
02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses that may
 
02:27:02.399 --> 02:27:03.429 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses that may
sell

02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
sell
 
02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
their their
 
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
their goods in more than one state it
 
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
could be a small business that sells
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
to vermont it could be a small business
 
02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
that sells to another state
 
02:27:14.319 --> 02:27:15.750 align:start position:0%
that sells to another state
massachusetts

02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't only affect
 
02:27:19.990 --> 02:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
multinational businesses it does affect
 
02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
businesses that do sell
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
to other states
 
02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to give you an example
 
02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
of how this works
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
and i know there's been a couple
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
questions and there will be something
 
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
that will be
 
02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
given to the committee but i'm going to
 
02:27:36.550 --> 02:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
give you a really simple example so
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
let's talk about a business that in year
 
02:27:41.670 --> 02:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
one loses a hundred thousand dollars
 
02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:43.270 align:start position:0%
one loses a hundred thousand dollars
they

02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:27:45.349 --> 02:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
they file in two states they file in new
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire and they file in another state
 
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
and fifty percent of their income is new
 
02:27:50.710 --> 02:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire and fifty percent of their
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
income is another state
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
so they have a hundred thousand dollar
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
gross loss
 
02:27:57.750 --> 02:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
they apportion fifty percent of it so
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars is a portion to
 
02:28:00.630 --> 02:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
and that is their nol carry forward
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
year two
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
the business makes two hundred thousand
 
02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
dollars gross profit
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
the way the current law works is the two
 
02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars is their gross
 
02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:14.710 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars is their gross
profit

02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
profit
 
02:28:16.950 --> 02:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
the fifty thousand abortion loss is
 
02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
applied to that gross profit
 
02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
giving a uh net profit of a hundred
 
02:28:23.990 --> 02:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
fifty of it is a apportioned to new
 
02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire so that's 75 000 and 50 is
 
02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
apportioned to the other state which is
 
02:28:32.550 --> 02:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
75 000
 
02:28:34.469 --> 02:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
so the the the business is going to pay
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
tax on 75 000
 
02:28:38.070 --> 02:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
if we get rid of the double
 
02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:39.830 align:start position:0%
if we get rid of the double
apportionment

02:28:39.830 --> 02:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
then that two hundred thousand dollar
 
02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:42.950 align:start position:0%
then that two hundred thousand dollar
income

02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:28:45.190 --> 02:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
is apportioned first so that two hundred
 
02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar income is a portion to
 
02:28:49.110 --> 02:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire of fifty percent which is
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars and then we
 
02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:52.150 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars and then we
apply

02:28:52.150 --> 02:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
apply
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
the fifty thousand dollar nol
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
which now means that the business will
 
02:28:58.870 --> 02:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
only pay taxes on fifty thousand dollars
 
02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
instead of the seventy five thousand
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
dollars they would have paid if this
 
02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
double apportionment
 
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
is is happening so it's a simple example
 
02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
um but if you can see that it does hurt
 
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
businesses because now they're they pay
 
02:29:13.429 --> 02:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
extra taxes because they're really
 
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
and like i said it's
 
02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:21.190 align:start position:0%
and like i said it's
it's

02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:29:23.030 --> 02:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
it affects you know smaller business as
 
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
well as multinational businesses
 
02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:26.070 align:start position:0%
well as multinational businesses
and

02:29:26.070 --> 02:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:29.270 --> 02:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
as i said the we do conform to the 2018
 
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
code but is only in this provision of
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
the statute that the 1996 code is being
 
02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:36.630 align:start position:0%
the statute that the 1996 code is being
used

02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
used
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:46.389 --> 02:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
i've just been asked could you
 
02:29:49.590 --> 02:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
draw that out into a diagram
 
02:29:51.270 --> 02:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
and give it to the committee thank you
 
02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:52.469 align:start position:0%
and give it to the committee thank you
yeah

02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:29:54.790 --> 02:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
questions represent alani
 
02:29:56.230 --> 02:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
yes on
 
02:29:59.110 --> 02:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see that
 
02:30:02.070 --> 02:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
example written down
 
02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
and any any other that you thought was a
 
02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
variant on it that would be interesting
 
02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think that was very helpful
 
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's almost lunch and our brains are
 
02:30:14.550 --> 02:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
going crazy
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:18.800 --> 02:30:21.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:30:21.910 --> 02:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:25.270 --> 02:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh mr chauvet that explanation of the
 
02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:26.630 align:start position:0%
uh mr chauvet that explanation of the
background

02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
background
 
02:30:29.349 --> 02:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
the origin of this bill was very helpful
 
02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
and it really fits in with what my
 
02:30:35.270 --> 02:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
understanding was as i entered into this
 
02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:36.550 align:start position:0%
understanding was as i entered into this
discussion

02:30:36.550 --> 02:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
that this was really an attempt at what
 
02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
you might call even a technical eff fix
 
02:30:46.630 --> 02:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
a fix of of a provision that uh
 
02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
was when you look closely at it
 
02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:50.870 align:start position:0%
was when you look closely at it
um

02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:52.230 align:start position:0%
um
unfair

02:30:52.230 --> 02:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
unfair
 
02:30:54.309 --> 02:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
and it didn't make a lot of sense so
 
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get to it
 
02:30:59.190 --> 02:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
an apportionment that's not a double
 
02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:00.230 align:start position:0%
an apportionment that's not a double
portion

02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
portion
 
02:31:02.469 --> 02:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
and that sort of tells the story the way
 
02:31:04.469 --> 02:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
i just said it
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
and as such and then the fixing of the
 
02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
irs code reference
 
02:31:09.520 --> 02:31:10.870 align:start position:0%
irs code reference
is

02:31:10.870 --> 02:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
is extending a process that we began a
 
02:31:17.670 --> 02:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
few years whenever we did it to conform
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh to the more recent irs code with some
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
exceptions that we thought through very
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know as carefully as we can in this
 
02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:26.950 align:start position:0%
you know as carefully as we can in this
process

02:31:26.950 --> 02:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:31:29.110 --> 02:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
so that's the way i received this bill
 
02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
and that's the way i'm looking at it
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
right now so it means that
 
02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
we certainly can
 
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
be adventurous and go
 
02:31:38.240 --> 02:31:39.110 align:start position:0%
be adventurous and go
go

02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
further afield to big time changes but
 
02:31:45.270 --> 02:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
that's not the way the senate treated it
 
02:31:47.590 --> 02:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
and not the way it's coming here
 
02:31:49.270 --> 02:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
and i guess i would
 
02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
is that is what i just said constantly
 
02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
with what you were trying to say
 
02:31:57.910 --> 02:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
yes our our original
 
02:32:00.070 --> 02:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
intent was specifically related to the
 
02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
double apportionment issue which we
 
02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
viewed as unfair and also inconsistent
 
02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
with how every other state handles uh
 
02:32:11.429 --> 02:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
nol apportionment um are thinking what
 
02:32:13.349 --> 02:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
we recognize there likely would be a
 
02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact which there is and it's
 
02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's spelled out in your your fiscal
 
02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
note but we thought
 
02:32:21.429 --> 02:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a pretty small
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
universe of companies first of all we're
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
talking about multi-state companies and
 
02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
then it's even smaller than that we're
 
02:32:29.910 --> 02:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
talking about multi-state companies that
 
02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
that suffer a loss and obviously that's
 
02:32:35.830 --> 02:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
not every multi-state company so
 
02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
our thinking was that this was the right
 
02:32:38.479 --> 02:32:39.670 align:start position:0%
our thinking was that this was the right
thing

02:32:39.670 --> 02:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:32:41.670 --> 02:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
for public policy for new hampshire to
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
do both for fairness and to make us
 
02:32:46.469 --> 02:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
competitive with how other states are
 
02:32:48.389 --> 02:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
treating this issue
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
everything else that we've spent most of
 
02:32:52.710 --> 02:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
the hearing talking about were not
 
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
things that the bia asked for i would
 
02:32:56.710 --> 02:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
say and you i think you're going to hear
 
02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
from the dra
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
one question that hasn't come up is what
 
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
is the fiscal impact of removing that 10
 
02:33:05.030 --> 02:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars and the 10-year carry
 
02:33:06.950 --> 02:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
forward and i don't know if they have
 
02:33:09.030 --> 02:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
those figures with them today but i can
 
02:33:12.150 --> 02:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
tell you it is substantial so that's
 
02:33:14.309 --> 02:33:14.319 align:start position:0%
something you have to measure i i would
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
love to argue that on behalf of
 
02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
employers but you have to weigh that
 
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
with what the fiscal impact is and in
 
02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
the impact that what that would have on
 
02:33:24.710 --> 02:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire budget yeah good thank
 
02:33:28.309 --> 02:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:31.590 --> 02:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:32.830 --> 02:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
02:33:35.590 --> 02:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
much now
 
02:33:55.110 --> 02:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:57.190 --> 02:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
good morning carolyn lear assistant
 
02:33:58.469 --> 02:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner with the department of
 
02:33:58.479 --> 02:34:03.830 align:start position:0%
commissioner with the department of
revenue

02:34:03.830 --> 02:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm primarily happy to answer any of
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
your questions but if you would
 
02:34:11.270 --> 02:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
um let me talk about conformity for a
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
minute because i think um
 
02:34:17.750 --> 02:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
the history on how new hampshire has and
 
02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:19.190 align:start position:0%
the history on how new hampshire has and
hasn't

02:34:19.190 --> 02:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
hasn't
 
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
conformed to the internal revenue code
 
02:34:23.990 --> 02:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
is helpful
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
um and it's something that i've been
 
02:34:26.950 --> 02:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
sort of working on with you all for a
 
02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:28.309 align:start position:0%
sort of working on with you all for a
while

02:34:28.309 --> 02:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
while
 
02:34:28.319 --> 02:34:29.190 align:start position:0%
while
so

02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
you know in the early 2010s
 
02:34:35.670 --> 02:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was in the practice
 
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
of not updating our
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
reference to the internal revenue code
 
02:34:45.990 --> 02:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis and you know it's an
 
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
interesting question states do a number
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
of things
 
02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
some states on the far extreme
 
02:34:56.469 --> 02:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
automatically tie to any federal tax law
 
02:34:58.550 --> 02:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
change as it's made
 
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
and that certainly has an element of
 
02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
convenience but it also sort of
 
02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
abdicates a lot of state control over
 
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
their tax code right because
 
02:35:09.429 --> 02:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
you you have to affirmatively do
 
02:35:12.070 --> 02:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
something to say no we don't want to
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
implement that change for new hampshire
 
02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:15.030 align:start position:0%
implement that change for new hampshire
purposes

02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the spectrum
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
um our states who was sort of like where
 
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was where we um
 
02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
either tied to a very outdated code or
 
02:35:29.670 --> 02:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
in a couple of extremes didn't tie to a
 
02:35:31.830 --> 02:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
code at all and just had you know their
 
02:35:35.429 --> 02:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
own state level code essentially um
 
02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's really administratively
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
problematic it's my understanding that
 
02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's really difficult for taxpayers to
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
comply with
 
02:35:44.550 --> 02:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
so sort of i don't know that any of
 
02:35:46.389 --> 02:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
those extremes
 
02:35:47.510 --> 02:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
are great
 
02:35:50.550 --> 02:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has in recent history
 
02:35:53.270 --> 02:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
sort of paved a middle ground
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
where we periodically update our
 
02:35:58.389 --> 02:35:58.399 align:start position:0%
reference to the internal revenue code
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
while having a policy decision about
 
02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:01.910 align:start position:0%
while having a policy decision about
certain

02:36:01.910 --> 02:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
certain
 
02:36:05.110 --> 02:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
important material items that we might
 
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
want to decouple with i think
 
02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative abrami you've
 
02:36:11.349 --> 02:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple
 
02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
bonus depreciation and
 
02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
certain capital expense deductions under
 
02:36:18.950 --> 02:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
179 those are areas where new hampshire
 
02:36:21.510 --> 02:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
has had the policy discussion and made
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
the decision
 
02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
to specifically decouple from those
 
02:36:24.880 --> 02:36:26.710 align:start position:0%
to specifically decouple from those
provisions

02:36:26.710 --> 02:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
what i would say about the second
 
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill which would conform
 
02:36:32.640 --> 02:36:33.750 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill which would conform
to

02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:35.110 align:start position:0%
to
the

02:36:35.110 --> 02:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:36:37.270 --> 02:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
80 percent limitation
 
02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
on nol uses
 
02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
the 80 limitation being
 
02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers ability
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
to um deduct no more than 80 percent of
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
their income utilizing a loss
 
02:36:54.950 --> 02:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
i think the the first threshold question
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
we should have about that is is this a
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
material enough
 
02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:01.110 align:start position:0%
material enough
impact

02:37:01.110 --> 02:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:02.830 align:start position:0%
impact
to

02:37:02.830 --> 02:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
warrant specifically decoupling from and
 
02:37:06.479 --> 02:37:07.670 align:start position:0%
warrant specifically decoupling from and
currently

02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
in our statutes we specifically decouple
 
02:37:14.550 --> 02:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
from that treatment of nols by way of
 
02:37:17.150 --> 02:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
referring to the code of i think it was
 
02:37:20.309 --> 02:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
1997 is what we currently refer to now
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
is that a material enough item that it
 
02:37:26.550 --> 02:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
makes sense to to continue to decouple
 
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
from that and i can't answer that
 
02:37:30.309 --> 02:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
question for you but i think it's an
 
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
important threshold question to ask
 
02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
because if we have if we start having a
 
02:37:38.070 --> 02:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
policy conversation about every single
 
02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
difference between the new hampshire
 
02:37:41.830 --> 02:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
code and the federal code the list of
 
02:37:43.429 --> 02:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
items that we're going to need to think
 
02:37:45.990 --> 02:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
about on a yearly basis could get long
 
02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:47.349 align:start position:0%
about on a yearly basis could get long
quickly

02:37:47.349 --> 02:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
because the federal government is making
 
02:37:51.270 --> 02:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
changes on sometimes a weekly or a
 
02:37:54.150 --> 02:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
monthly basis to their federal code that
 
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
we then need to consider
 
02:37:58.710 --> 02:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
i don't that that wasn't something that
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
i say hoping to lead you into a
 
02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:02.070 align:start position:0%
i say hoping to lead you into a
particular

02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:38:03.910 --> 02:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
outcome i just think it's important to
 
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that
 
02:38:08.309 --> 02:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
the list could get long if we start
 
02:38:10.950 --> 02:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
considering each change
 
02:38:12.309 --> 02:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm happy to answer any
 
02:38:12.319 --> 02:38:16.150 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm happy to answer any
questions

02:38:16.150 --> 02:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative schomburg followed
 
02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
by representative romney and alby
 
02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh in reading the fiscal note 22-2990
 
02:38:33.910 --> 02:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh i noticed in page one
 
02:38:37.030 --> 02:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
that you used the statement that diary
 
02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
queried all ty 2019 taxpayers that
 
02:38:43.349 --> 02:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
utilize an nold and on page three used
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:38:46.230 --> 02:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
first one was on double apportionment
 
02:38:49.190 --> 02:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
the second one was on the 80 percent
 
02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
of taxable income
 
02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:52.469 align:start position:0%
of taxable income
in

02:38:52.469 --> 02:38:52.479 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
doing this query did you
 
02:38:55.830 --> 02:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
did the
 
02:38:55.840 --> 02:38:58.710 align:start position:0%
did the
dra

02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:00.790 --> 02:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
have this already in their program or
 
02:39:03.110 --> 02:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
did they have to
 
02:39:05.190 --> 02:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
go back and find
 
02:39:08.230 --> 02:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
this information
 
02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
so we were able to query our taxpayer
 
02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:13.910 align:start position:0%
so we were able to query our taxpayer
data

02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:39:16.469 --> 02:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
in order to gather this information
 
02:39:18.790 --> 02:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
um but it's not something that we query
 
02:39:20.710 --> 02:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
regularly so we didn't have it regularly
 
02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
readily available but it's something
 
02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
that once we looked into it it was
 
02:39:27.349 --> 02:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
readily available follow-up question
 
02:39:27.359 --> 02:39:28.469 align:start position:0%
readily available follow-up question
follow-up

02:39:28.469 --> 02:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:39:28.479 --> 02:39:31.830 align:start position:0%
follow-up
and

02:39:31.830 --> 02:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:34.630 align:start position:0%
 
if

02:39:34.630 --> 02:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:37.030 --> 02:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
a piece of legislation comes that
 
02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
requires this kind of data and you did a
 
02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
great job on the numbers and putting it
 
02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:44.230 align:start position:0%
great job on the numbers and putting it
together

02:39:44.230 --> 02:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:46.389 --> 02:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
is the dra able to
 
02:39:49.590 --> 02:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
then develop another program to query
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
some other aspect of information that
 
02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
the ways and means committee might need
 
02:39:57.990 --> 02:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
so for example if you wanted to know
 
02:39:59.270 --> 02:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
more about
 
02:40:01.750 --> 02:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
what those taxpayers that are falling in
 
02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:02.870 align:start position:0%
what those taxpayers that are falling in
here

02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
certainly you know we could talk about
 
02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
which how we could sort of slice it in a
 
02:40:10.150 --> 02:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
way that could be helpful thank you
 
02:40:12.389 --> 02:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
director romney thank you chair thank
 
02:40:12.399 --> 02:40:13.349 align:start position:0%
director romney thank you chair thank
you

02:40:13.349 --> 02:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:40:16.150 --> 02:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
so yeah i guess going back to 2000
 
02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
whatever of 2018 maybe it was when we
 
02:40:20.469 --> 02:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
what what our strategy for conformity
 
02:40:23.190 --> 02:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
i guess we left it that that we wouldn't
 
02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
automatically conform to any of the
 
02:40:28.550 --> 02:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
federal changes
 
02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
but the dra would keep us abreast of the
 
02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:31.990 align:start position:0%
but the dra would keep us abreast of the
changes

02:40:31.990 --> 02:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
changes
 
02:40:33.750 --> 02:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
and that you would recommend to us
 
02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
changes that should occur
 
02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
every year that might make some sense to
 
02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
us is that correct
 
02:40:41.349 --> 02:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
that's right we have a statutory
 
02:40:44.710 --> 02:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
obligation to report to you yearly
 
02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:46.150 align:start position:0%
obligation to report to you yearly
by

02:40:46.150 --> 02:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
march 31st so it should be in your inbox
 
02:40:52.469 --> 02:40:52.479 align:start position:0%
somewhere um because it was sent it was
 
02:40:54.309 --> 02:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
signed and sent um
 
02:40:59.510 --> 02:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:01.670 --> 02:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
did it go up i guess
 
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
do you know if that went to the whole
 
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee or did it
 
02:41:06.870 --> 02:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
i forget representative what our
 
02:41:08.710 --> 02:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
obligation is whether it's to send it to
 
02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
the chair and vice chair or to the full
 
02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:16.469 align:start position:0%
the chair and vice chair or to the full
committee

02:41:16.469 --> 02:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
but it goes to the chair of the senate
 
02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
chair and the house chair the speak that
 
02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
that kind of a thing that's right and we
 
02:41:24.710 --> 02:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
typically send it in hard copy
 
02:41:27.590 --> 02:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
so it may be in a box somewhere
 
02:41:29.830 --> 02:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
right but that's the process
 
02:41:31.269 --> 02:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
and before this bill did you have
 
02:41:34.230 --> 02:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
opinion on on this particular change
 
02:41:36.630 --> 02:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
so what's interesting about this
 
02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:37.750 align:start position:0%
so what's interesting about this
is

02:41:37.750 --> 02:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:39.429 align:start position:0%
is
um

02:41:39.429 --> 02:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
this should have been something that we
 
02:41:46.230 --> 02:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
talked about as a component of
 
02:41:49.990 --> 02:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
conforming to the 2018 code so i think
 
02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
two budgets ago we had a pretty
 
02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:53.590 align:start position:0%
two budgets ago we had a pretty
substantial

02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
02:41:55.510 --> 02:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether or not to
 
02:41:58.790 --> 02:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
conform to the 2018 code which contained
 
02:42:00.870 --> 02:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
all of the provisions of the tax cuts
 
02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
because

02:42:05.590 --> 02:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
and we did we did in fact update that
 
02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:09.030 align:start position:0%
and we did we did in fact update that
reference

02:42:09.030 --> 02:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
reference
 
02:42:12.550 --> 02:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
we didn't talk about this because of its
 
02:42:15.110 --> 02:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
specific reference
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
relative to nols so we essentially
 
02:42:21.429 --> 02:42:21.439 align:start position:0%
automatically decoupled from that
 
02:42:21.439 --> 02:42:22.550 align:start position:0%
automatically decoupled from that
provision

02:42:22.550 --> 02:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:42:25.269 --> 02:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
absent a decision to strike the
 
02:42:25.279 --> 02:42:26.469 align:start position:0%
absent a decision to strike the
reference

02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
reference
 
02:42:29.630 --> 02:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
to the code of
 
02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
1996 or 1997 1996.
 
02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:34.630 align:start position:0%
1996 or 1997 1996.
um

02:42:34.630 --> 02:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:36.469 --> 02:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
so we really should have talked about it
 
02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
back in 2018 and didn't
 
02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
um and so i think that's one of the
 
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
02:42:46.309 --> 02:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
it was added to this bill because it it
 
02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
felt like a miss essentially
 
02:42:50.790 --> 02:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
as a component of that conversation all
 
02:42:52.230 --> 02:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
right so now we're catching up and going
 
02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
to have the conversation thank you
 
02:42:55.040 --> 02:42:58.070 align:start position:0%
to have the conversation thank you
representative

02:42:58.070 --> 02:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:01.030 --> 02:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you unfortunately the conversation
 
02:43:02.950 --> 02:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
isn't going to have very much time to
 
02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:04.870 align:start position:0%
isn't going to have very much time to
happen

02:43:04.870 --> 02:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:43:06.389 --> 02:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:43:06.399 --> 02:43:07.269 align:start position:0%
right now
but

02:43:07.269 --> 02:43:07.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
i was wondering you're you say
 
02:43:14.070 --> 02:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh this taxpayer data that you queried
 
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
haven't you just started putting
 
02:43:18.630 --> 02:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
information into rims
 
02:43:20.790 --> 02:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
so as part of the rims project we
 
02:43:24.309 --> 02:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
carried over i believe 10 years
 
02:43:27.269 --> 02:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
of um older data
 
02:43:28.389 --> 02:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
so we're not
 
02:43:30.389 --> 02:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
we're not completely barred from using
 
02:43:33.269 --> 02:43:33.279 align:start position:0%
old data it's now sitting in our new
 
02:43:35.269 --> 02:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
system and that's necessary for a number
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
of reasons i mean our audit cycle
 
02:43:41.510 --> 02:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
is often three years behind as well so
 
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
there are many reasons we had to do that
 
02:43:46.630 --> 02:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
so we have 10 years of data in the rim
 
02:43:50.790 --> 02:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
system i believe it's 10 yes wow
 
02:43:51.830 --> 02:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:00.469 --> 02:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
what levels of taxpayer are
 
02:44:04.469 --> 02:44:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:07.190 --> 02:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
i can i can think through how we might
 
02:44:10.790 --> 02:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
might carve that up for you um
 
02:44:11.830 --> 02:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:17.990 --> 02:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
second change the 80
 
02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
of taxable income
 
02:44:20.319 --> 02:44:21.910 align:start position:0%
of taxable income
limitation

02:44:21.910 --> 02:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
limitation
 
02:44:24.070 --> 02:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
that undoubtedly
 
02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:26.070 align:start position:0%
that undoubtedly
impacts

02:44:26.070 --> 02:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
large taxpayer to small taxpayer every
 
02:44:31.349 --> 02:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
demographic of taxpayer can generate a
 
02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
loss and i think
 
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
the because what you know about our
 
02:44:39.349 --> 02:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayer base and that the vast majority
 
02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
of our taxes are paid by a very small
 
02:44:46.150 --> 02:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
number of larger taxpayers
 
02:44:49.110 --> 02:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
you can infer that the impact of this
 
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is similarly
 
02:44:53.510 --> 02:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
sort of distributed
 
02:44:56.309 --> 02:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
but i do think to representative
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
schomburg's point we could perhaps slice
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
the data in such a way to sort of
 
02:45:03.670 --> 02:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
confirm or deny that that theory and i
 
02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
can take a look at that
 
02:45:08.469 --> 02:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
but for the first change you can't
 
02:45:10.870 --> 02:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
well for the first change i think the
 
02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
testimony that you heard is
 
02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:15.990 align:start position:0%
testimony that you heard is
probably

02:45:15.990 --> 02:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
what we would find in the data
 
02:45:19.990 --> 02:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:45:23.110 --> 02:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of businesses that are
 
02:45:29.110 --> 02:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
small that a portion and you have a lot
 
02:45:31.429 --> 02:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
of businesses that are big that
 
02:45:34.710 --> 02:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
apportion but undoubtedly the fiscal
 
02:45:36.550 --> 02:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
impact of this bill
 
02:45:38.950 --> 02:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
lives with the larger businesses because
 
02:45:45.190 --> 02:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:48.070 --> 02:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you questions
 
02:45:49.590 --> 02:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:45:51.190 --> 02:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
trying to read through this and as i
 
02:45:53.190 --> 02:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
read through this bill like i have
 
02:45:54.870 --> 02:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
basically two kind of questions
 
02:45:54.880 --> 02:45:55.830 align:start position:0%
basically two kind of questions
lines

02:45:55.830 --> 02:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
lines
 
02:45:57.510 --> 02:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
15 through
 
02:45:59.830 --> 02:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
22 do they even apply anymore
 
02:46:01.429 --> 02:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
considering we're beyond the 10-year
 
02:46:03.269 --> 02:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
period of time and that's just language
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
we're carrying over that is irrelevant
 
02:46:08.830 --> 02:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
that would be correct follow-up message
 
02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up so we're really we're sitting
 
02:46:13.269 --> 02:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
on a 10 million dollar cap basically
 
02:46:14.550 --> 02:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
02:46:16.710 --> 02:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
and we have a 10 year cycle in which
 
02:46:19.590 --> 02:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
that 10 year that 10 million cap
 
02:46:20.950 --> 02:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
the federal government as i understand
 
02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
the language has unlimited cap for for
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
that what would be the impact if we were
 
02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
just to remove the 10-year cap leaving
 
02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
the 10 million dollar i'm a 10-year
 
02:46:32.550 --> 02:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
carry forward and just let them carry it
 
02:46:33.510 --> 02:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
out until they
 
02:46:36.070 --> 02:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
got 100 of their loss or 10 million
 
02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:37.190 align:start position:0%
got 100 of their loss or 10 million
dollars

02:46:37.190 --> 02:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
so it's it's really
 
02:46:42.469 --> 02:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
a difficult question to answer
 
02:46:42.479 --> 02:46:44.710 align:start position:0%
a difficult question to answer
because

02:46:44.710 --> 02:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:46:47.910 --> 02:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
even if you looked at a given tax year
 
02:46:50.830 --> 02:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
and said you know taxpayer a
 
02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:52.469 align:start position:0%
and said you know taxpayer a
has

02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:46:54.790 --> 02:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
200 million dollars in nol that they're
 
02:46:56.550 --> 02:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
going to carry forward
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
the state would never recognize a loss
 
02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
unless that taxpayer had a future
 
02:47:03.429 --> 02:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
liability to offset and we don't know
 
02:47:05.750 --> 02:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
that today you know their business could
 
02:47:07.830 --> 02:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
be incredibly successful
 
02:47:10.230 --> 02:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
and they could use up all that loss they
 
02:47:12.550 --> 02:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
could go out of business tomorrow and
 
02:47:14.950 --> 02:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
never utilize that loss so i would
 
02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
hesitate to even say we could come up
 
02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
with an impact because it's so dependent
 
02:47:22.550 --> 02:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
on future taxpayer behavior that it
 
02:47:25.269 --> 02:47:25.279 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly would be wrong
 
02:47:28.309 --> 02:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
that being said i think the risk
 
02:47:30.389 --> 02:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
is that because
 
02:47:33.349 --> 02:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
so few of our taxpayers pay the vast
 
02:47:35.510 --> 02:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
majority of our taxes
 
02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:36.630 align:start position:0%
majority of our taxes
that

02:47:36.630 --> 02:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:47:39.030 --> 02:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
the implementation of removing either
 
02:47:41.190 --> 02:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
the 10 million dollar cap or the 10-year
 
02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
carry forward
 
02:47:46.150 --> 02:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
if it had a positive outcome for one of
 
02:47:49.349 --> 02:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
our single largest taxpayers it could
 
02:47:52.230 --> 02:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
effectuate a meaningful swing so i don't
 
02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
know that it's so much the cumulative
 
02:47:58.309 --> 02:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
impact of that change but probably more
 
02:48:00.630 --> 02:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
the micro level impact for some of our
 
02:48:05.269 --> 02:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:08.710 --> 02:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
i guess that is thank you thank you
 
02:48:11.349 --> 02:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:48:12.790 --> 02:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
this is a question for the chair are we
 
02:48:14.070 --> 02:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
going to have a work session on this
 
02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:15.110 align:start position:0%
going to have a work session on this
bill

02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:29.429 --> 02:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to go back to
 
02:48:31.510 --> 02:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
something that
 
02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
miss patali told us about
 
02:48:36.550 --> 02:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
as i understood it she was saying that
 
02:48:39.510 --> 02:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
these were things that we have decoupled
 
02:48:41.429 --> 02:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
from that if we
 
02:48:41.439 --> 02:48:42.870 align:start position:0%
from that if we
recoupled

02:48:42.870 --> 02:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
recoupled
 
02:48:46.630 --> 02:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
on we would get somewhat more revenue
 
02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:47.590 align:start position:0%
on we would get somewhat more revenue
and

02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:48.990 align:start position:0%
and
on

02:48:48.990 --> 02:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
163 j is interest expense
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
which apparently we are allowing
 
02:48:57.830 --> 02:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
completely in other places or not i
 
02:49:00.550 --> 02:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
think she corrected herself after oh i
 
02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure which one she was correcting
 
02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's both of them all of them
 
02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:07.910 align:start position:0%
i think it's both of them all of them
okay

02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:12.469 --> 02:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:17.990 --> 02:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:19.429 --> 02:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:49:21.910 --> 02:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
and i i will be scheduling
 
02:49:24.469 --> 02:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
a work session on this bill next week
 
02:49:28.469 --> 02:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:36.870 --> 02:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to testify for or
 
02:49:42.469 --> 02:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:45.590 --> 02:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
i mean senate bill 4 35
 
02:49:47.030 --> 02:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
long morning
 
02:49:49.190 --> 02:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
then i'm closing the public hearing on
 
02:49:54.230 --> 02:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:56.309 --> 02:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh committee
 
02:49:58.870 --> 02:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
don't go away i have one more item to
 
02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:23.030 --> 02:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay you've all been given a
 
02:50:25.670 --> 02:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
side by side on senate bill on house
 
02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
bill 355
 
02:50:30.630 --> 02:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that
 
02:50:34.150 --> 02:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
is the senate amended 355
 
02:50:36.550 --> 02:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
and we have to either concur
 
02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:37.990 align:start position:0%
and we have to either concur
non-concur

02:50:37.990 --> 02:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
non-concur
 
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
or non-concur and form a committee
 
02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:41.349 align:start position:0%
or non-concur and form a committee
conference

02:50:41.349 --> 02:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
conference
 
02:50:43.590 --> 02:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to have you take a look at
 
02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:45.030 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to have you take a look at
this

02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
and come up with your recommendation
 
02:50:50.630 --> 02:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
so when we meet next tuesday we'll
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully be able to put this to bed
 
02:50:55.349 --> 02:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative herody
 
02:50:57.990 --> 02:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair look my question is
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
why did the senate do this
 
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
side by side's nice but
 
02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
can we get a little
 
02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
context to it
 
02:51:08.309 --> 02:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
as to why they went
 
02:51:11.750 --> 02:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
directly against what we did
 
02:51:14.309 --> 02:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
i i don't know that answer represent
 
02:51:14.319 --> 02:51:15.349 align:start position:0%
i i don't know that answer represent
line

02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:51:18.389 --> 02:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
so uh this is my bill and this is i i
 
02:51:20.950 --> 02:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
sat in on a senate hearing
 
02:51:23.510 --> 02:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
again the senate wanted to leave it
 
02:51:25.110 --> 02:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
they felt it was a business decision not
 
02:51:26.630 --> 02:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
a state decision
 
02:51:28.870 --> 02:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh in in allowing the business to choose
 
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not they uh
 
02:51:32.550 --> 02:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to have a screen they didn't feel
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
the state should mandate it and let it
 
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
let it be the option in places where it
 
02:51:37.510 --> 02:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
works let them do it where places it
 
02:51:39.990 --> 02:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't then they don't and and not make
 
02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
it a mandated state
 
02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
function so to speak
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
and that's my understanding too
 
02:51:49.269 --> 02:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
but we'll make that decision next
 
02:51:49.279 --> 02:51:52.870 align:start position:0%
but we'll make that decision next
tuesday

02:51:52.870 --> 02:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:58.230 --> 02:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:58.240 --> 02:51:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
then

02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:52:01.990 --> 02:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
thanks for being tentative and i
 
02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
actually we got out of here quicker than
 
02:52:05.910 --> 02:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
i thought we would
 
02:52:39.830 --> 02:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:39.840 --> 02:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
you
