I am not the sponsor nor co-sponsor on
 
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
this bill I am simply here because I see
 
00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 align:start position:0%
that our colleague is not here this
 
00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.470 align:start position:0%
that our colleague is not here this
morning

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
so I believe we will leave it up to
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
anybody that is here to testify to
 
00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
Pamela kylig I am the public policy
 
00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
specialist at the New Hampshire
 
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
Coalition against Domestic and Sexual
 
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
Violence which represents our 12
 
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
community-based crisis centers in the
 
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
state I'm here today to provide
 
00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
testimony on HB 143 which would allow a
 
00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 align:start position:0%
person to make a recording without the
 
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
consent of another person being recorded
 
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
testify today I just wanted to speak
 
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
this morning because the Coalition while
 
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
it supports the intent of this
 
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
legislation does share some concerns
 
00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
regarding potential unintended
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
consequences that this bill could have
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
in domestic violence cases we really
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sponsor's intent in
 
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
creating Avenues through which victims
 
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
can better obtain evidence against their
 
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
abusers without being prosecuted for
 
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 align:start position:0%
breaking the law
 
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
however we feel that more work needs to
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
be done to ensure that this law cannot
 
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
be used against victims by their abusers
 
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
as well as ensure that such amendments
 
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
wouldn't conflict with any privacy laws
 
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
in the state or any rules of evidence in
 
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
the court so
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
um that's those are sort of the main
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have today and why we
 
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 align:start position:0%
feel that more work is needed
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
additionally I just wanted to note that
 
00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
the governor's Commission on domestic
 
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
violence sexual assault and stalking has
 
00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
been tasked to review and analyze this
 
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
very issue and we ask the committee to
 
00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 align:start position:0%
consider either retaining or killing
 
00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 align:start position:0%
this bill until the commission which
 
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
includes a wide variety of stakeholders
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
has a chance to go through their process
 
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
and making sure that all considerations
 
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
are made when putting forward a policy
 
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
like this so with that I'm happy to take
 
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
any questions and thank you for your
 
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
time this morning
 
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
thank you I I have a question could you
 
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
give the committee an example of how it
 
00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 align:start position:0%
might be used against a victim yeah
 
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
um absolutely so I think
 
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
kind of in a general sense
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
um there's not there's not a lot of
 
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
parameters here about the timing that a
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
recording is made how it's going to be
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
reviewed and authenticated
 
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
um so we're concerned that this would
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
actually allow someone to set up a
 
00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
camera and create a scenario in which
 
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
you know a 30 seconds of a of a much
 
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
longer situation could be selected to be
 
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
provided as evidence to show that me
 
00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
like for the abuser to indicate that
 
00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
maybe the victim was actually the
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
primary aggressor in those cases so
 
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
that's just one example but there's a
 
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
lot here that again while we appreciate
 
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
the intent of the legislation we're
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
worried that it could open the door for
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes
 
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question you had mentioned
 
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.070 align:start position:0%
taking my question you had mentioned
that

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
about some language that you thought
 
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
would be would be better suited for this
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
bill I'm not sure if you're prepared to
 
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
give us an example of that today do you
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
have any kind of suggestions on on that
 
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
yeah no thank you so much for your
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
question I'd be more than happy to
 
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
um uh look into that a little bit
 
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
further this is something that has been
 
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
on the radar and is something that we've
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
been talking about
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
um you know as a coalition and as
 
00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
stakeholders but have not landed on the
 
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
right way to do it other states have
 
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
moved forward with this legislation but
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think we found the perfect
 
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
balance to make sure that we're honoring
 
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
um the rights of defendants in these
 
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
cases but also ensuring that victims are
 
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh my follow-up
 
00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:53.210 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh my follow-up
question

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
um would be in the event that the
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
committee is to retain this bill which
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
is one of the suggestions that you had
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming it's safe to assume that
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
you would be willing to come and and
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
work with a committee on that yeah
 
00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
absolutely and of course we'd want to
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
confer with some of our stakeholders on
 
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
um that just to make sure again that the
 
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
language is a really strong policy and
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
um again aligned with all of those other
 
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
pieces like privacy laws and rules of
 
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.869 align:start position:0%
pieces like privacy laws and rules of
court

00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
yes thanks for taking my question Are
 
00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:27.539 align:start position:0%
there specific situations that you would
 
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that a bill like this
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
covers and other situations that you
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
feel should be excluded from coverage in
 
00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
a bill like this
 
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you so much that's a great
 
00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
um I would love to Circle back on that
 
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
and get some more information I know
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
um they're just with the I'd want to
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
just check in with a few other folks
 
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
just to make sure I wouldn't propose
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
there'll be no further questions thank
 
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.300 align:start position:0%

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
committee I don't often
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
um come to this committee for the record
 
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
my name is Marissa Chase I'm the
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
executive director for the New Hampshire
 
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
Association for justice which is these
 
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
euphemism for the Civil Plains of spa in
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have about 400 members
 
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
Statewide New Hampshire is a small state
 
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
with the collegial bar so our members
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
practice anywhere from personal injury
 
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice workers comp family
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
law and we do have some criminal defense
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
lawyers as part of our organization
 
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
however I do not Advocate on their
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
behalf just to clarify that our members
 
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
want to be a resource to any legal
 
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
questions you may have I myself am not a
 
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
lawyer so if you have a question for me
 
00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
I can't answer I can get the answer from
 
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
someone who has it I'm here in
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill today
 
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
um kind of going on what Pamela said
 
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that many of our family
 
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:07.700 align:start position:0%
law practitioners have wanted to address
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
and we've been kind of working on this
 
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:14.459 align:start position:0%
language or potential solutions for
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
frankly years along with the Coalition
 
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately it is the state of the
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
law that if a victim of domestic
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
violence records their own
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
abuse they could face prosecution and of
 
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
course I think the intent of this bill
 
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that doesn't happen
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
however I did talk to a criminal defense
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
attorney about this bill and as a
 
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
criminal defense attorney he said I
 
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
um which I think is not the intent and
 
00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
why more work needs to be done so please
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
know that this is something that lawyers
 
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
are really interested in trying to come
 
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
to a solution with it's just a really
 
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
hard needle to thread um so that's why
 
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
we would ask for more time and perhaps
 
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
the completion of the governor's
 
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.829 align:start position:0%
the completion of the governor's
commission

00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
um to try to come up with that language
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
and not have some of those unintended
 
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.430 align:start position:0%
and not have some of those unintended
consequences

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
if you know
 
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
um the current state of the law if
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
notification is provided does that then
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
make it admissible in other words if you
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
come into a room and I say to you just
 
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
for the record I want you to know that
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
this conversation is being recorded
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
you have a choice to walk out or stay
 
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
I will get a more concrete answer with
 
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
citations to case law that I'm sure I
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
have talked about that
 
00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
um my gut says that notification does
 
00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:34.730 align:start position:0%
um my gut says that notification does
not

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
equal consent
 
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.300 align:start position:0%

sorry thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:47.940 align:start position:0%

an executive session
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
um on the bill we just heard uh after
 
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
speaking with the ranking member I think
 
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:23.339 align:start position:0%
we're all in agreement that we are going
 
00:35:23.339 --> 00:35:23.990 align:start position:0%
we're all in agreement that we are going
to

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
um we're going to kill the spell put it
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
as an expedient to legislate and let the
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
governor's Council on domestic violence
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
finish its work and come back to the
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
legislature when they have a uh a bill
 
00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
that's been thoroughly vetted has anyone
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
um oh let me just open up
 
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I should probably open a hearing uh
 
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
here executive session on HP 143 is open
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
um can I get a motion please
 
00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I would make a motion that
 
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
we um in experience legislate house bill
 
00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:08.510 align:start position:0%
we um in experience legislate house bill
143.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:17.910 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Speaker I'm sorry Mr Mr chair
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:20.829 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Speaker I'm sorry Mr Mr chair
[Laughter]

00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:20.839 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
do you want it
 
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.670 align:start position:0%
do you want it
um

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh a decision to itl this bill would if
 
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
if the house goes along with it would
 
00:36:34.089 --> 00:36:34.099 align:start position:0%
effectively remove it from the calendar
 
00:36:34.099 --> 00:36:36.069 align:start position:0%
effectively remove it from the calendar
and

00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
as I understand it could also
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
potentially remove uh and the potential
 
00:36:46.849 --> 00:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
for us to introduce a similar bill in
 
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
the remainder of the session
 
00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:54.380 align:start position:0%
so my my question is is rather than
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
rather than it yelling the bill would it
 
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
make more sense
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
to try to retain the bill
 
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.870 align:start position:0%
to try to retain the bill
um

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps see what the governor's
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
commission does come up with and then
 
00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
perhaps we would have a starting point
 
00:37:10.859 --> 00:37:11.630 align:start position:0%
perhaps we would have a starting point
um

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
I'm just just throwing it out there I
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
actually I I agree in my initial uh in
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts were to retain the bill however
 
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
after speaking with the domestic
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
violence Coalition
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
um they are not the opinion that they
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
will have something by September which
 
00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
is when we'd have to file a new bill
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
anyway so I just as soon get it off our
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
plate because we'll have to deal with it
 
00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:33.980 align:start position:0%
again when we come back
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
so they don't anticipate anything being
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
there representative Bolden
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
was the motion seconded it was by
 
00:37:42.359 --> 00:37:45.410 align:start position:0%
was the motion seconded it was by
representative

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative scitec did you wish to
 
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.230 align:start position:0%
representative scitec did you wish to
speak

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm opposed to it I'm opposed I
 
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
will vote for this bill to pass I'm
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
willing to take the hand-fisted approach
 
00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
I hear these objections as dilatory I
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't think they're uh substantive uh so
 
00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:04.140 align:start position:0%
that's enough of my speech and I'm not
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
going to object to consent calendar
 
00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:08.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.020 align:start position:0%

you uh for listening to my brief remarks
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
um I was on this committee for a total
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
of eight years and went back then it was
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
called State institutions uh as criminal
 
00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:17.339 align:start position:0%
justice and Corrections I spent four
 
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
years in this room
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
I just would like to put out some of the
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
things that I found from experience
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
being on this committee
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
the first thing I found that made me
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
feel a little bit uneasy was that we
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
basically only hear from one segment of
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
the correction the criminal justice
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
community that would be uh the County
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
County Prosecutors Chief of Police
 
00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:51.380 align:start position:0%
Association law enforcement
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
that kind of uh the commissioner
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
Corrections what have you those are the
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
kind of people that testify in front of
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
this committee and valuable wonderful
 
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.630 align:start position:0%
this committee and valuable wonderful
stuff

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
what I found is
 
00:42:08.089 --> 00:42:08.099 align:start position:0%
we're missing something something is not
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
coming here to the hallowed Halls so I
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
asked the commissioner a commissioner of
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
Corrections at that time if he could
 
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
write a letter for me that I could go to
 
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
any Correctional Facility in the state
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
he did and I did I spent hours at just
 
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
every uh State institution prisons
 
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
halfway houses parole probation I rode
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
with all of those fellows spent the day
 
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
at a shift not in and out spend a whole
 
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
shift up at the prison
 
00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:47.660 align:start position:0%
I found it very very very
 
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
informative to get the point of view of
 
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
the people who are actually out there in
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
the field
 
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
when you're racing around at 120 miles
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
an hour in the state police car chasing
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
some felon a propoted felon uh you start
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
to get a different perspective of what
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
this committee really does
 
00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:11.339 align:start position:0%
the second year of my uh the second
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
session second term I should say
 
00:43:17.569 --> 00:43:17.579 align:start position:0%
I spent a lot of time in the courts and
 
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
by in the courts I don't mean sitting in
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
in the public view I meant in back in
 
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
Chambers with the judges at the time
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
when I started that I was very very much
 
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
in favor of mandatory sentences we got
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
to tell them blah blah blah after
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of time in Chambers
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
talking with Superior Court judges
 
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
juvenile judges District judges I begin
 
00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:45.260 align:start position:0%
to find out that the facts of the case
 
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
in every single case are different
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
enough that a judge is really the best
 
00:43:56.809 --> 00:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
person to determine that particular case
 
00:43:59.569 --> 00:43:59.579 align:start position:0%
I got a lot of experience with the
 
00:43:59.579 --> 00:44:00.849 align:start position:0%
I got a lot of experience with the
judicial

00:44:00.849 --> 00:44:00.859 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
departments how it operates how they
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
think what they're up against and
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
believe me judges are up against a rock
 
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:11.220 align:start position:0%
and a hard place in a lot of cases they
 
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
really are
 
00:44:15.609 --> 00:44:15.619 align:start position:0%
their hands are tied in many ways
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
so I found it very helpful in my
 
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
Endeavors here on the committee to
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
participate in that and for what it's
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
worth I would recommend that every
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
member that they can within their
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
abilities to ride with the police
 
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
go to the courts visit the jails visit
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
the prisons get a different perspective
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
of what the criminal justice element
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire is really
 
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
all about and on that I will thank you
 
00:44:50.329 --> 00:44:50.339 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman I have it for your
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%

me a great segue
 
00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
um actually I have arranged for tours at
 
00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
the prison with the commissioner I will
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
be sending you all permission slips
 
00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:08.579 align:start position:0%
later you have everyone who goes there
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
has to have a background check before
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
they let you in so it's not mandatory
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary I encourage everyone to
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
go I'm thinking about sometime probably
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
in about two weeks I can do it during
 
00:45:23.329 --> 00:45:23.339 align:start position:0%
the break if you want or if you don't
 
00:45:26.089 --> 00:45:26.099 align:start position:0%
want to we can talk about it
 
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:28.260 align:start position:0%

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
we don't want to go through all the
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
people I know here thank you over there
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
and give you a lot of good advice too
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr representative Newman very much
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
Miss Cameron could we possibly name a
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
dean of the of the criminal justice and
 
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
Public Safety Committee we very well may
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
I will take that under advisement
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
um okay this time I'm going to go ahead
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.839 --> 00:46:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my name is Dan Hines
 
00:46:58.970 --> 00:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
we're at Town of Bedford representing
 
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough District Two uh this is a
 
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
simple bill and the main intent of it is
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
to codify state law so under two
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
attempts Kia it's keeping state law but
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
basically applying state law to towns
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
and cities so under state law anyone can
 
00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
be in public without a shirt on and it
 
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
does not constitute indecent exposure
 
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
the problem is some towns and cities
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
decided they don't like that and have
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
taken upon themselves to regulate that
 
00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
in some fashion or another and so I knew
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of background New
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not what's called a home
 
00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
rule state so we're at Dillon State and
 
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
in Dillon States towns and cities they
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
derive all of their power from the state
 
00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:41.220 align:start position:0%
legislature so there's two ways that
 
00:47:43.609 --> 00:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
towns can go about enacting bills one is
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
if we have enabling legislation so for
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
example the legislature and there's a
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
chapter specifically for cities um towns
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
is a little more convoluted but
 
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
basically legislature says cities can
 
00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
make regulations affecting and then list
 
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to affect so when
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's not there towns can't do it but
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
if there is the enabling legislation and
 
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
in this case I'm not sure exactly what
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
the enabling legislation was but rather
 
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
than taking broad Strokes to our
 
00:48:14.329 --> 00:48:14.339 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation statutes I went
 
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
about this way so the other way the
 
00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
state legislature can step in is what's
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
called preemption so for example
 
00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
um if this
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
yes Firearms one example so for example
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
if the state
 
00:48:27.599 --> 00:48:28.130 align:start position:0%
if the state
um

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
Firearms I guess is the best example
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
um the state says towns cannot regulate
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
Firearms so that's a specific one the
 
00:48:37.849 --> 00:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
other one is there's I guess implicit
 
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
preemption where if the state I'm trying
 
00:48:43.809 --> 00:48:43.819 align:start position:0%
to think of uh
 
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
uh let's just say there's a state law
 
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
that says you have to be
 
00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
20 to chew gum the towns can't then come
 
00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
in and just change that because it's
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
specific enough so the this bill
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
specifically says towns and cities
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
cannot have a regulation opposing or
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
going against this the reason this is
 
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
needed is Laconia and Guilford possibly
 
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
some other towns I don't know of do
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
prohibit certain people and his females
 
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
from being in public in some form or
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
another without a shirt on and I
 
00:49:17.569 --> 00:49:17.579 align:start position:0%
litigated this in front of the New
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court unfortunately
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
lost it in a 3-2 decision we tried
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
appealing that to U.S Supreme Court they
 
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
ultimately did not accept cert in that
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
case it's rare for them to actually
 
00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:29.339 align:start position:0%
accept cases they accept roughly one
 
00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
percent of the cases that come in front
 
00:49:32.329 --> 00:49:32.339 align:start position:0%
of them and in this case they did
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
actually ask the Attorney General to
 
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
respond which they don't typically do so
 
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
and there's at least in my opinion some
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
interest from the court to hear this but
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
essentially towns have been applying
 
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
their laws regulating people wearing a
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
shirt in public in a discriminatory
 
00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.890 align:start position:0%
shirt in public in a discriminatory
fashion

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
um so that's what I'm attempting to
 
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
address and like I said it says legal
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
under state state law there hasn't been
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
any issues with it um so Hampton Beach
 
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
um regularly people are topless at the
 
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
beach so both gender Sexes
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
um there hasn't been any incited
 
00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
violence there hasn't been any issues so
 
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
essentially all this bill is doing is
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
telling towns and cities
 
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
States in charge of this issue
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
you know happy take any questions do you
 
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
have or did you email the committee I
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
believe I I didn't I usually email
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
afterwards just to kind of address
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
everything so I will email the committee
 
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
about any testimony that I write up and
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
I will attach a copy of that decision
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
for the that's what I was interested in
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
the decision and if the and in the
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court if you have the uh
 
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
attorney general's opinion uh that would
 
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
be helpful
 
00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.930 align:start position:0%
be helpful
uh

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh so I can just send you extra
 
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
things if you want to look at I'm fine
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
uh so I have yeah our petition to your
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court have the Attorney
 
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
General's responsible why the court
 
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
shouldn't hear it
 
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
um and so yes I can submit all that
 
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
documentation for you
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:56.809 --> 00:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
um questions representative scitec
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative Heinz you uh omitted
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
something in your discussion about the
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
interaction of the state and towns and
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
that's local control uh are you just uh
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
what about Canada town is this issue so
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
Monumental that we have to preempt local
 
00:51:16.619 --> 00:51:18.410 align:start position:0%
Monumental that we have to preempt local
control

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you so I personally oppose local
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
controlling leads to locals controlling
 
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
you in a certain fashion in this case
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
locals are controlling people based on
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
their sex I think that's important I
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
don't think they should be able to do
 
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
that but at the end of the day the
 
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
legislature is well within our authority
 
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:41.220 align:start position:0%
to do that by by default towns don't
 
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
have local control the legislature is
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
actually the one who has to give it to
 
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.290 align:start position:0%
actually the one who has to give it to
them

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
um and I looked at the enabling statutes
 
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they were relying on the
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
welfare one which is very broad or there
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
is basically a catch-all one they might
 
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
have been relying on that one so rather
 
00:51:59.089 --> 00:51:59.099 align:start position:0%
than removing a ton of local control
 
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
um I think this is the best way to go
 
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
about it um I think it's it's this is an
 
00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:05.099 align:start position:0%
issue that should be uniform throughout
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
the state I don't think someone is a
 
00:52:06.839 --> 00:52:08.270 align:start position:0%
the state I don't think someone is a
criminal

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
um in Hampton Beach or the other way
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
around in Laconia for conduct that is
 
00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
legal in Hampton Beach it's the exact
 
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
same conduct
 
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it's any more offensive
 
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
in one location over another
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
um so in this particular instance
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
um I think it is very appropriate to not
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
let the locals decide that issue as far
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
as Laconia goes it's my understanding
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
um that Laconia did this as a result of
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
um so Laconia has bike week it's my
 
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
understanding that in the past men were
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
harassing women to
 
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
use a nicer phrase show your breasts
 
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
um and so that's how it goes about it I
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
don't know why they didn't punish the
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
people or try to deter the people who
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
were harassing people as opposed to
 
00:52:59.089 --> 00:52:59.099 align:start position:0%
presenting people preventing people who
 
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
willingly want to just not wear a shirt
 
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm just trying to
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
understand this so if we were going to
 
00:53:17.089 --> 00:53:17.099 align:start position:0%
have house session
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
and every woman that's in the State
 
00:53:22.849 --> 00:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
House is a representative they decided
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
to come in with no bra no top and just
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
be completely topless this law would say
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
how session we apply to house rules but
 
00:53:35.329 --> 00:53:35.339 align:start position:0%
presently every woman in the state can
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
be right here in this room topless is
 
00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
legal under state law uh so as regards
 
00:53:41.569 --> 00:53:41.579 align:start position:0%
to the house session
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
um we if we're talking about the
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
chambers we do have specific house
 
00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
decorum rules I personally don't know
 
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
that we address dressed like that um I
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
remember in the past we did try to
 
00:53:52.809 --> 00:53:52.819 align:start position:0%
regulate it so
 
00:53:55.849 --> 00:53:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh I I was just house sets their own
 
00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
rules this wouldn't apply to house rules
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
but it is present under law for any
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
woman to be
 
00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:07.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted to clarify
 
00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
um of course businesses still have
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
control over what happens in their
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
location this would be something that's
 
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
in uh you know public property just like
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
the state house we have certain rules
 
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
for that any business would have their
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
rules for no shirt no shoes no service
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
kind of thing thank you uh yeah so this
 
00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
would prevent towns in cities from
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
making it criminal and I use the word
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
criminal kind of broadly so if someone's
 
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
charged it does have to be a violation
 
00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
level offense but they do get charged
 
00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:41.339 align:start position:0%
with the violation ticket they have to
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
go in front of a court all the same
 
00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
criminal rules of procedure applies this
 
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
eliminates that but to answer your
 
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
question uh yes this would not apply to
 
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
local businesses so local businesses
 
00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:53.099 align:start position:0%
still can have no shirt no shoes no
 
00:54:53.099 --> 00:54:55.190 align:start position:0%
still can have no shirt no shoes no
service

00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:54:56.569 --> 00:54:56.579 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
um so what about venues for example I
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
know at Bike Week there will be certain
 
00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
venues where they'll have certain events
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
this would not apply if the if the
 
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
person who was running the venue said
 
00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:11.339 align:start position:0%
everyone has to wear sure
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
right so assuming the venue was some
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
organization rather than a government
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
entity then yes they could set those
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
rules as I guess dress for how they want
 
00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
their patrons to be so it would only
 
00:55:25.849 --> 00:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
um state property or town property
 
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.329 align:start position:0%
um state property or town property
it

00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:32.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
this I will also include the copies or
 
00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
the actual two ordinances in effect so
 
00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
um one of the towns was more broad than
 
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
the other um we limited it to the beach
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
and one limited to the public I forget
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
which was which doesn't really matter
 
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of an example of
 
00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
where on I guess if the town did say you
 
00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
can't do it on private property this
 
00:55:58.490 --> 00:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
would also go against that I I think one
 
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
of the towns did have it super broad
 
00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:02.220 align:start position:0%
that it would apply to my front yards I
 
00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:03.470 align:start position:0%
that it would apply to my front yards I
guess

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:56:04.609 --> 00:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
um potentially an issue there but
 
00:56:04.619 --> 00:56:05.990 align:start position:0%
um potentially an issue there but
essentially

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
um yes businesses and organizations can
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
still regulate the manner of clothing of
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
people on their property
 
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:56:17.569 --> 00:56:17.579 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:56:20.809 --> 00:56:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
um Laconia prohibits exposure do they if
 
00:56:26.329 --> 00:56:26.339 align:start position:0%
this law were passed would it prevent
 
00:56:29.569 --> 00:56:29.579 align:start position:0%
all towns and cities from making any
 
00:56:29.579 --> 00:56:31.069 align:start position:0%
all towns and cities from making any
restrictions

00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
00:56:31.079 --> 00:56:32.030 align:start position:0%
restrictions
um

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
other than the ones you said like
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
private property and and things like
 
00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
that on public property so this the
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
intent of this is specifically to
 
00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
prohibit Laconia Guilford in any other
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
town from regulate making it against the
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
law for someone to be topless in public
 
00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:50.099 align:start position:0%
um the reason being it is legal under
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
state law so I'm basically applying that
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
state law to towns and cities telling
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
them you cannot contravene state law in
 
00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
00:56:59.770 --> 00:56:59.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative sailing
 
00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm just trying to
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
understand so
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
um if the two of us were in Laconia
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
and we both were walking topless
 
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
um is the law such that I would be cited
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
by the Laconia police and you would not
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
be or would we both be eligible to be
 
00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:20.220 align:start position:0%
subjected to the same law so I'm just
 
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
trying to understand if there's Equity
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
under the law now or if this would be
 
00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
helping to make it equitable
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's no equity under law now you
 
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
could be cited I could not
 
00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
um I do believe they have a policy of
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
not taking people as someone complains
 
00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
but putting that aside um yes their law
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
is sex
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
um based um one of the town and I will
 
00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
submit the ordinances um regulates a
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
little differently I think one of the
 
00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
towns focuses on nipples where the other
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
focuses on breast but for the purpose of
 
00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
that yes they do distinguish upon a
 
00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
female breast which led to interesting
 
00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
questions of what point is uh is a girl
 
00:57:58.849 --> 00:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
child allowed to do that and the police
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
said well we use discretion then my
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
other question was well if someone had a
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
double mastectomy twitch the response
 
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
was we use their discretion so a lot of
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
discretion in this but on the face of
 
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
the law they were specifically
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
prohibiting females from displaying
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
their chest
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my follow-up so
 
00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
um and currently in those towns if a
 
00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
nursing mother for example or a nursing
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
person exposed their nipple they could
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
be cited because
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
I I'm clearly the police would have
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
their discretion but for exposing their
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
nipple to their child for the purposes
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
of nourishment
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's a specific issue I
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
don't it's my understanding they don't
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
affect that because I believe we have a
 
00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.109 align:start position:0%
affect that because I believe we have a
breast

00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
breast
 
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
um feeding statue and I did cite that in
 
00:58:46.609 --> 00:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
my brief to the court so I I do believe
 
00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
that is otherwise a dress so I don't
 
00:58:51.049 --> 00:58:51.059 align:start position:0%
think it actually
 
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
it may entail that but I think that is
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
an exception based on another state law
 
00:58:56.809 --> 00:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding Lee so are
 
00:59:02.089 --> 00:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
there being none thank you for your
 
00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:12.530 align:start position:0%
there being none thank you for your
testimony

00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
is anyone else wishing to testify on
 
00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
this bill who has not submitted a card
 
00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:18.180 align:start position:0%

00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:23.460 align:start position:0%

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:31.309 align:start position:0%
you could just come identify yourself
please

00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
representative scitec was on
 
00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:34.849 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%

unes uh yeah you you know sorry my
 
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
handwriting is uh that's not so good

00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman to give me the
 
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
chance to speak and to the committee for
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
their time and consideration thanks to
 
00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:53.339 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill who bravely
 
00:59:55.609 --> 00:59:55.619 align:start position:0%
worked across the aisle on an issue that
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
some people might consider insignificant
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
or taboo but fixes a flaw in the law
 
01:00:01.849 --> 01:00:01.859 align:start position:0%
that treats many people as second-class
 
01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:02.870 align:start position:0%
that treats many people as second-class
Citizens

01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%

my name is Jeffrey Eunice I am a

Free State Community
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
while I want to talk about the issue of
 
01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
whether the state law should override
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
local law I first want to talk about why
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
this issue is important
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
there are many practical reasons why
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
people prefer to be shirtless like to
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
swim or when it's hot or at the beach to
 
01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:34.460 align:start position:0%
paint words of support for a sports team
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
or to avoid getting clothes dirty while
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
gardening and there are more esoteric
 
01:00:41.089 --> 01:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
reasons why people shed their clothes
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
such as to feel liberated to connect
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
with nature for expression to help
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
promote body positivity or help become
 
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with their bodies but
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
there is something more Sinister about
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
government clothing mandates and bans on
 
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
women being shirtless first of all they
 
01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
are obviously discriminatory I can't
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
imagine having to be being told that I
 
01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:02.339 align:start position:0%
have to wear a shirt in a hot tub with
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
these laws the government is insinuating
 
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
that a woman's body is harmful
 
01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:09.059 align:start position:0%
especially to children it's insinuating
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
that the other reasons I gave for being
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
shirtless are unimportant relative to
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
considering women's bodies and how they
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
should be viewed primarily as dangerous
 
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
sex objects these laws infantilize women
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
by saying they need to be protected from
 
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
men and they can't make decisions for
 
01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
their own bodies and it promotes
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
unhealthy attitudes towards women and
 
01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
the human body
 
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
are we the Live Free or Die State or the
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
state that takes away women's rights
 
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
because some people are offended by the
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
human body
 
01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
furthermore there is no evidence that
 
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
simple nudity is harmful and there's
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
plenty of evidence to the contrary it's
 
01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
considered enriching in art and health
 
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
science textbooks but strangely the same
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
people are offended by the same content
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
and other contexts topless toplessness
 
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
is currently not illegal in most of New
 
01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think that the local
 
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
ordinance in the local ordinances are
 
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
relatively recent it's legal in several
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
other States neighboring Vermont doesn't
 
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
even have a state law Banning nudity at
 
01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:08.809 align:start position:0%
even have a state law Banning nudity at
all

01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
we've already experienced legalization
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
for example men had to fight for the
 
01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
right to be shirtless in the 30s there
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
is a famous picture of a police officer
 
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
on the beach measuring the length of
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
women's swimsuits and more recently in
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
1999 breastfeeding was legalized in New
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all of these incremental
 
01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
changes were initially met with moral
 
01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:30.299 align:start position:0%
alarmism but I think we can all agree
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
that these were positive changes
 
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
nudity is not really illegal because
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
it's harmful but because some people
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
feel uncomfortable by others that act
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
differently what is harmful is giving in
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
to the least tolerant people in society
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
and upholding the legal doctrine that
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
offending others by being different is a
 
01:02:49.079 --> 01:02:50.150 align:start position:0%
offending others by being different is a
crime

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
crime
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is very simple but it does two
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
things first it clarifies that
 
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
shirtlessness does not fall under the
 
01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
state's indecent exposure law
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
second it prevents local governments
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
from passing such an ordinance
 
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.339 align:start position:0%
I'd like to address one valid concern of
 
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
the bill that perhaps local government
 
01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
should make these decisions rather than
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
the state government I also prefer local
 
01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:12.740 align:start position:0%
government over broader state government
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
however protecting individual liberties
 
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
is important to individuals and the
 
01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
state alike especially in cases like
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
this related to discrimination
 
01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
the issue of wound rights to be topless
 
01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
touches on many constitutional issues
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
First Amendment expression and
 
01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
potentially even The Establishment
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
Clause equal rights and equal
 
01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
protections and even due process since
 
01:03:35.809 --> 01:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
the state and local laws are vague and
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
people can be unfairly harassed by
 
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
police enforcement there are pending
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
cases in several States and the 10th
 
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
circuit has ruled that bans were
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional while those while the
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
seventh circuit has upheld the bans uh
 
01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
Mr Heinz petitioned the Supreme Court
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
over the constitutionality of the
 
01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
Laconia ordinance and New Hampshire
 
01:03:55.609 --> 01:03:55.619 align:start position:0%
asked the U.S to let us decide the
 
01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
matter for ourselves so we should fix it
 
01:03:59.690 --> 01:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
here thank you for your time I'm happy
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
to try to answer any questions or
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
there being no questions uh thank you
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing to testify
 
01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
on this bill who has not submitted a
 
01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.430 align:start position:0%
on this bill who has not submitted a
card

01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
card
 
01:04:18.049 --> 01:04:18.059 align:start position:0%
there being none that hereby close to
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
committee will
 
01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:24.059 align:start position:0%
stand in recess until
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
12 o'clock
 
01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
if we get the feel for it we've got time
 
01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
I feel for Lithonia because they they
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
even if
 
01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:09.849 align:start position:0%
even if
it's okay

01:05:09.849 --> 01:05:09.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
so do we legislate to the lowest common
 
01:05:12.359 --> 01:05:14.690 align:start position:0%
so do we legislate to the lowest common
denominator

01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
denominator
 
01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:19.150 align:start position:0%
denominator
yes

01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
yeah that was just a faux here also just
 
01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
it being 11 30 I'm going to call the

01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
I probably do
 
01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
I I forgot my glasses again so you could
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
be anyone I don't know please introduce
 
01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:27.110 align:start position:0%
be anyone I don't know please introduce

01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
of the criminal justice committee my
 
01:33:31.610 --> 01:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
name is Laura talerski I represent
 
01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
nashua's Ward 8 and um I got a call late
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday from the prime sponsor of this
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
bill representative George Sykes
 
01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
um asking if I could introduce it in his
 
01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
place so um I hope as you can keep that
 
01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
in your lens as I go through the next
 
01:33:48.169 --> 01:33:48.179 align:start position:0%
two minutes
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
um I spent a little time brushing up on
 
01:33:51.649 --> 01:33:51.659 align:start position:0%
it um because I do remember it from the
 
01:33:54.169 --> 01:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
previous terms
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
um since 2015
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
driving without a license has been
 
01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
classified as a Class B misdemeanor the
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
bill you have in front of you hb201
 
01:34:05.450 --> 01:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
relative to changing the penalties for
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
driving without a license would revert
 
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
the statute back to how it was before
 
01:34:12.649 --> 01:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
2015 making driving without a license a
 
01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
simple violation
 
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure you are all aware of
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
violation is not considered criminal
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
however a Class B misdemeanor is
 
01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
considered a criminal offense
 
01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
I believe that with the attempts to
 
01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
reduce criminalization in our society
 
01:34:27.890 --> 01:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
for an offense as minor is driving
 
01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
without a license law enforcement can
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps respond in a more thoughtful way
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
for a one-off one-time mistake like the
 
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
situation often can be
 
01:34:39.169 --> 01:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
as you can see in the bill a subsequent
 
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
offense in a 12-month period time period
 
01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
will trigger the misdemeanor charge so
 
01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
habitual offenders will be held
 
01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:46.550 align:start position:0%
habitual offenders will be held
accountable

01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
01:34:48.169 --> 01:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor can follow someone
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
throughout their life and reverberate
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
through many situations
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
some examples could be having an impact
 
01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
on future procedures one may have with
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
the courts it can negatively impact
 
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
someone's employment as it would show up
 
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
in a criminal background check it could
 
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
affect someone's attempt to find a place
 
01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
to live a rental or getting a mortgage
 
01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
it could negatively affect someone's
 
01:35:10.850 --> 01:35:10.860 align:start position:0%
immigration status it could affect a
 
01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
Young Person's ability to get financial
 
01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:15.179 align:start position:0%
aid for college loans grants or work
 
01:35:17.209 --> 01:35:17.219 align:start position:0%
study Awards and it could affect someone
 
01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
interested in joining the military while
 
01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor can be waived it's not
 
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
automatic in a more complicated process
 
01:35:25.129 --> 01:35:25.139 align:start position:0%
must be initiated
 
01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
all of this because someone made an
 
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunate decision to drive without
 
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
being licensed of course we want
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
everyone to be licensed it's important
 
01:35:33.709 --> 01:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
for Public Safety
 
01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
however many times this situation
 
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affects our
 
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
low-income Neighbors
 
01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
who maybe are challenged to pull
 
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
together the renewal fee it affects busy
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
working families maybe single parents
 
01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:47.460 align:start position:0%
who are stretched thin between work
 
01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
child care and the expiration of their
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
license slips their mind maybe it's a
 
01:35:53.689 --> 01:35:53.699 align:start position:0%
young person who makes the unfortunate
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
decision to go for a joyride in their
 
01:35:58.010 --> 01:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
parents car and gets pulled over and
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
maybe it's someone who's unable to get a
 
01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
license but needs to get to work all
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
real possibilities but are they crimes
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
this bill by changing to a violation is
 
01:36:10.129 --> 01:36:10.139 align:start position:0%
like a first warning and if it happens
 
01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
again in 12 months forget it deals off
 
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
they get that Class B misdemeanor repeat
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
offenders should have to deal with the
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
criminal charge and the subsequent
 
01:36:20.689 --> 01:36:20.699 align:start position:0%
ramifications of that
 
01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
so I hope you can listen to any other
 
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
testimony today and consider passing
 
01:36:27.050 --> 01:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
hb201 I believe decriminalizing driving
 
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
without a license will be an important
 
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
step towards a more Equitable and
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
compassionate approach for dealing with
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
our neighbors and thank you for taking
 
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
the time and listening to my testimony
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um will you take questions
 
01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:40.189 align:start position:0%
thank you um will you take questions
sure

01:36:40.189 --> 01:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
I have a question just for the to be
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
clear for the members this does not
 
01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
apply to someone's license who has been
 
01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
suspended for some reason it's only
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
people whose license has lapsed or never
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
got one is that correct I believe so yes
 
01:36:53.689 --> 01:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
I have a couple questions first in your
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
testimony you said uh you gave examples
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
of how this could uh misdemeanor could
 
01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:07.860 align:start position:0%
haunt this student getting a loan
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
getting involved you're are you aware
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
that in two years you can get a
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor expunged in New Hampshire
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I am aware of
 
01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
that it also is a a process a
 
01:37:22.209 --> 01:37:22.219 align:start position:0%
complicated process that takes them
 
01:37:28.729 --> 01:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
the second question is this uh
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
as you can tell I'm not a fan of this
 
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
I've read that automobiles can be
 
01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
considered lethal weapons people driving
 
01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
into crowds so it sounds to me like
 
01:37:49.149 --> 01:37:49.159 align:start position:0%
we're tolerating somebody using a lethal
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
potentially legal Lethal Weapon without
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
training without a license
 
01:37:58.430 --> 01:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
and that's what occurs to me
 
01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
it is it
 
01:38:03.970 --> 01:38:03.980 align:start position:0%
the question is shouldn't we be enhanced
 
01:38:07.010 --> 01:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
increasing the penalty not decreasing
 
01:38:09.110 --> 01:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
the penalty
 
01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:11.570 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
um

01:38:11.570 --> 01:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:19.610 --> 01:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
representative Manny
 
01:38:21.290 --> 01:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question during a testimony
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that this would apply to
 
01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
people of low income people who can't
 
01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
afford to get the renewal uh those that
 
01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
may not have enough money for renewal
 
01:38:33.290 --> 01:38:33.300 align:start position:0%
isn't this separate from that it's a
 
01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:34.030 align:start position:0%
isn't this separate from that it's a
different

01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:38:37.129 --> 01:38:37.139 align:start position:0%
non-renewal or being expired is already
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
a violation this is talking specifically
 
01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:40.139 align:start position:0%
about people who have never had a
 
01:38:40.139 --> 01:38:41.030 align:start position:0%
about people who have never had a
license

01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
is that I want to just clarify those two
 
01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:45.830 align:start position:0%
is that I want to just clarify those two
I

01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:38:47.930 --> 01:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned I had a crash course
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
01:38:53.689 --> 01:38:53.699 align:start position:0%
um late last night as I was reviewing it
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
and um looking at this the part that
 
01:38:58.850 --> 01:38:58.860 align:start position:0%
does make it a a Class B misdemeanors
 
01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
the people who have not been licensed so
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
I suppose you could make the connection
 
01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
that if someone for whatever reason let
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
their license lapse for a significant
 
01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159 align:start position:0%
amount of time and then needed to go
 
01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
through the process to get relations but
 
01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:14.330 align:start position:0%

01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
for the questions thank you for your
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much I
 
01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate it hold on oh I'm sorry I
 
01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
didn't see your representative
 
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:27.350 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:29.689 --> 01:39:29.699 align:start position:0%
um I was trying to digest this bill
 
01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
myself and one of the one of the areas I
 
01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
think of confusion for me that other
 
01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
folks may also have some confusion about
 
01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
is whether or not
 
01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
um this would actually protect somebody
 
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
who just leaves their license at home
 
01:39:42.050 --> 01:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
which I think
 
01:39:44.209 --> 01:39:44.219 align:start position:0%
probably all of us have done at one
 
01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
point or another
 
01:39:49.129 --> 01:39:49.139 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the statute specifically
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
but I'm pretty sure that if you are
 
01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
pulled over without having your license
 
01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:56.699 align:start position:0%
physically in your hand you have a
 
01:39:59.209 --> 01:39:59.219 align:start position:0%
window of maybe three days I know
 
01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
someone from the DMV is here and might
 
01:40:04.610 --> 01:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
be able to confirm that um but no it is
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
someone who just physically is is not a
 
01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
licensed driver
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative Minden do you have some
 
01:40:10.850 --> 01:40:10.860 align:start position:0%
input on that
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
I do driving with this this would be
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
somebody who never had a driver's
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
license and or their license expired
 
01:40:19.729 --> 01:40:19.739 align:start position:0%
simply leaving your license at home I
 
01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
believe it's 48 hours you have to
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
present that license to the officer with
 
01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
no penalty that's a separate separate
 
01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:26.330 align:start position:0%
no penalty that's a separate separate
statute

01:40:26.330 --> 01:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:28.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
okay you're free to go thank you thank
 
01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
you very much I appreciate your time
 
01:40:41.570 --> 01:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
chair calls representative Danville
 
01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:50.290 align:start position:0%
chair calls representative Danville
hello

01:40:50.290 --> 01:40:50.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
the rest of the committee uh my name is
 
01:40:57.890 --> 01:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
Dan vayu I am a representative from
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 34 representing Amherst
 
01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:02.810 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 34 representing Amherst
um

01:41:02.810 --> 01:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
when I first found out about this bill
 
01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
one of the shocking things was to find
 
01:41:08.450 --> 01:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
out that it was a criminal offense to
 
01:41:10.129 --> 01:41:10.139 align:start position:0%
drive first time without a license
 
01:41:10.139 --> 01:41:11.030 align:start position:0%
drive first time without a license
because

01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:41:13.970 --> 01:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
you know growing up it was kind of the
 
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:17.159 align:start position:0%
a ritual of teen Rebellion to borrow
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
your parents car and take it for a
 
01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:20.689 align:start position:0%
your parents car and take it for a
joyride

01:41:20.689 --> 01:41:20.699 align:start position:0%
joyride
 
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
several friends who did that and
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
occasionally they would get caught and
 
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
they have to pay the pay the penalty and
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
it never occurred to me how serious that
 
01:41:31.610 --> 01:41:31.620 align:start position:0%
penalty could be
 
01:41:33.709 --> 01:41:33.719 align:start position:0%
for someone's life and someone's career
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
even as a young young adolescent
 
01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:38.810 align:start position:0%
even as a young young adolescent
um

01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
so to me it if you're shocked by how
 
01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
serious a penalty is it then maybe the
 
01:41:44.689 --> 01:41:44.699 align:start position:0%
crime maybe the punishment is a little
 
01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
stronger than the crime would warrant
 
01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
um I am close with someone who growing
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
up in a poor family
 
01:41:56.090 --> 01:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
um her father wasn't always around her
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
mother didn't drive so if they needed
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
something at the store she would hop in
 
01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
the car 14 years old and drive her
 
01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
so to me one of the other aspects of
 
01:42:10.010 --> 01:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
this is how hard it falls on the poor
 
01:42:11.930 --> 01:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
who don't have access to a credit card
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
where they can call an Uber who might
 
01:42:18.169 --> 01:42:18.179 align:start position:0%
not be able to find a ride on a short
 
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
notice who have to take chances
 
01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:22.250 align:start position:0%
notice who have to take chances
um

01:42:22.250 --> 01:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
so to have some flexibility to to lower
 
01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
the penalty a little bit to where it has
 
01:42:32.209 --> 01:42:32.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.850 --> 01:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
would seem reasonable to me
 
01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:36.709 align:start position:0%
would seem reasonable to me
um

01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
so in a lot of ways this is about just
 
01:42:41.810 --> 01:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
equity and fairness and making crime
 
01:42:46.129 --> 01:42:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.139 --> 01:42:47.870 align:start position:0%
 
that's

01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much all I have I'll take
 
01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a quick question in
 
01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
your in your research
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
um looking at this bill
 
01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
it strikes me as um on its face you may
 
01:43:02.689 --> 01:43:02.699 align:start position:0%
be correct that it's seems higher than
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
this but is it not correct that if an
 
01:43:07.330 --> 01:43:07.340 align:start position:0%
unlicensed operator gets in an accident
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
and someone could be seriously hurt or
 
01:43:11.689 --> 01:43:11.699 align:start position:0%
crippled for Life the insurance company
 
01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
isn't mandated to pay because the
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
operator wasn't licensed
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
in most cases
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be pulled over for
 
01:43:19.609 --> 01:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
not having a license because there's no
 
01:43:22.609 --> 01:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
way to know if if you're obviously
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
incompetent you know an in-app driver
 
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
there should be signs beyond your
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
licensure that you're unsafe and and be
 
01:43:34.129 --> 01:43:34.139 align:start position:0%
able to enforce it in other ways
 
01:43:35.689 --> 01:43:35.699 align:start position:0%
no I don't think you understood my
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
question I'll ask again if if if a say a
 
01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
15 year old 16 year old doesn't have
 
01:43:43.729 --> 01:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
their license yet hops in the car goes
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
to the store in your scenario
 
01:43:48.169 --> 01:43:48.179 align:start position:0%
hits a pedestrian or gets in an accident
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
with another vehicle and someone in the
 
01:43:52.129 --> 01:43:52.139 align:start position:0%
other vehicle at a pedestrian is
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
seriously injured perhaps for life
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
is it not true that the insurance
 
01:43:59.810 --> 01:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
company does not have to pay because the
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
operator was not licensed and not should
 
01:44:03.169 --> 01:44:03.179 align:start position:0%
not have been driving in the first place
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
thus leaving the other person who may
 
01:44:07.129 --> 01:44:07.139 align:start position:0%
also be financially challenged or poor
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
unable to afford their medical bills and
 
01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how insurance would handle
 
01:44:16.609 --> 01:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
that that's not my area but I know in
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we don't require Insurance
 
01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
to begin with so
 
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a broader discussion to be
 
01:44:24.890 --> 01:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
so okay I was just curious to know if
 
01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:28.679 align:start position:0%
you came across it while you were
 
01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
preparing thank you
 
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
um no further questions thank you for
 
01:44:38.890 --> 01:44:38.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.649 --> 01:45:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh good morning Mr
 
01:45:11.689 --> 01:45:11.699 align:start position:0%

American friend service committee and I
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
am not here as a lawyer or an expert on
 
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
insurance although I've been Gathering
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
your questions and the ones that I think
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
aren't answered by the end of this
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
hearing I I would like to gather that
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
information and respond to you in
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
writing by tomorrow morning
 
01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:34.129 align:start position:0%
writing by tomorrow morning
um

01:45:34.129 --> 01:45:34.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
I am here as part of the New Hampshire
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
immigrant rights Network and we did
 
01:45:40.609 --> 01:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
submit testimony to you via email I
 
01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:43.139 align:start position:0%
think yesterday signed by several of our
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
organizational members but I just wanted
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
to lift that testimony up for you lift
 
01:45:52.129 --> 01:45:52.139 align:start position:0%
up one or two of the key themes because
 
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
I know that you receive a great deal of
 
01:45:56.090 --> 01:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
email communication so I just didn't
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
want it lost in the busyness of the
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
um so we support hb201 that makes the
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
initial charge of driving without a
 
01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
license a violation instead of a Class B
 
01:46:11.689 --> 01:46:11.699 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor returning to the pre-2015
 
01:46:11.699 --> 01:46:13.250 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor returning to the pre-2015
status

01:46:13.250 --> 01:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
status
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
so something that was I believe serving
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire well prior to that time we
 
01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
believe that that such a change reflects
 
01:46:25.129 --> 01:46:25.139 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a balance in the uh in New
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of wanting to uphold our
 
01:46:30.169 --> 01:46:30.179 align:start position:0%
enforcement principles but also treat
 
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents fairly and not
 
01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:35.229 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents fairly and not
to

01:46:35.229 --> 01:46:35.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:38.450 --> 01:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily burden them uh we think
 
01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
that this bill has particular impact on
 
01:46:43.850 --> 01:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
low-income residents but it drew our
 
01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
attention because of what we've seen in
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
the past in the lives of immigrants in
 
01:46:50.330 --> 01:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who have filed
 
01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
applications for immigration status of
 
01:46:57.649 --> 01:46:57.659 align:start position:0%
some kind and are waiting not what was
 
01:46:59.629 --> 01:46:59.639 align:start position:0%
normal for a long time a six-month
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
period until the work authorization
 
01:47:04.010 --> 01:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
comes by which they can get a driver
 
01:47:06.590 --> 01:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
license but now because of a tremendous
 
01:47:09.169 --> 01:47:09.179 align:start position:0%
backlogger waiting more than a year and
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
a half so the Practical implications on
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
a whole family which can include uh U.S
 
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
citizen children family members is that
 
01:47:20.330 --> 01:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
trying to live life in a state without a
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of public transportation that that
 
01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
risk is more real in their lives as
 
01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:26.209 align:start position:0%
risk is more real in their lives as
people

01:47:26.209 --> 01:47:26.219 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
go to get health care or take children
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
to school Etc so while we want people
 
01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
licensed on our roads uh we're we're
 
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid that initial kind of
 
01:47:39.950 --> 01:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
situation uh hoping that someone could
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
get the warning of a violation with the
 
01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
threat of the consequence that comes
 
01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
with being a habitual offender but in
 
01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
such a way that doesn't disrupt other
 
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
aspects of their lives so I'm happy to
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
answer questions that I'm able to answer
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
or to hear more of your questions that I
 
01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
could help get the information for so
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.410 --> 01:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt
 
01:48:11.090 --> 01:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:12.770 --> 01:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
sorry about that do you see a difference
 
01:48:15.770 --> 01:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
between uh a person that just expired
 
01:48:17.330 --> 01:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
and a person that never had a license
 
01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:21.169 align:start position:0%
and a person that never had a license
ever

01:48:21.169 --> 01:48:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
um I don't know and I'm gonna look at
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
263 colon one to see what is the scope
 
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
of the current Class B misdemeanor if it
 
01:48:30.050 --> 01:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
if it applies differently in those
 
01:48:32.330 --> 01:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
scenarios but I don't know that there's
 
01:48:33.890 --> 01:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
a difference just
 
01:48:36.010 --> 01:48:36.020 align:start position:0%
just one follow-up
 
01:48:39.410 --> 01:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
so a license does what a license shows
 
01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:40.609 align:start position:0%
so a license does what a license shows
that

01:48:40.609 --> 01:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
it shows that you've proved who you are
 
01:48:46.250 --> 01:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
where you live and that you are capable
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
of abiding by the rules of the road
 
01:48:51.490 --> 01:48:51.500 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
01:48:55.330 --> 01:48:55.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:48:57.649 --> 01:48:57.659 align:start position:0%
immigrants coming and into the United
 
01:48:59.450 --> 01:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
States for the first time and want to
 
01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
drive how are they getting training if
 
01:49:03.649 --> 01:49:03.659 align:start position:0%
they have no license you know if they've
 
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:05.639 align:start position:0%
never taken a class you know how are
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
they going to know the rules of the road
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
it goes off automatically I guess
 
01:49:18.050 --> 01:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
um so plenty of immigrants come and are
 
01:49:19.810 --> 01:49:19.820 align:start position:0%
able to access a driver's license
 
01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
quickly others come and initiate a
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
process that's a long time but they
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
participate in the same processes that
 
01:49:29.890 --> 01:49:29.900 align:start position:0%
any of us would with driver training
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
passing the driver's test many of them
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
have been drivers in their own country
 
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:41.930 --> 01:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
there be no further questions thank you
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.410 --> 01:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing to testify
 
01:49:49.970 --> 01:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
on this bill who has not filled out a
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
pink card
 
01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:53.219 align:start position:0%
they're seeing none I'm going to close
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
01:49:57.970 --> 01:49:57.980 align:start position:0%
and the committee will be in recess
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
until when
 
01:50:20.090 --> 01:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:20.100 --> 01:51:06.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:48.050 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:51:48.050 --> 01:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.060 --> 01:52:04.729 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:52:04.729 --> 01:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:04.739 --> 01:52:41.169 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:52:41.169 --> 01:52:41.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:47.890 --> 01:52:47.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:55.209 align:start position:0%
 
rights

01:52:55.209 --> 01:52:55.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.209 --> 01:53:05.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.219 --> 01:53:30.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:53:30.669 --> 01:53:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:32.570 --> 01:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
I didn't know about the smoking
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.719 --> 02:01:13.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
it being 12 o'clock
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to go ahead and open the
 
02:01:18.729 --> 02:01:18.739 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
on HB 292
 
02:01:24.530 --> 02:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
nope that's not it what do we which one
 
02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
is it
 
02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:27.709 align:start position:0%
is it
291.

02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
291.
 
02:01:32.089 --> 02:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
and I'll recognize Senator Murphy
 
02:01:33.770 --> 02:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
to introduce the bill on behalf I
 
02:01:35.330 --> 02:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
believe of Representative Hayden from
 
02:01:36.770 --> 02:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
time yes sir
 
02:01:38.209 --> 02:01:38.219 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:41.089 --> 02:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
it's good to be back in front of my
 
02:01:42.109 --> 02:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the house and I want to
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
say it's very nice to see my old
 
02:01:45.649 --> 02:01:45.659 align:start position:0%
nameplate so uh still on use out there
 
02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
although as many Murphys as there are
 
02:01:48.649 --> 02:01:48.659 align:start position:0%
there's probably a huge box of them in
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
some basement compartment
 
02:01:52.729 --> 02:01:52.739 align:start position:0%
um I have a unique
 
02:01:55.129 --> 02:01:55.139 align:start position:0%
uh experience of introducing a bill I
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
didn't know existed until yesterday
 
02:01:56.639 --> 02:01:57.950 align:start position:0%
didn't know existed until yesterday
afternoon

02:01:57.950 --> 02:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
02:01:59.689 --> 02:01:59.699 align:start position:0%
representative infantine
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
called me up and said he was out of
 
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
state and asked if I can come here and
 
02:02:04.970 --> 02:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
introduce it on his behalf
 
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I've known representative infantine
 
02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
for nearly 20 years we served two terms
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
on House labor together
 
02:02:14.330 --> 02:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
and he filed this bill because an
 
02:02:16.070 --> 02:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
experience that happened to me and he
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
asked me to come here and share it with
 
02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:18.950 align:start position:0%
asked me to come here and share it with
you

02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:02:21.709 --> 02:02:21.719 align:start position:0%
I opened a restaurant in Manchester in
 
02:02:21.719 --> 02:02:23.030 align:start position:0%
I opened a restaurant in Manchester in
2007.

02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
2007.
 
02:02:28.729 --> 02:02:28.739 align:start position:0%
and from 2007 until July of 2019
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
I had zero labor audits I had zero
 
02:02:34.149 --> 02:02:34.159 align:start position:0%
issues with Liquor Commission
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
really was able to run my business
 
02:02:40.010 --> 02:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
and generally got along very well if my
 
02:02:43.250 --> 02:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
employees never had any issues
 
02:02:48.169 --> 02:02:48.179 align:start position:0%
in July of 2019 I filed for divorce
 
02:02:49.609 --> 02:02:49.619 align:start position:0%
and I wish I could say that was an
 
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
amicable separation but it was not
 
02:02:55.370 --> 02:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
that's the way it goes
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
um between July 2019 and may 2022
 
02:03:02.510 --> 02:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
I faced three State labor department
 
02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:03.709 align:start position:0%
I faced three State labor department
audits

02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
audits
 
02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
I faced two liquor investigations I
 
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
faced two federal labor department
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
audits all of those cases after
 
02:03:14.689 --> 02:03:14.699 align:start position:0%
dozens of hours boxes and boxes of
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
paperwork every copy of every canceled
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
payroll check every copy of check to the
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
Beer vendors after it was all said and
 
02:03:24.890 --> 02:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
done they were all found baseless and
 
02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:26.030 align:start position:0%
done they were all found baseless and
dismissed

02:03:26.030 --> 02:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
dismissed
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
it took a lot of my time as the owner it
 
02:03:31.129 --> 02:03:31.139 align:start position:0%
took a lot of time when the state and
 
02:03:32.930 --> 02:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
federal employees that had to spend time
 
02:03:34.850 --> 02:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
in my conference rooms looking through
 
02:03:38.169 --> 02:03:38.179 align:start position:0%
those paperwork and when I finally asked
 
02:03:43.729 --> 02:03:43.739 align:start position:0%
my ex-wife I said did you do this
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
and she said
 
02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
I might know who did it
 
02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:50.149 align:start position:0%
I might know who did it
um

02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
and it was very clear that she was the
 
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
one that was responsible for those since
 
02:03:57.169 --> 02:03:57.179 align:start position:0%
the divorce was finalized it's all gone
 
02:03:57.179 --> 02:03:58.010 align:start position:0%
the divorce was finalized it's all gone
away

02:03:58.010 --> 02:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:03:59.689 --> 02:03:59.699 align:start position:0%
it's all stopped
 
02:03:59.699 --> 02:04:02.330 align:start position:0%
it's all stopped
so

02:04:02.330 --> 02:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to tell you that story and
 
02:04:06.290 --> 02:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
Mr infantine representative infantine
 
02:04:07.970 --> 02:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
filed this bill because of that
 
02:04:10.370 --> 02:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
experience and I related to him as a
 
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
friend and and he filed the bill because
 
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
of that so
 
02:04:16.010 --> 02:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
if anybody has any questions I'm happy
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
to answer them
 
02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:18.950 align:start position:0%
to answer them
um

02:04:18.950 --> 02:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
you know I generally think it's improper
 
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
to follow legislation based on your own
 
02:04:24.770 --> 02:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
experience that's why I wouldn't file
 
02:04:26.689 --> 02:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
the bill myself but he did it without
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
telling me so
 
02:04:30.890 --> 02:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:04:33.589 --> 02:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
as you're not the sponsor but perhaps
 
02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
you can answer this question he went
 
02:04:37.850 --> 02:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
right to felony and skipped over
 
02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors do you have any
 
02:04:41.570 --> 02:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
um specific reason why we want to go
 
02:04:43.370 --> 02:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
right to felony when he brought to my
 
02:04:45.410 --> 02:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
attention yesterday he said that he felt
 
02:04:47.930 --> 02:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
this was the lowest level
 
02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:51.470 align:start position:0%
this was the lowest level
um

02:04:51.470 --> 02:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:54.169 --> 02:04:54.179 align:start position:0%
the copy in front of me sir says uh C
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
penalty Frost complaint liquor
 
02:04:59.930 --> 02:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:02.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
now we're looking the same
 
02:05:06.890 --> 02:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
the same bill no you're you're correct
 
02:05:09.050 --> 02:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
I'm reading again I actually I I spoke
 
02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:09.830 align:start position:0%
I'm reading again I actually I I spoke
to

02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:05:11.149 --> 02:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor and he had mentioned
 
02:05:13.250 --> 02:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
felony so I didn't even go back and look
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:19.129 --> 02:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
so it's it's uh eventually a fine in
 
02:05:21.770 --> 02:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
practice yeah everyone hears on criminal
 
02:05:22.850 --> 02:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
justice I'm sure you know that better
 
02:05:25.729 --> 02:05:25.739 align:start position:0%
than I yeah okay thank you Senator
 
02:05:28.490 --> 02:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
um I I'm going to um I'll probably gonna
 
02:05:30.410 --> 02:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
um recess the hearing at the end of the
 
02:05:33.050 --> 02:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
today and leave it open for the sponsor
 
02:05:34.729 --> 02:05:34.739 align:start position:0%
to uh come in because he did want to
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
address us when he gets back so um
 
02:05:40.129 --> 02:05:40.139 align:start position:0%
we'll keep it open for another day any
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:48.530 --> 02:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:52.669 --> 02:05:52.679 align:start position:0%
I guess my concern would be how would
 
02:05:56.089 --> 02:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
you demonstrate that they knowingly did
 
02:05:58.189 --> 02:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
this with that intent I think it heavily
 
02:06:00.589 --> 02:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
relies on what their intent was and so
 
02:06:03.050 --> 02:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
if you have any thoughts on how that
 
02:06:05.930 --> 02:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
would be demonstrated
 
02:06:07.970 --> 02:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
um these departments keep a record of
 
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
who files the complaints I don't believe
 
02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the first complaint that
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
would be actionable but if somebody
 
02:06:17.450 --> 02:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
calls the Department of Labor for
 
02:06:19.609 --> 02:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
example two or three times
 
02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
and make statements to that effect I
 
02:06:23.930 --> 02:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
think at some point it's pretty
 
02:06:23.940 --> 02:06:28.669 align:start position:0%
think at some point it's pretty
self-evident

02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:31.609 --> 02:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
represent Bolden
 
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:34.550 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:06:35.689 --> 02:06:35.699 align:start position:0%
um at the time that the incident
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
occurred did you
 
02:06:39.890 --> 02:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
were you unable to pursue charges to any
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:44.450 --> 02:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:06:44.460 --> 02:06:45.169 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

02:06:45.169 --> 02:06:45.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:46.490 --> 02:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
Auditors especially from the Department
 
02:06:49.609 --> 02:06:49.619 align:start position:0%
of Labor always claim that it's a random
 
02:06:51.410 --> 02:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
it's a random
 
02:06:52.970 --> 02:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
um audit
 
02:06:56.089 --> 02:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
they never come in and say it's because
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
we got a complaint from this person it's
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
when they even say it's because of a
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
complaint it's kept Anonymous to protect
 
02:07:05.089 --> 02:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
the the person who called it in
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:07:08.450 --> 02:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
based on the very small information I
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
had on any individual occurrence
 
02:07:13.970 --> 02:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
there was really no one to go after
 
02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:15.530 align:start position:0%
there was really no one to go after
um

02:07:15.530 --> 02:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
I did not suspect who it would be until
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
it got into the fourth or fifth
 
02:07:21.290 --> 02:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
complaint and that point the evidence
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
was it just it was very clear especially
 
02:07:26.450 --> 02:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
after the confrontation as far as why it
 
02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
was happening and who did it
 
02:07:28.199 --> 02:07:30.290 align:start position:0%
was happening and who did it
follow-up

02:07:30.290 --> 02:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:07:31.850 --> 02:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
thank you I think I only have one
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up question so if the identity is
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
withheld it sounds like the commission
 
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
would need to enforce this really to
 
02:07:42.290 --> 02:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
that they would that the com
 
02:07:44.510 --> 02:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
allegation of a false complaint would
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
probably need to begin with them
 
02:07:47.930 --> 02:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming because there would be
 
02:07:49.729 --> 02:07:49.739 align:start position:0%
no outside entity I'm going to ask a
 
02:07:53.149 --> 02:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
question this is just uh not well worded
 
02:07:53.159 --> 02:07:54.910 align:start position:0%
question this is just uh not well worded
um

02:07:54.910 --> 02:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:57.890 --> 02:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
so is there currently tier knowledge no
 
02:08:01.250 --> 02:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
Avenue for the commission to deal with
 
02:08:03.290 --> 02:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
false complaints
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
um since it would be their
 
02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility under this proposed RSA
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the best of
 
02:08:10.850 --> 02:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
my knowledge there's currently no Avenue
 
02:08:13.010 --> 02:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
for any um all they can do essentially
 
02:08:15.050 --> 02:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
at some point if they receive numerous
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
complaints and this is according to the
 
02:08:17.810 --> 02:08:17.820 align:start position:0%
last auditor I spoke to from the
 
02:08:19.370 --> 02:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor I was very
 
02:08:21.229 --> 02:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
frustrated as you can imagine and he
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
said look at some point if we get a lot
 
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
of complaints and it's clearly all
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
baseless we begin to take them not
 
02:08:28.609 --> 02:08:28.619 align:start position:0%
seriously and essentially
 
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
round file them but there's no Avenue as
 
02:08:35.330 --> 02:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
far as any sort of penalty resulting
 
02:08:36.950 --> 02:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
from filing false complaints within east
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
of these departments
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
now representative Bolden it's my
 
02:08:43.010 --> 02:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
understanding that this could actually
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
be enforced by any law enforcement
 
02:08:46.729 --> 02:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
agency in the state it doesn't specify
 
02:08:49.070 --> 02:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
who has to enforce it so someone could
 
02:08:51.950 --> 02:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
just go to the police and then the the
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
commission would have to provide the
 
02:08:56.689 --> 02:08:56.699 align:start position:0%
records as part of Discovery I believe
 
02:08:59.689 --> 02:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:02.810 --> 02:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:04.970 --> 02:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
and again understanding that you're not
 
02:09:07.010 --> 02:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor of the bill one of the
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
things I I um
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
that is a little concerning to me is in
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
the the third section where the bill
 
02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:16.790 align:start position:0%
the the third section where the bill
says

02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:09:19.010 --> 02:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
um false complaint to the department any
 
02:09:20.689 --> 02:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
person who knowingly makes a false
 
02:09:22.010 --> 02:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
statement or complaint to the department
 
02:09:24.530 --> 02:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of harassing or damaging
 
02:09:26.930 --> 02:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
the reputation of a business owner
 
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
she'll be guilty of a Class A
 
02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:31.189 align:start position:0%
she'll be guilty of a Class A
misdemeanor

02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
um I guess this is
 
02:09:36.290 --> 02:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
special protection that we would be
 
02:09:39.229 --> 02:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
granting to one particular group of
 
02:09:42.830 --> 02:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:46.129 --> 02:09:46.139 align:start position:0%
and I think it's something that we
 
02:09:46.139 --> 02:09:47.570 align:start position:0%
and I think it's something that we
occasionally

02:09:47.570 --> 02:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
occasionally
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
do but probably don't like to make a
 
02:09:52.729 --> 02:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
habit of doing uh
 
02:09:55.310 --> 02:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that I'm trying I
 
02:09:58.490 --> 02:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
would like to understand is
 
02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
if you can if you can better help us
 
02:10:01.020 --> 02:10:03.350 align:start position:0%
if you can if you can better help us
unders

02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
unders
 
02:10:06.290 --> 02:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
understand and maybe better quantify
 
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
the damages that were actually done to
 
02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
you by this conduct it would be helpful
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
to have a little bit more understanding
 
02:10:15.050 --> 02:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:10:16.370 --> 02:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
I understand the question and I
 
02:10:19.609 --> 02:10:19.619 align:start position:0%
appreciate it sir the um
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
in this case and I completely agree that
 
02:10:24.169 --> 02:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
it's improper generally to pick out
 
02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
certain segments of our of our citizens
 
02:10:29.209 --> 02:10:29.219 align:start position:0%
and provide them with special protection
 
02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
in this case the departments in question
 
02:10:33.770 --> 02:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
are only going to be going after
 
02:10:35.209 --> 02:10:35.219 align:start position:0%
business owners they're not going to go
 
02:10:37.609 --> 02:10:37.619 align:start position:0%
after just anybody that doesn't own a
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
business who can't
 
02:10:41.330 --> 02:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
it doesn't harm
 
02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
um to use my example it doesn't harm us
 
02:10:46.189 --> 02:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
one of my servers necessarily their
 
02:10:48.109 --> 02:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
their reputation to file a complaint
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
with the labor department it just only
 
02:10:52.490 --> 02:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
harms me as the operator
 
02:10:56.570 --> 02:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
so that's why it specifies that but as
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
far as quantifying it each one of those
 
02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
labor department and liquor department
 
02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:02.810 align:start position:0%
labor department and liquor department
audits

02:11:02.810 --> 02:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
audits
 
02:11:04.970 --> 02:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
15 to 20 hours
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
to put together the paperwork
 
02:11:11.570 --> 02:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
and box it up provide it for the uh for
 
02:11:13.550 --> 02:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
the the inspectors
 
02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:14.209 align:start position:0%
the the inspectors
um

02:11:14.209 --> 02:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
and in in my business as in any other
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
business time is money that was time I
 
02:11:21.410 --> 02:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
couldn't spend rewriting menus hiring
 
02:11:27.310 --> 02:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
did you um did you hire counsel during
 
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
any of these
 
02:11:35.089 --> 02:11:35.099 align:start position:0%
I uh had my attorney who was
 
02:11:37.129 --> 02:11:37.139 align:start position:0%
representing my interest in the action I
 
02:11:40.270 --> 02:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
spoke of and it was addressed in court
 
02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:43.139 align:start position:0%
I'm asking because what a business owner
 
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
if you know typically have to hire an
 
02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
attorney to weed through this process or
 
02:11:49.250 --> 02:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
an accountant or is there any ancillary
 
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
expenses possibly attached to one of
 
02:11:52.430 --> 02:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
these audits
 
02:11:54.530 --> 02:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh I did have to hire my accountant and
 
02:11:56.450 --> 02:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
have and specify that they needed to put
 
02:11:58.430 --> 02:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
together the accounting paper business
 
02:12:00.050 --> 02:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
owners tend to run several months behind
 
02:12:01.310 --> 02:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
in accounting and just the nature of
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
02:12:05.330 --> 02:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
um and I had to pay that person to bring
 
02:12:07.970 --> 02:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
it up to speed as of that moment and uh
 
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
for the inspector because inspectors
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
when they come in they say we want it as
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
soon as possible we'll be here next
 
02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
Tuesday please have it ready
 
02:12:16.490 --> 02:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
um it isn't as if we have weeks and
 
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
weeks to prepare
 
02:12:20.089 --> 02:12:20.099 align:start position:0%
um I would also just want to point out
 
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
that it isn't so much my time that was
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
the major concern for me it was annoying
 
02:12:26.810 --> 02:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
don't get me wrong it was frustrating
 
02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
but a lot of my frustration came from
 
02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
the fact that this state has limited
 
02:12:32.810 --> 02:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
number of employees and there are real
 
02:12:34.970 --> 02:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
problems need to be addressed and those
 
02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
state employees were instead their time
 
02:12:40.250 --> 02:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
was being wasted on my case
 
02:12:42.050 --> 02:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
all of it was baseless and all that was
 
02:12:48.649 --> 02:12:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.569 --> 02:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.310 --> 02:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
02:12:58.729 --> 02:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
um my question uh you know I've seen
 
02:13:01.490 --> 02:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
this in my own life and um you know
 
02:13:03.770 --> 02:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
people who I know
 
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
um that you know there have been false
 
02:13:07.450 --> 02:13:07.460 align:start position:0%
complaints um
 
02:13:09.890 --> 02:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
unsubstantiated complaints later proven
 
02:13:12.410 --> 02:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
unsubstantiated to on about individuals
 
02:13:15.229 --> 02:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
to another department which is to say
 
02:13:16.609 --> 02:13:16.619 align:start position:0%
the Department of Children and Family
 
02:13:16.619 --> 02:13:17.589 align:start position:0%
the Department of Children and Family
Services

02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
Services
 
02:13:20.930 --> 02:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you have children
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
um I unfortunately have been through
 
02:13:23.930 --> 02:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
that and it's it's been a tough
 
02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
situation I'm curious
 
02:13:27.410 --> 02:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
um you know in writing this bill and I
 
02:13:29.450 --> 02:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
know you didn't write it yourself
 
02:13:31.250 --> 02:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
um why something like that wasn't
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
included as this just focused on
 
02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
business and the the financial impact or
 
02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
I also faced three different dcif
 
02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
investigations all of which were
 
02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately dismissed as baseless so
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
there's this is one segment of a very
 
02:13:46.250 --> 02:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
broad frankly campaign against me
 
02:13:50.209 --> 02:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
personally as a parent and as a as a
 
02:13:52.569 --> 02:13:52.579 align:start position:0%
as an individual in our state
 
02:13:54.530 --> 02:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there's another
 
02:13:55.790 --> 02:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
bill that was followed by a different
 
02:13:57.970 --> 02:13:57.980 align:start position:0%
representative addressing the dcyf issue
 
02:14:00.050 --> 02:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to say that that get
 
02:14:01.370 --> 02:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
addressed but evidently it was an
 
02:14:03.649 --> 02:14:03.659 align:start position:0%
infantine felt that this was appropriate
 
02:14:03.659 --> 02:14:05.149 align:start position:0%
infantine felt that this was appropriate
for

02:14:05.149 --> 02:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:14:07.729 --> 02:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
these departments
 
02:14:10.010 --> 02:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
and you will have a chance to ask the
 
02:14:11.870 --> 02:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor because I am going to keep this
 
02:14:13.370 --> 02:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
in recess so
 
02:14:15.530 --> 02:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
um representative salute
 
02:14:18.050 --> 02:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
02:14:19.490 --> 02:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify so this would be
 
02:14:22.609 --> 02:14:22.619 align:start position:0%
specific to complaints made to the New
 
02:14:24.770 --> 02:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Liquor Commission
 
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
um I I just want to because I know like
 
02:14:28.609 --> 02:14:28.619 align:start position:0%
many businesses and restaurants after
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
I've been to them have made requests for
 
02:14:33.649 --> 02:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
me to post reviews and so if I were to
 
02:14:36.770 --> 02:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
say post a really negative review of a
 
02:14:38.689 --> 02:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
restaurant because
 
02:14:40.729 --> 02:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
either I had a personal Grudge or I had
 
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
a bad experience
 
02:14:44.569 --> 02:14:44.579 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make sure I understand
 
02:14:47.089 --> 02:14:47.099 align:start position:0%
that this is specifically if I'm making
 
02:14:49.990 --> 02:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
a false allegation to the
 
02:14:53.330 --> 02:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
representative the stat the bill clearly
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
says um
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
to the department to the department to
 
02:14:58.129 --> 02:14:58.139 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
02:15:00.350 --> 02:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
02:15:02.450 --> 02:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
oh yeah it will
 
02:15:06.169 --> 02:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct it wouldn't
 
02:15:12.290 --> 02:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:15.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:19.310 --> 02:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else present who wishes
 
02:15:22.970 --> 02:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
to testify who hasn't filled out a pink
 
02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:25.450 align:start position:0%
to testify who hasn't filled out a pink
card

02:15:25.450 --> 02:15:25.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:28.189 --> 02:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
okay there being none as I said earlier
 
02:15:29.810 --> 02:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
I am not going to close this hearing I'm
 
02:15:32.450 --> 02:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
going to recess it the prime sponsor
