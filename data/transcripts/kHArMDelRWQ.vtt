00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:02.879 align:start position:0%
uh list of bills to discuss this morning
 
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
uh for uh bills that are either being
 
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
were heard last week or the week before
 
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
actually welcome back Everybody by the
 
00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:12.990 align:start position:0%
actually welcome back Everybody by the
way

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
um uh we had a a a couple of bills that
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
were heard uh the last time we met and
 
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
then we had some other bills that were
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
still being worked on uh had uh various
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
amendments uh being worked on and um so
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to cover
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
those today uh the first bill that we
 
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to discuss this morning was HP
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
152 prohibiting the sale and use of
 
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
adhesive based rodent traps um who would
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
like to open the discussion on that this
 
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
morning represent Bixby good morning so
 
00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
um one of the uh so I I uh one of the
 
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
things that um we that I I got from a I
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
got a u letter from a constituent who's
 
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
Point who pointed out that one of the
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
problems with glue traps is they just
 
00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
are they're more expensive and not as
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
effective as snap traps and that this is
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
something that the general public might
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
not be very well aware of although uh
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
people who are uh professionals dealing
 
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
with uh Pest Control situations uh are
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
you have a better grasp of when you want
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
to you when you might need to use a uh
 
00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
glue trap and when you uh when a snap
 
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
trap would be more effective uh so one
 
00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
of the things that I um uh learned in
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
talking with a representative of The
 
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
Pest Control Association is that uh
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
their their General guidelines their
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
best practices uh include fairly rare
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
use of uh of glue traps there are two
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
main places where they would use them
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
one is if they have a repeating trap
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
where uh if the uh if it catches a a a
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
lot of mice then if there if the mice
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
are not immobilized inside it they tend
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
to cannibalize each other uh so what the
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
what the glue traps in that situation
 
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
would do would would be to cause them to
 
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
die sooner and not not eat each other in
 
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
the process um the uh other situation
 
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
where they would use them is if they are
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh doing a clearing out an area and they
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh where they know that they're going to
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
be when they open up the uh like
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
an area from beneath um cabinets or
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
beneath shelving and they know that
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
there are uh a lot of animal a lot of
 
00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:40.519 align:start position:0%
mice hiding under there and that the
 
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
mice are just going to go running in
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
every direction they will do a perimeter
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
of glue traps in order to catch them at
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
which point once they're once they're
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
caught that way they can be disposed of
 
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
very quickly and killed humanely uh so
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
uh those are the two main places where
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
they would use glue traps that are
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
targeted towards rodents uh and what
 
00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:05.839 align:start position:0%
this so I'm thinking that uh one thing
 
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
one way we could amend this bill would
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
be to
 
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh re retain the ability of people
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
who are doing uh professional Pest
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
Management to use glue traps because
 
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
they they do have a set set of
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
procedures where they know how to use
 
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
them but uh for someone who is just
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
going to a Home Depot and looking on the
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
shelf and saying okay do I do a SN nap
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
trap do I do a glue trap oh I don't know
 
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
the difference I'll just do a glue trap
 
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
uh if they're not on the Shelf at Home
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
Depot they'll default towards the better
 
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
option which is the snap
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
trap uh so I was thinking maybe an
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to that effect would be uh
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
would be a an improvement on the bill uh
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to see what other
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
that okay any
 
00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:56.990 align:start position:0%
that okay any
other

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
comments representative King
 
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um just a couple
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
notes I have written um that I that I
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
was thinking of when the um bill was
 
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
being heard publicly
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
um and that is that um you know snap
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
traps can be really brutal too we we
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
have a lot of mice that like to come
 
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
into the house every winter and um and
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of we kill a lot of mice
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
every winter and we always use the snap
 
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
traps um but you know usually what'll
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
happen when you you can often hear them
 
00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
where where we have them placed you can
 
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
hear them and it's like a few seconds of
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
squiggling and then they stop squiggling
 
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
but sometimes every once in a while
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
it'll it'll get them in the back or
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
something and you hear squiggling and
 
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:41.720 align:start position:0%
you say okay they'll they'll be dead in
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
a few seconds 30 seconds later any
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
second now they'll be dead I I've heard
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
I've heard M mice squiggle for 15 20
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
minutes and it's like okay time to go
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
get it and you know I I've had to put it
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
in a paper bag and then bash it with a
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
shoe so um that's pretty brutal too so
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
the the snaps aren't aren't necessarily
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
more Humane and then um the other thing
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
is uh we experimented once with the um
 
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
the so-called Humane ones which just
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
safely trap them and then you're
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to get them and take them
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
outside and uh well we forgot and uh
 
00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
months later we found a desiccated Mouse
 
00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
in there so that's not great either and
 
00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
that's our fault but I just know that um
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
even the Humane ones so-called Humane
 
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
ones if they're not if they're not
 
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
operated properly it's really not Humane
 
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
and the so-called inhumane ones the glue
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
traps if done properly I think are quite
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
Humane so a lot of it comes down to the
 
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
user um and I just think that whether
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with a so-called Humane
 
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
or inhumane one it's it's going to come
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
down to the user so if the user has
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
their head on straight they'll do it
 
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
right um so that's all I have to say
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
about that and to your point I mean you
 
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
know when you I I've been into the
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
stores recently to see uh how these uh
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
glue traps
 
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
are marketed sold whatever and it
 
00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:19.959 align:start position:0%
clearly says on the packaging not to be
 
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
used in an open
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
space to be checked you know regularly
 
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh you know you're not
 
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
leaving this rat or whatever uh to to be
 
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
there for a long time and and the plain
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter is that it all comes
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
down to Consumer
 
00:13:40.199 --> 00:13:41.710 align:start position:0%
down to Consumer
education

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
um to to representative bixby's Point um
 
00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:49.990 align:start position:0%
um to to representative bixby's Point um
about

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
um maybe not allowing these to be sold
 
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
to the public and then just have
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
professionals use them
 
00:14:02.749 --> 00:14:02.759 align:start position:0%
then you know you're kind of forcing
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
people to use a professional service
 
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
when they may not have the money to do
 
00:14:09.389 --> 00:14:09.399 align:start position:0%
that some of these Professional Services
 
00:14:09.399 --> 00:14:10.430 align:start position:0%
that some of these Professional Services
are

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
expensive and
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
um I think for the most part too that
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
you know people people are looking for
 
00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
non-chemical means to
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
control pests and I I
 
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
just for me I I just think that um you
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
you know we we need
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
to educate the public on how to properly
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
use them if they're going to use them I
 
00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:39.399 align:start position:0%
mean I think we just
 
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
rodents are a problem they carry
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
diseases and if we have a non-chemical
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
means to control them and I know that
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
there are many non-chemical means to to
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
control them but why would we want to
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
remove a non-chemical means when we're
 
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
also looking at removing chemical means
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
I mean it it why would we want to keep
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
limiting our choices and I just think
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
that um it's it's just not something
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
that we can we can easily make an an
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
amendment that would be uh something
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
and and to be honest I think that a lot
 
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
more people now are being educated and
 
00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:37.959 align:start position:0%
are not buying these glue traps I know
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
personally I wouldn't buy one I wouldn't
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
um but there are a lot of people who
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
want to have that choice and I think
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
that uh you know the more we educate
 
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
people in the public to make sensible
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
choices and let the market decide
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
whether these things should be sold or
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
not if they're not if they're not
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
popular and they're not being sold
 
00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
manufacturers won't make them
 
00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:05.110 align:start position:0%
manufacturers won't make them
representative

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
Barber thank you um my stumbling block
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
on this was the idea that you can buy
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
these on the internet I know that the
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
bill states that they cannot be shipped
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
into the state but that's an Enforcement
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
issue that I would find very difficult
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
to follow through on um records would
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
have to be kept um so for me me that
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
that was the biggest issue was that we
 
00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
can't actually prevent them from coming
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
into the state um and for people to buy
 
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
them you know and be using them so I
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a an answer to
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
that um but that is a a big stumbling
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
block for
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
me representative Miner and then
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you madam
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
chairman I think much like uh there
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
isn't a kind of gentler machine gun
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
there isn't a kind of gentler rodent
 
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
trap um I think we I think we can put
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
this to bed by letting um the
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
professionals decide what is what is
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
right for them to use in these
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
situations it's I don't think it's for
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
us to
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
decide represent H
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
Haskins with respect we make a lot of
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
such decisions and for me it's a
 
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.789 align:start position:0%
such decisions and for me it's a
conscience

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.079 align:start position:0%
issue I believe what makes us human is
 
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%
that we are at we are able as sentient
 
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
beings to put ourselves in the place of
 
00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
these Critters I'm not a mouse fan I'm
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
not a rodent fan but I think these
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
methods when I hear about cannibalizing
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
each other and bashing their heads and
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
we had testimony about drowning them and
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
the woman said please don't think that
 
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's more
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
Humane we don't know what it's like to
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
drown but we wouldn't want to find out
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
so we've had this bill in the past
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
because our constitu
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
are begging us to pay attention to it
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
and that is why I was happy to bring It
 
00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
Forward I think we will
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
not make it a perfect Bill i' I'd be
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
open to an amendment but I my conscience
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
one representative jman thank you madam
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
chair uh and and I would say that while
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
it is true in the end we're talking
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
about means usually of of killing mice
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully with the the have a heart type
 
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
traps or the Humane traps you can you
 
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
can let them go but a lot of the means
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
that we use will end up killing the mice
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
so I I understand where my colleague is
 
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
coming from in terms of in the end how
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
much of this can be really Humane
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
however we did also receive an email
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
some of us did from a gentleman who was
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
testified before the committee before
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
who has a pest control company who
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
represents uh that industry and uh and
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
he is is also very interested Like Us in
 
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
not seeing this bill come back again and
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
again and again and and has said that
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
this is a means that for him ranks very
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
very low you know toward the end of the
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
list of means that he would use to deal
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
with a rodent infestation and he
 
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
supports the idea that uh it's something
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
that would not be commercially available
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
as a way to try
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
to respond to the concerns of our
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
constituents as representative H Haskins
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
pointed out that that are not going away
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
I mean none of us wanted to hear with
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
the cat declaw bill look this is just
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to keep coming back I understand
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
that but this is just going to keep
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
coming back so uh and I think that is an
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
indication of how much many of our
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
constituents want this to happen and I
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
think it's our job to work toward that
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
goal and if we can find a way to meet
 
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the middle uh we'll be
 
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
doing the jobs that they sent us here to
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
do anyone else representative Freeman
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and and it's a
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
fascinating conversation I'll give you a
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
little perspective on why I just
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
intrinsically don't believe this is a
 
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
good idea I originally from Boston if no
 
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
one can tell and I remember at a time
 
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
when they were redoing all the
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
Subways and I remember standing on a
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
platform and watching Rats the size of
 
00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
dogs Scurry through the tunnels they had
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
such a rodent problem in Boston when
 
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
they started digging that they had to
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
use every tool available in order to
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
mitigate the rodent problem did they use
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
glue traps I don't know but I am opposed
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
to any type of ban on any tool that may
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
work you in in most situations you go
 
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
from the least restrictive to the most
 
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
restrictive and I don't see glue traps
 
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
as being the first line of defense when
 
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
people are trying to combat a rod an
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
issue so I wouldn't use them I wouldn't
 
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559 align:start position:0%
use them because you know it wouldn't be
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
my preferred method of Exterminating
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
them but as a legislature and as people
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
what right do we have to limit how many
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
tools people have in the toolbox in
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
order to improve their quality of life
 
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
so I mean I'm listening to this
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
conversation and I really am in taking
 
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
all of it in but I just don't think in
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
my good conscience that I would say no
 
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
you can't use those even though you've
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
tried every other means
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
possible and and we did hear testimony
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
from um The Pest Control folks that said
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
that um these glue traps are more
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
effective than snap
 
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
traps so you know I don't know I mean we
 
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
we get a letter from somebody who said
 
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
they're not and then we have some
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
professionals in the field who say that
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
they are more effective than glue traps
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
that they they
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
so I don't know I mean but I and so far
 
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
as I'm concerned
 
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah we have a lot of people who want
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
to see this bill passed uh you know
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
we've gotten emails and everything
 
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
else they won't buy them let the market
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
decide let them tell their friends don't
 
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
buy them but why should we legislate for
 
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
people against you know to PE for people
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
not to be able to buy them if they want
 
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.029 align:start position:0%
not to be able to buy them if they want
them

00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
especially if they will you know read
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
the package and and understand not to
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
put them outside or to check them
 
00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039 align:start position:0%
frequently or whatever um I I just don't
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
see uh us taking away a tool for people
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
who want to use them represent
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
Penza um thank you madam chair um I've
 
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
spent a long time on this project uh or
 
00:22:57.549 --> 00:22:57.559 align:start position:0%
on this legislation as well reading
 
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
listening talking to a lot of people I
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
think my biggest thing with this um has
 
00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
to do with the industry so the pesticide
 
00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:10.350 align:start position:0%
to do with the industry so the pesticide
industry

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
um I would rather um every day of the
 
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0%
week and twice on Sunday that they're
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
going to use something that is not going
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
to pollute the environment
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
and that piece to me um if this could be
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
just a tool for professional
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
I'm all for it cuz I know they're not
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
going to keep them hanging out I know
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have them suffer
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
all of those arguments that we've talked
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
about which are valid but um the one
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
thing to me is the chemical piece that
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
is you know harm for uh human health and
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
other Pet Health and all of that kind of
 
00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799 align:start position:0%
stuff so um glue traps to me would be uh
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know I would I I can't have that I I
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
can't see us passing something like that
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
just because of the industry and uh and
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
the experts that are using them and I
 
00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:05.799 align:start position:0%
know that they're using them well so for
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
that reason in that reason alone to not
 
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
be able to use uh you know toxic
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
chemicals I'm all for them um you know
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
the we can't control everything and I
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
get it I mean anybody that would put
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
these outside or that buys them at you
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
know um a hardware store or Lowe's or
 
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
something like that it's crazy but I you
 
00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:27.799 align:start position:0%
know I just don't think that this
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
legislation as possible I mean we can't
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
control the internet I mean for you can
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
purchase everything any so what we said
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
a lot last time last um last term when
 
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
this bill came up is education education
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
is key and you know encouraging of
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
course you know our department to to
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
have that this information um online and
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
you know giving a pat on the back to the
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
professionals that are pretty much
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
telling folks you know how you know not
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
to use these in certain circumstances or
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
whatever and maybe leaving um you know
 
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
if you have a huge infestation you
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
should be leaving that to the
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
professionals anyway so um yeah I you
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
know I appreciate my person on the other
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
side right there in in in her heart for
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
this and and I appreciate the arguments
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
but for that reason and that reason
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
alone um I'm all chemical free so
 
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.950 align:start position:0%
alone um I'm all chemical free so
representative

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you Madame chair into
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
representative penza's Point uh my
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
concern would be if we try to even limit
 
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
this to only the professionals it's
 
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
going to mean that the average person is
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
much more likely to use pesticides and
 
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
them not being professionals they're
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
much more likely to misuse them and we
 
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
could actually inadvertently cause
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
greater contamination to the environment
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
than you know than just keeping the uh
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
allowing us to continue to use the glute
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
traps so for that reason um I
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
think I I wish we didn't have to kill
 
00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:08.919 align:start position:0%
any of God's creatures but I think um
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's necessary at times they um endanger
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
our food supply you know not just by
 
00:26:17.789 --> 00:26:17.799 align:start position:0%
eating but also by contaminating it and
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
it it's a necessary thing that we need
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
to do in order to preserve our selves
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
and the health of our children so for
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
that reason I will be voting against
 
00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:27.230 align:start position:0%
that reason I will be voting against
that

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
bill represent H Haskins thank you madam
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to remind us that
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about glue traps
 
00:26:35.679 --> 00:26:36.789 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about glue traps
versus

00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
pesticides I think you recall in my
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that there are a variety of
 
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.669 align:start position:0%
testimony that there are a variety of
mitigation

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
efforts I could repeat them if anyone
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
would like to hear them um
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
for residents homeowners to use that are
 
00:26:59.950 --> 00:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
not inhumane so I think the pesticide
 
00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
argument is not gerine to the options
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
that are available that we now know
 
00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.230 align:start position:0%
that are available that we now know
including

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
contraception obviously that doesn't
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
kill the Critter but if you had an
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
infestation it would mitigate it for
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
sure so um exclusionary techniques

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
not just glue traps or
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
you any other questions comments about
 
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.909 align:start position:0%
you any other questions comments about
this

00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
Bixby so listening to this discussion I
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to make a
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
difference uh if uh we put it in an
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
amendment or not so I think I'm not
 
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
going to go that
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
direction okay representative wheeler
 
00:27:59.509 --> 00:27:59.519 align:start position:0%
only thing I would say uh is that
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper did mention that
 
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:06.039 align:start position:0%
putting this in the in pesticide control
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement under RSA
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
430 um was the wrong place to have it be
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
under enforcement so if there was going
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
to be a floor Amendment it would
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
probably be a good idea to change where
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement was to have the legislation
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
fit better yep thank you it's a very
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
good point
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to move on to uh
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
HB 171 establishing a moratorium on the
 
00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:35.799 align:start position:0%
issuance of permits for new
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
landfills um would anybody like to open
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
conversation about HB
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
grber uh yes the um I just handed out a
 
00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:55.519 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment to that bill that uh
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
changes from a fiveyear moratorium to a
 
00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.070 align:start position:0%
changes from a fiveyear moratorium to a
three-year

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
three-year
 
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
moratorium um that's based upon
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
discussion that's that's SE to be uh a
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
mid Middle Ground among uh the different
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
length of moratorium that people thought
 
00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:10.519 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate um so I just want to make
 
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
sure you had a chance to see that
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise I did not change any other
 
00:29:21.789 --> 00:29:21.799 align:start position:0%
language okay uh representa
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you madam chair um I think
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're doing some very good work in this
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
Committee in terms of tightening up the
 
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
whole um process for citing landfills
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
and I do think it does it makes sense
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
for us to have a moratorium to allow the
 
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services to
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
basically catch up with their rules in
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
order to reflect the good work that this
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
committee has done I think three years
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
is far too long for a couple of reasons
 
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
one in effect you're tying the hands of
 
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
the next legislative session you've made
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
a decision for them and for some reason
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
reason they decided they needed to go
 
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
forward with the permit they'd actually
 
00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
in that first year they might have to
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
undo the legislation in order to allow
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
them to do that so I don't think we
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
should be tyed the hands of the next
 
00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039 align:start position:0%
legislature the other um issue I'm
 
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
concerned about is that we've got
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
another body that this bill has to go
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
through and we may be able to get it
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
passed in the house with the three-year
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
moratorium I honestly believe there
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
would be almost zero chance that a
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
three-year moratorium will pass the
 
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:30.519 align:start position:0%
Senate I think we could I'm for the
 
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
moratorium if we make this a one-year
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
moratorium with the understanding that
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
we can come back and we can put it again
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
for another year if we don't think that
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
adequate progress is being made but I
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
think it's a very easy sell uh on the
 
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
other side much easier sell on the with
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
the other body if we make that one year
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
and I think it also uh the tea leaves
 
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
are that the government the governor
 
00:30:57.149 --> 00:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
would also be in favor of that so um as
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
it stands I I would not vote for this
 
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
bill if the committee is willing to
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
shorten it to a one-year period I will
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
vote for it representative brickby yes
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um so uh just as a
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
matter of of record uh the other body
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
had does have a moratorium Bill also
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
theirs is six years uh so um the
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
one-year moratorium that is proposed is
 
00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
the governor's uh three years puts us at
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
a middle ground this is a good
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
bargaining position the exact length of
 
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
the moratorium is not going to be
 
00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:35.799 align:start position:0%
decided in this committee or in the vote
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
that we have on the floor uh in a couple
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
of weeks is going to be probably decided
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
in a committee of conference towards the
 
00:31:45.629 --> 00:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
end of the budget process so what we are
 
00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:49.240 align:start position:0%
doing now is really just setting out a
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
uh a bargaining position and what we're
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
doing is we're setting a middle ground
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
barg bargaining position uh
 
00:31:58.509 --> 00:31:58.519 align:start position:0%
so uh uh and in terms of you know
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
whether this could be Revisited in you
 
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
know whether we'd be binding a future
 
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
legislature well uh if in if in two
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
years uh it's recognized that we that
 
00:32:14.629 --> 00:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
all the work for putting into effect the
 
00:32:16.509 --> 00:32:16.519 align:start position:0%
the other bills we're working on has
 
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
taken place in Dees then the next term
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
that legislature could in fact remove
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
this you know remove the moratorium uh
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's easier to remove something
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
like a moratorium than it is to extend
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
it by a year so I think we're better off
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
by putting it at three years and that
 
00:32:39.629 --> 00:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
gives us a good baring position it is
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
amendable by a future future legislature
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh and you know we don't know what's
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
going to come out of the committee of
 
00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
conference so that's you know just being
 
00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
able to bargain is is is really the key
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
here yes representative Bixby I tend to
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
agree with that and as a person who at
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning of
 
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.950 align:start position:0%
the beginning of
this

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
year didn't want to have any moratorium
 
00:33:05.159 --> 00:33:06.789 align:start position:0%
year didn't want to have any moratorium
at

00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
all um and thinking about all of the
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
work that we have done for the bills
 
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
that we are looking at that we we have
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
done that we've passed I really do think
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
that three years makes sense uh in in
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
especially in the scheme of you know
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
we're talking six years one year we're
 
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
in the middle I think that gives this
 
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
ample time to really kind of put all of
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
the rules in place that need to be there
 
00:33:36.029 --> 00:33:36.039 align:start position:0%
and uh help us catch our Collective
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
breath and and proceed forward with um
 
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
with some really much needed changes to
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
um the way in which our policy addressed
 
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
sighting for landfills and other issues
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with solid waste so I think a
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
a three-year moratorium is
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
sensible uh and yeah it's going to be a
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
bargain a bargaining chip somewhere
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
along the line representative ger and
 
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
then representative wheeler thank you
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for those
 
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:08.599 align:start position:0%
comments to representative bixby's point
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
about this is a middle ground kind of
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
bargaining position it's a middle ground
 
00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:15.079 align:start position:0%
across the board right the governor has
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
said one year a Senate bill has it at
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
six we're at three this is also as Madam
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
chair pointed out really the culmination
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
of of a few years of work in this
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
committee and in the legislature to
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
build a really broad bipartisan
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
consensus around the need for a
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
multi-year moratorium we passed one last
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
year as well on a Voice vote and that
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
was on the on the consent calendar
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
because we had built such a coalition uh
 
00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:44.839 align:start position:0%
across the the aisles so uh I really do
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
see this not only as a bargaining
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
position it's the position of the house
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
but it also represents a lot of that
 
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
hard work to get us to a consensus
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
position that is very broad across the
 
00:34:59.710 --> 00:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I appreciate
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
everything that's been said about this
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
being a bargaining chip and just want to
 
00:35:08.829 --> 00:35:08.839 align:start position:0%
somewhat affirm and add you know we're
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
only two months into the legislative
 
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
session and for us to Cave to the senate
 
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
or the governor on our position uh falls
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
into a tradition that I think is really
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
sad for the House of Representatives as
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
of late where we don't respect our
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
constit tional power as the legislative
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
body closest to the people and we are
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
the ones who have heard for hours the
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
testimony of the people in the North
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
country and across this state who have
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
been poisoned by this industry and
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
frankly you know while I I I 100%
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate and I will vote with the
 
00:35:51.069 --> 00:35:51.079 align:start position:0%
consensus of this committee I mean me
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
personally I think this state house
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
given that the Senate has put forward a
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
six-year moratorium should put forward
 
00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
something even greater than a six-year
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
moratorium given that that's what the
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
people are asking for but I will uh
 
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
concede that I think maybe if the house
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
wants to be the middle ground here then
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
then that's okay the Senate is usually
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
the middle ground on these issues so the
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
Senate putting forward a six-year
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
moratorium to me shows that that's the
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
middle ground we could we could push
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
much farther than that but if we're not
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
going to do that then we should stand
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
strong in the consensus that we have
 
00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:26.599 align:start position:0%
here today around a threeyear moratorium
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good idea because the
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
people who have been poisoned by these
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
terrible decisions that have been made
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
by the legislature have asked us to do
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
guber yes I just wanted to point out
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
that during this committee's work uh we
 
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:44.079 align:start position:0%
did discuss the issue of concerned that
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
we would not we have plenty landfill
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
capacity in the state um and this report
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
by Dees uh I reviewed and show that we
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
have at least five years Beyond this
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
moratorium um with already permitted
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
capacity and as we know about 45% or
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
nearly half of the waste coming into the
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
state now being buried is from out of
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
state um the last thing is that uh Dees
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
requested that we uh put in some
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
language which we did put in that uh the
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
dees can continue to accept information
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
um evaluate completeness of information
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
for new landfills but not when would not
 
00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
act on it so we're not stopping the
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
process of an individual trying to
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
develop a new landfill and finally um
 
00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
this does not apply to uh expansion of
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
current permitted landfills and looking
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
at this again report from Dees the
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
extension ex new sales on currently
 
00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
permitted landfills that are meeting
 
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
environmental standards uh there's great
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity that would add easily 10 to
 
00:37:50.589 --> 00:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
20 more years of capacity for New
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as out ofate waste if
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
the state decides they want to continue
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
doing that so I don't think we're going
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
to run out of capacity so that
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
in adversity impacts our
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
industry representative Penza and then
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
oh representative
 
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair I just um I
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
had a question um representative guber
 
00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
about this amendment it um on line 23 it
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
says here effect July 1 2028 I don't
 
00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.270 align:start position:0%
says here effect July 1 2028 I don't
understand

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
that may I respond sure absolutely uh
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
that simply is that uh this bill
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
uh that has a moror expires on that date
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
so that refers to the expiration date 3
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
years from this
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
summer because it's a moratorium that's
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
that's the expiration date so section
 
00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
two is the expiration date that uh that
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
part of it expires the so the mor term
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
actually expires on July 1st
 
00:38:51.309 --> 00:38:51.319 align:start position:0%
2028 section not being shown in the
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
amendment they often times don't show
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
the whole bill they just show the so so
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
if you look at Bill you'll see section
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
two but if you look in the amendment
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
they don't show section okay yeah I
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
don't have all the versions of all the
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
original pieces but I can't support this
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
um unless it actually follows the whole
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
full year of 2028 so and and to be
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
honest the amount of work that has been
 
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
done on we passed this um unanimously
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
out of our our committee um with the
 
00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
2028 already uh it went on consent um
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
you know in a sense if we're doing the
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
same thing that we did following um you
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
know last term then it you know we
 
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
should have come to 2029 not
 
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
2028 um you know I'm willing to work
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
with the committee on this but I I'm not
 
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
willing to do um I'm not willing to do
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
July you know at this point in time I
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
just um with the amount of work that has
 
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
been put in on all sides of the aisle
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
here this isn't about stopping a project
 
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
I want that to be clear here um there is
 
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
so much stuff that needs to happen um
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know us abiding by our you know our
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
um Solid Waste hierarchy I mean we we
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
just got the composting stuff in uh you
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
know we're not us utilizing new
 
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
technologies we're like ranked 49th in
 
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
the entire country in our in our solid
 
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
way stuff um there's a lot of work that
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
can be done um at Dees uh we have people
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
right now that are um in a sense
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
polluting our our special places and and
 
00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work that needs to be
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
done and uh and the only way to do that
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
is a pause I hate the word moratorium we
 
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
we act like you know the the sky is
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
going to fall it's not going to fall we
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
are taking in Rochester
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
55% out of state waste New Hampshire
 
00:40:59.309 --> 00:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
comes first first that's all we need to
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
do is say guess what New Hampshire trash
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
comes first we do not have a problem
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
with capacity please let's just get that
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
clear I don't want to hear it again that
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's not a problem we have a problem
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
of um we have a we have a policy problem
 
00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
we have a process problem and there's a
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
lot of really really really great people
 
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
that have
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
sacrificed five six years of their lives
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
um and some that are on this committee
 
00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
that have sacrificed the last couple
 
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
years um learning living and breathing
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
this and um and and we can fix it we
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
just need some time and and uh and
 
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of wonderful councils and
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
committees and people that are that are
 
00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.829 align:start position:0%
committees and people that are that are
all

00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
in like from the opposite ends of the
 
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
spectrum like we have come together and
 
00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
and and looked at science and and time
 
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
of travel and all these types of things
 
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
to say New Hampshire is a wonderful
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
special place we can handle these things
 
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
we just need it and so I'm not I'm not
 
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
willing to sacrifice much on this and uh
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
and um and I because you know what I'm
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
not using using any more um New
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens as a bargaining chip
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
that's for sure so um I don't I don't
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
work for any special interests I work
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
for I work for the people in New
 
00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:32.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's time we get this done
 
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
so representative Bixby yeah so uh just
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of just in terms of the the way
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
that the um the drafting of this sort of
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
um Bill Works uh the the when there is
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
going to be repeal of something in the
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
future the standard way of doing it is
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
having one uh one section of the bill uh
 
00:42:58.589 --> 00:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
stating that repeal and and then um and
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
then have
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
the effective dat of that set in another
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
section so uh in the original Bill uh
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
line 18 section two repeal
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
RSA uh uh um and basically the 149 m9a
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
relative to a moratorium on issuance of
 
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.559 align:start position:0%
permits from uh New Hamshire is new
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
landfill in new new landfills in New
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is repealed so uh that is that
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
is the repeal language and then uh and
 
00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
then the timing of that is set in
 
00:43:36.549 --> 00:43:36.559 align:start position:0%
section three which is uh and what the
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
amendment does is it just moves that to
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2028 the reason it's July 1st
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
is because that is the shift of the
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and off and usually uh bills
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
are uh when the the period of uh the
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
active period of Bill is made to align
 
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
with the scho year uh so um and that and
 
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
if this bill is you know makes it um
 
00:44:07.549 --> 00:44:07.559 align:start position:0%
well if this bill is passed by both
 
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
bodies and signed by the governor before
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
July that will be a full three years of
 
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
um of duration for the for this uh it is
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
unlikely that this bill will be passed
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
in this form uh and that is the other
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
key issue we don't actually know that
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
uh we if we pass this bill through the
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
house at three years it is very unlikely
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
that what comes out at the end of the
 
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
process will be three years it may be
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
higher than that because the Senate may
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
be pushing for something higher than
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
that uh and that would be good uh but uh
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
it is this is a negotiation between two
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
houses and the governor and we can't
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
predict how it's going to come out but
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
if we don't have a strong uh
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
if we don't have a strong vote on this
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
in this committee then it's going to
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
weaken our bargaining position uh so uh
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
I think I think that uh the the
 
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
importance of making sure that we have a
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
strong approval of there being a
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
moratorium or a pause however you want
 
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
to phrase it is more important than the
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
exact detail of the number because that
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
that exact detail is going to be sorted
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
out in the future
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
representative ger or Willer were did
 
00:45:33.069 --> 00:45:33.079 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up before him why
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
don't you go first and then
 
00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
representative ger thank you madam
 
00:45:40.109 --> 00:45:40.119 align:start position:0%
chair my question I suppose is did we
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
lose votes on the 2030 or why are we
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
2028 as I understand there were members
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
here who um who felt that that was a uh
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
a more appropriate
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
number could I sure I guess my
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
be I think that there is a strong
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
majority of this committee while it may
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
not come out on the consent calendar
 
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
that would vote for 2030
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion I think that the House
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
of Representatives should stand stronger
 
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
for the position of the people which is
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
that we want a longer term moratorium
 
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
rather than a shorter one rather than
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate standing with the people on
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
this issue and the fact that the Senate
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
has a stronger bargaining chip than the
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
house on on this that makes me sad
 
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
because the house has generally been the
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
body which has been able to stand up
 
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
strongest with the position that it has
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
so again I will vote with the consensus
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
of the committee because I understand
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
the need for a bargaining chip but I 100
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
% agree with what representative Penza
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
had said
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
and yeah it's I'm having a hard time
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
using the people of the State of New
 
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a bargaining chip
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
especially if we're going to do it in
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
such a low way just for with respect to
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
everyone's vote on this Committee just
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
because we lost a couple of votes on the
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
committee the bargain I mean the when
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
we're behind closed doors bargaining
 
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
with the governor and the Senate which
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
is long down the line a number one and
 
00:47:28.589 --> 00:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
being number two when we're doing that
 
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
they know what the position of the house
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
is and because we have a long record of
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
history of those these bills going
 
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
through either on the consent calendar
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
or with a strong bipartisan majority in
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
the House of Representatives the fact
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
that it might not be on the consent
 
00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
calendar HB
 
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
171 to me isn't uh a significantly
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
weakening of our bargaining chip to to
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
make it so that I would want to move
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
forward okay I'm I'm going to add my two
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
cents here here and the fact that um I'm
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
not using any citizens in this state as
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
a bargaining chip I just think 3 years
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
personally I think three years is a more
 
00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.990 align:start position:0%
personally I think three years is a more
um

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time to put a pause
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
and for me the three years represents
 
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
how long it's going to take to get rules
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
written and put into place and I'm I'm
 
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
saying three years because I've seen
 
00:48:23.549 --> 00:48:23.559 align:start position:0%
with other
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
legislation legislation that was passed
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
in 20 22 where rules have still not been
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
written and uh that's where my my
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
problem lies in the fact that um this
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
legislature and uh the
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
agencies apparently have some difficulty
 
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
in getting rules written and getting it
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
getting things put in place and this has
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
to do um I'm I'm talking about uh some
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
of the bills that had to do with
 
00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
disaster relief uh for our
 
00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:57.030 align:start position:0%
disaster relief uh for our
municipalities

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
and uh and and and other things that
 
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
I've seen so for me this is an issue of
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
um giving us enough time or at least
 
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.270 align:start position:0%
um giving us enough time or at least
trying

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
trying
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
to put a pause in place so that we can
 
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
get the rules put in place in a proper
 
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:16.799 align:start position:0%
fashion that's why I'm I'm going with
 
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
three years and I don't think we need
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
five or six years to be honest but
 
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
representative ger thank you madam chair
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
and I and I want to say also with
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
respect to to my friends and colleagues
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
on the committee we're not using the
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
people as a bargaining chip here in fact
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is create the
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
best piece of legislation that will
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
deliver for the citizens of the state
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to do it for three
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
years so now that I that I've been on
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
the committee a little over two years
 
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
but uh yeah it's not using them as as a
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
bargaining chip it's trying to figure
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
out what the right strategy is going to
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
be to actually do what they want us to
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
do and deliver on the protections that
 
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
we need I also want to point out that
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
three years we're looking at not just
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
the the the rules that have recently
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
been written but we're looking at four
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
including the current one four
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions that we would have
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
in that three-year period we've got the
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
current one with some very good
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that we hope to get through
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
one way or another you've got 26 you've
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
got 27 and you've got 28 so with our
 
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
current session and a lot of good
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
landfill bills we have three more spring
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
sessions right that we can put in more
 
00:50:34.109 --> 00:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
legislation if we feel that it is needed
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
and uh I think that that we've built a
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
lot of momentum and I'll say the
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
difference between us and the Senate is
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
that in the Senate this is a partisan
 
00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
issue it's not a partisan issue in the
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
house and it's not a partisan issue in
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
the house because we have come together
 
00:50:50.349 --> 00:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
we've done the work we've had the hard
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
discussions and the hard discussions
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
have led us to a point where three years
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
which some of us think is not long
 
00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
enough some some of us think is too much
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
but that's why it's not a partisan issue
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
in the house and I think that our power
 
00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:04.839 align:start position:0%
comes from our unity and so I hope that
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
we can continue in that direction and
 
00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
pass something with a positive statement
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
that this is not a partisan issue in New
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if I could just respond Madam
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
chair just uh sure I just to make it
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
clear would not want to ascribe motive
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
to anybody who's done the hard work I
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
mean I've just joined this committee
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
been here for two months so I don't
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
Grant Ed I should have said that at the
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
beginning I don't know as much as
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
everyone else I'm just trying to
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
understand here as far as my position
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
was is I think a longer moratorium would
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
be better but I would never ever want to
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
say that anyone here is not doing hard
 
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
work or trying to use the people of the
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire as a bargaining
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
chip I said that I didn't want to use
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
the people of the State of New Hampshire
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
as a bargaining chip I think that chair
 
00:51:51.549 --> 00:51:51.559 align:start position:0%
Aaron representative Jama you've both
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
done very hard work and I wouldn't want
 
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
to make it seem to the camera to anyone
 
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
here that I would say otherwise I would
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
100% respect your work and that's why
 
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
I've said in both the statements that
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
I've had here at the work
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
session I will vote with whatever the
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
consensus of the committee is
 
00:52:06.839 --> 00:52:08.789 align:start position:0%
consensus of the committee is
representative

00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:08.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair um I think
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
and and just as um representative
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
wheeler stated I'm new to this committee
 
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
this is this is not this is not a
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
committee that I would typically be
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
familiar with however um when you boil
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
it all down this is how the sausage is
 
00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.309 align:start position:0%
it all down this is how the sausage is
made

00:52:27.309 --> 00:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
this is how we get things that we need
 
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
and what the people of the state need
 
00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
they've asked us to do this they've
 
00:52:37.789 --> 00:52:37.799 align:start position:0%
tasked us with this well we we don't
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
work unilaterally we have to consider
 
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and the Senate so
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
in order to get what we want we have to
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
be involved in the sausage making
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
proverbially so while this may not be
 
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
what everybody wants or the perfect
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
thing that they want it's a start and if
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
we don't start somewhere we don't end
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere so to that end I will support
 
00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:02.799 align:start position:0%
this amendment I will also support the
 
00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
bill because um I know how much work has
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
gone into this and I also know that this
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
is probably the most nonpartisan
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
Committee in the state house and I want
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
to keep it that
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
way represented Penza and then
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
Howard she was first I'm GNA give it to
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
her okay sorry I missed that thank you
 
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:29.559 align:start position:0%
my I'll be brief um I think that um the
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
only oh sorry um I think that the the
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
main reason for shortening this the time
 
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
span would be to accommodate business or
 
00:53:41.069 --> 00:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
um rather than to protect the
 
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
environment and I think that this this
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
committee is tasked with Pro protecting
 
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
the environment um and and if we don't
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
give ourselves enough time to make the
 
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
rules right and strong then we are not
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
serving the environment of in the state
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so um I would vote for
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
I for the longest time that that we can
 
00:54:02.079 --> 00:54:03.190 align:start position:0%
I for the longest time that that we can
agree

00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
upon okay represent
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
penda um thank you um thank you madam
 
00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:11.720 align:start position:0%
chair and uh thank you for that I agree
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't believe anyone in this
 
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:15.640 align:start position:0%
committee at all or in the house that
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
have been working on this are you know
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
the I I know that the word was used and
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
I think that the word was you know I
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
hate this word triggering but it was it
 
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
was triggering the bargaining chip piece
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
because um it just seems as if we always
 
00:54:32.349 --> 00:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
have to do that right we come out with a
 
00:54:34.789 --> 00:54:34.799 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and we all agree
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
and it's perfect and then okay well it
 
00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:39.319 align:start position:0%
get watered down and then it gets hit
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
and d and then it's killed and so um the
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
work that has been done is is um is
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
Stellar here and yeah there's there's no
 
00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
one um that I'd rather go to battle with
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
on all of these things than this
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
committee so that's not an issue um not
 
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
in any way shape or form so I
 
00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.109 align:start position:0%
in any way shape or form so I
[Music]

00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
um I just know how hard it is to get
 
00:55:09.789 --> 00:55:09.799 align:start position:0%
things done through um the legislature
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
and that's my only concern is
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
time um chairwoman we could definitely
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
could we could we do what we needed to
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
do and get it done in three years I
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
think we totally could um and and if
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
everybody's truly motivated and and
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
committed on that um then then I'm okay
 
00:55:32.349 --> 00:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
and like I said I'll sign on board I
 
00:55:35.029 --> 00:55:35.039 align:start position:0%
just I just know how things have kind of
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
operated um over the last five or six
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
years so that's why you know the more
 
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
time the better to me but however we
 
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
could do it I still um I still want it
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
to carry the whole year um but you know
 
00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:52.359 align:start position:0%
if this is already you know this is
 
00:55:53.549 --> 00:55:53.559 align:start position:0%
already in the works and this is
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
something that we want to get out of um
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
the committee today and get it um exact
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
then you know let's get her done okay
 
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.559 align:start position:0%
represent Scully thank you madam chair I
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
I actually had a question representative
 
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:09.640 align:start position:0%
Bixby you did say that there was a bill
 
00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
before the Senate asking for a six-year
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
moratorium uh has that
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
passed I'm going to defer to
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
representative J Man on that since he's
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
been tracking it more
 
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
closely uh no what they did is what the
 
00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
Senate does uh they've held it to see
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
may I all right all right and fair
 
00:56:34.029 --> 00:56:34.039 align:start position:0%
enough um I guess I would say though at
 
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
this point six years is not the position
 
00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:37.640 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
Senate it is not if may I sure just
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
quick I would say and I agree with that
 
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely statement of fact I would say
 
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that they didn't itl it and
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
they're holding it to me indicates that
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
they are open to some link I will it be
 
00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
six I don't know but they didn't itl it
 
00:56:58.029 --> 00:56:58.039 align:start position:0%
they're holding it because they want to
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
see where we come down all right thank
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
you representative guber uh yes thank
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
you uh Madam chair um my intention was
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
never to water down the environmental
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
value I think we need to we have passed
 
00:57:15.069 --> 00:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
some terrific uh legislation already uh
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
bills that uh are going to change things
 
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
I just want to get it done and I think
 
00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:21.559 align:start position:0%
three years uh if we're really going to
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
get it done we'll have the same output
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
as if we had five years where well we
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
don't have to do anything right now we
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
have another year I think we need to do
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
the work and get it done and um to
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
follow up the uh comment on Madam chair
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
is the the B tment is not to stop
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
creating new landfills it's to set
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
standards so that any new landfills meet
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
the environmental and uh economic needs
 
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
of the state thank you representative
 
00:57:51.069 --> 00:57:51.079 align:start position:0%
Penza I just wanted to thank you madam
 
00:57:53.029 --> 00:57:53.039 align:start position:0%
chair I just wanted to comment on the
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
Senate position um only because I spoke
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
with one of the Senators that is um uh
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
on the moratorium bill on the Senate
 
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
side so just in my time these things
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
have been originating from the house so
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
for a bill to have multiple Senators on
 
00:58:15.789 --> 00:58:15.799 align:start position:0%
it that's originating from the Senate on
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
a moratorium side is absolutely huge so
 
00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
I don't that's I think that's why uh
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby bringing that up um
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
as well as representative gerana I I we
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
can't downplay that so it's not the
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
position of the entire Senate but it's
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
the position of many members that and
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
that has not been the case in the past
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that is that's very
 
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
important to see that that body is
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
working on something that we've been
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
trying to um push through and which has
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
been kind of shut down so that's why
 
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
it's really kind of important and um you
 
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
know it's there's it's a position of a
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
lot of people people so that's good
 
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yeah um I'm just
 
00:59:02.589 --> 00:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
noticing the time here I think we've had
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
a fairly thorough discussion of um of of
 
00:59:08.109 --> 00:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
two of
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
171 oh so um so perhaps uh after we hear
 
00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:15.640 align:start position:0%
from the uh chair of the subcommittee On
 
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste maybe we can move on
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative King thank you madam
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
chair um so everybody here uh has heard
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
me speak about this before if I had my
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
DRS the moratorium would last Infinity
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
years um but um I also recognize the
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
political reality of the situation um
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill is fine with
 
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
three years I'm fine with three years I
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
really like the idea of us getting uh
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
getting this through on consent calendar
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
I'd rather it not turn into a debate on
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
the house floor uh if you ask 400 people
 
00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:53.799 align:start position:0%
how many years it can be it would be
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
messy and I'd rather it just go through
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
cleanly um and to throw one possible
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
Monkey Wrench in the in the gears not
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
intentionally but it's an honest
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
question it's not a rhetorical question
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
um I had um somebody email me a few
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
weeks ago who apparently is in the
 
01:00:16.589 --> 01:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
business somehow um and he says there is
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
a site in Berlin that is really already
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
a waste Zone it was um an area where I
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
guess construction or what other type
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
waste was just dumped there for for
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
decades and he actually wants to clean
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
it up and turn it into another landfill
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a lot better he
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to use Municipal Solid
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
Waste he doesn't want anything toxic
 
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
it's mostly going to be dirt and um and
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
wood and other sort of all natural and
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
he's concerned that this bill would
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
preclude him from being able to do like
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
a a
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
natural landfill so um I guess of the
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
nice things about a three-year
 
01:00:59.950 --> 01:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
moratorium is that he would be able to
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
interject and say Hey I want a landfill
 
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to be anything with
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
toxic materials in it or whatever um so
 
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
there there is I guess one of the
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
benefits of of reducing it down to three
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
years instead of five is that it would
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
allow somebody who has maybe let's say a
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason to build a landfill to
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully get his his prospects in with
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
the rules uh
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
situation uh and if if somebody else
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
knows more about that they're welcome to
 
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
chime in I'd like to hear it um but um
 
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
My Hope also is to just piggyback on
 
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
what chairman our chairwoman uh Erin
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
said that it can take a long time for
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
them to write rules and so for that
 
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
reason I hope representative Scully will
 
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
support a three-year moratorium and
 
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
allow this to go on consent calendar
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
because one year just is not enough for
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
the bureaucrats to write rules so um I
 
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
would really like to see this go on
 
01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
consent calendar thanks thank you okay I
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
think we can uh wrap up conversation on
 
01:02:02.029 --> 01:02:02.039 align:start position:0%
HB 171 and I hope that when uh time
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
comes to exec this bill later on that uh
 
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
we can all agree on the amendment and
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
pass it um moving along we have HB
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
251 Now for Something Completely
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
Different allowing for the ownership of
 
01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.670 align:start position:0%
 
raccoons

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
raccoons
 
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby go right ahead jump
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
in on this one so I think that um some
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
of the testimony we heard uh last week
 
01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
was pretty convincing that this would be
 
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
a really bad idea uh like the if you
 
01:02:40.269 --> 01:02:40.279 align:start position:0%
have a pet squirrel and you need to go
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere and get someone to help you
 
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
take care of it then you not only need
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
to have a lot of patience but you have
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
to have a high pain threshold uh this
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
this is that sounds really unpromising
 
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:55.240 align:start position:0%
uh I think that uh the many people who
 
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
wrote an wrote in and said squirrels and
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
raccoons should not be pets they're wild
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
animals just have it
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair when I was
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
a child there was a a book I think it
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
was even made into a movie about having
 
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
a pet um a pet raccoon and even at the
 
01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
end of that movie he had to set him free
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
because he just couldn't keep a wild
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
animal in his in in domestic situation
 
01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
so I agree with uh representative viby
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's a bad idea
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
well you know okay I'm I'm just going to
 
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
say this
 
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
um I mean I wouldn't want to have a
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
raccoon or a squirrel for a pet but
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
there are people who do and
 
01:03:40.319 --> 01:03:42.230 align:start position:0%
there are people who do and
um

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
I I'm really dismayed
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
that we have our fish and game
 
01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
department spend time and money in
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
rehabilitating raccoons and squirrels
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
that are brought to them
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
and then if they can't release them back
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
into the wild for whatever reason they
 
01:04:04.349 --> 01:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
euthanize them seems like a lot of waste
 
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
of time and money for the state to be
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
doing that and it if if the animal is
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated and can be kept as a pet
 
01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we want to allow somebody
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
to adopt
 
01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
it um I'm also I'm I mean especially if
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
you know you can get care for it and um
 
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
you have it under veterinar uh
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
veterinarian care where they're getting
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
proper vaccination or whatever they need
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
um but but I'm also concerned too about
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
people from other states because there
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
are are other states that allow these
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
animals as as pets that if those folks
 
01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
want to move to New Hampshire they have
 
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
to get rid of their pet either euthanize
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
it or give it away or whatever and um
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
and I find that kind of sad that people
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
have to uh get rid of a pet because New
 
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't allow them to keep it
 
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of my two cents on the
 
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
whole issue representative ger thank you
 
01:05:09.549 --> 01:05:09.559 align:start position:0%
madam chair and I wasn't here for the
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
hearing but I did watch it uh at home
 
01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
and remember distinctly the quote that
 
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby uh just referred to
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
I think that the question of
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation is opposed to having one
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
of these animals as a pet to me you're
 
01:05:23.549 --> 01:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
kind of two separate issues because
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation is about the health of
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
the animal having a healthy raccoon does
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
not make that raccoon raccoon suitable
 
01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
to be a pet uh and and what we heard I
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
think in the testimony was that there
 
01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
may be some cases where a raccoon or a
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
squirrel it seems less likely from what
 
01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
I heard in the case of a squirrel might
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
eventually be domesticated to the point
 
01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
where it would make a suitable pet but
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
the some of the folks we heard from
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
indicated that most are just not
 
01:05:52.109 --> 01:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
suitable in the long run for
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
domestication so to me I hear your point
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
about the resources that are put into
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation and the end result May in
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
the end still be youth in Asia but to me
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation is about the health of
 
01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
the animal not about domestication and
 
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
its suitability to be a
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
pet I hear you representative Mar
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair um so and
 
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
to representative jama's Point um
 
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
animals that are rehabilitated may not
 
01:06:23.549 --> 01:06:23.559 align:start position:0%
be ideal pets but the person who
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated that pet took the time
 
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
time money and energy to rehabilitate
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
that pet don't you think they should be
 
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to determine if they want to
 
01:06:35.309 --> 01:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
keep the animal in not instead of having
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
the animal exterminated I mean I think
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
this really is um this boils down to uh
 
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:45.640 align:start position:0%
uh whether we feel that people can make
 
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
those types of decisions for themselves
 
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
if they've done everything they can to
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate this animal they've they
 
01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
they followed all the rules as far as
 
01:06:57.789 --> 01:06:57.799 align:start position:0%
vaccinations as far as the health
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
bringing it to a veterinarian they've
 
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
developed a relationship with this
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
animal want to keep this animal
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we allow them to do that so I
 
01:07:08.269 --> 01:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
guess that would be the biggest question
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
I have about why and and I have to say I
 
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
was a little concerned when people
 
01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:14.839 align:start position:0%
giggled about this bill because I don't
 
01:07:16.269 --> 01:07:16.279 align:start position:0%
think it's about the animals I think
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
this is more about a personal um a
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
personal property issue as well I mean
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
my as much as I love my dog he's my
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
personal property and if someone were to
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
come in and say that I wasn't taken
 
01:07:30.029 --> 01:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
really good care of him and decide to
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
exterminate him I would be devastated so
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
I think we we we need to take a step
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
back and look at this as not just um a
 
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
squirrel and a raccoon but as someone's
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
personal property and something they've
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
invested themselves
 
01:07:47.549 --> 01:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
into respond uh sure representative ger
 
01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
and then representative Scully yeah I I
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
take my colleague's point it's a good
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
one we draw lines between domesticated
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
and Wild animals all over the place
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
right in federal law and state law right
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
and we can disagree on where that line
 
01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
ought to be drawn uh I I think what it
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
comes down to is when we're talking
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
about animals that are wild and were
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
born in the wild and lived some
 
01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of their life in the wild are
 
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
they suitable for domestication right
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
and the question of at what point does
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
an animal become a pet I would say that
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
somebody who re rehabilitates a wild
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
animal does not in the process make it
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
into a pet and I would say that as there
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
are reasons why we draw lines between
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
what is Wildlife as opposed to what is a
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
domesticated uh pet and and I think from
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
the evidence that I heard it seemed
 
01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
clear to me that raccoons and uh
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
squirrels who begin their lives in the
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
wild still remain on the wildlife Side
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
Of The Ledger represent Scully thank you
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair well I would say for me um
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
the idea of keeping raccoons as a pet is
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
a non-starter that're they're just
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
they're too big and they're potentially
 
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
dangerous and they are much more more
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
susceptible to rabies now Google is a
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
dangerous thing so I went on and I did
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
ask about um squirrel bites and at least
 
01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
from the what I saw on there they said
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
that uh they weren't recommending any
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
type of rabies treatment for squirrels
 
01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:12.759 align:start position:0%
because there such a low incidence of
 
01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
squirrels actually Contracting rabies
 
01:09:18.269 --> 01:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
it's not a a big issue for that animal
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
so but then again I I don't feel
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
strongly enough about this that I would
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
go through the time and effort to try to
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
re to revise this bill to have it
 
01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
squirrels only so in its current form I
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
would vote against it because I don't
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
think we should be allowing raccoons as
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
pets if somebody wants to amend this
 
01:09:37.709 --> 01:09:37.719 align:start position:0%
bill to squirrels I would be open to
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
it representative Bixby and then
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative King so what we heard
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
from the uh from the rehabilitators both
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
who were testifying and uh there a
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
number of uh people put in online
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
submissions rehabilitators are against
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:09:59.310 --> 01:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
because they think that their their
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
position is that when they are
 
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
rehabilitating they are working to keep
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
the animals able to work into to
 
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
function in the wild they do nothing
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
towards making them more more
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
domesticated even if that could happen
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
when the re Rehabilitation is
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
insufficient to make that animal uh able
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
to survive in the wild what it means is
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
that that animal is basically going to
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
die very soon anyway so euthanasia
 
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
versus release is not much difference uh
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
and they put they they made the attempt
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
the attempt didn't work so it's time to
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
say um that the animal is is not going
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
to make it that is a decision that
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators know that they're going
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
to have to make when they get into the
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
business they and we did not hear from
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
any rehabilitators that that this that
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
this was that it was a good idea to try
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
to make these pets if they failed the
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation uh we heard Fish and Game
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
say very strongly no it would be a very
 
01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
bad idea uh I think that in terms of the
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
you know the animals that are have that
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
grew up in the wild have been re there
 
01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
was an attempt of Rehabilitation and it
 
01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:19.719 align:start position:0%
failed then we need to go with the
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
professional advice of if it can't make
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
it in the wild it's
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
euthanasia uh in terms of
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh animals that someone might have in
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
another state and they're moving to New
 
01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh it's not quite as clear a
 
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
line what I'm concerned about there is
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
that this could be used as a loophole uh
 
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
and someone could go to another state
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
get an animal that was illicitly uh
 
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
obtained from the wild and say oh well I
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
had this in another state and they bring
 
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
it here uh and then we have a problem
 
01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
and when that when that animal is un
 
01:11:57.790 --> 01:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
deemed unsuitable for the household then
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
it goes to the animal shelter which
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't know how to deal with it and and
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
that and that's an an expense for our
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
animal shelters that they don't really
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
need to have dumped on them
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you madam
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
chair um this is a bill that I had a lot
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
of mixed feelings about um to start just
 
01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
to address representative bixby's
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
concern um to me it seems like if the
 
01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
animal is incapable of being
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated enough to survive in the
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
wild that it should be uh euthanized
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really follow for me
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of animals and
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
pets that couldn't make it in the wild I
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
mean people own rats that if you were to
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
release it they would be easy prey
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
because they've been so domesticated for
 
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
so long uh chickens I mean there's a lot
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
of animals that if we just let them out
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
in the wild they'd get eaten up real
 
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
quick so to me it's like okay if you
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate an animal and it's still
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
not good enough to survive in the wild
 
01:12:55.629 --> 01:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
then that to me seems like a candidate
 
01:12:59.310 --> 01:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
for keeping the pet um that being said
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
um I definitely do sympathize with the
 
01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
idea that so there's two situations here
 
01:13:09.629 --> 01:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
are we concerned about the humans or are
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
we concerned about the the the animals
 
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
because on the one hand we have well you
 
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
know they might have rabies and that
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
might bite somebody for me that's a risk
 
01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
that the owner would be willing to take
 
01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not concerned about the humans
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
really I'm more concerned about the
 
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
animals um to me personally I've always
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
had a problem with the idea of owning
 
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
caged animals I think it's really weird
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
owning Birds personally and we allow
 
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
that I mean you've taken everybody says
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
free as a bird the the bird is like the
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
most free spirited animal on planet
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
Earth and we capture it from the Amazon
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
and we ship it to some kid here in the
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
state so it can be stuck in a cage its
 
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
whole life I mean that's totally
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
inhumane and we allow that so if if we
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
if we can allow that I feel like
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
raccoons and squirrels is a no-brainer
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
especially because these animals you
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
know they they seem to get along with
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
humans a little better um you let a bird
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
out it's going to fly away unless it's a
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
paragan falcon or something it's gone uh
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
so but squirrels and raccoons they might
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
actually come back to the people that
 
01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
own it so I think the idea that we're
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
operating in the best interest of the
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
animal by killing it that doesn't make
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
any sense to me whatsoever and the and
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
and then the idea that like well we have
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
to kill it for the humans eh let them
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
take that risk so I mean I have very
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
mixed feelings about this um but I think
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
I would personally I tend towards aing
 
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
on the side of freedom and the idea
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
that's just like the government should
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
be dictating well these animals can be
 
01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
owned and these animals can't be owned I
 
01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
say leave it up to the people um but I
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
do personally ethically I think it's
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
very weird owning animals that really um
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
I just think I just think they shouldn't
 
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
be owned by people but then again you
 
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
know you've got St Francis of AI and he
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
had all these creatures come to him and
 
01:14:57.149 --> 01:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
and they seem to get along fine could
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
you imagine stealing these creatures
 
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
from St Francis of CCE and executing
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
them I don't think a lot of people would
 
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
go for that I mean we wouldn't even have
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
him he wouldn't even be the hero that he
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
is if we' had done that so so anyways
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's my two all right um I'm in the
 
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
interest of time I mean we've got uh one
 
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
two three four five six seven eight nine
 
01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
more bills to talk about before 11:00 I
 
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
don't know how you know
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
what how we wanted do this um
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
so can we just skip to the next bill and
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
we can we can take up discussion about
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
this next week as well or tomorrow even
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
263 excuse me um relative to the
 
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
applications to the cost of care fund
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
for livestock
 
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
care um I believe that uh with testimony
 
01:15:56.669 --> 01:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
last week we heard that um that bill
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
should be rolled into the bill that
 
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear this afternoon so uh
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
the plan I guess would be to to
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
um uh itl that bill uh correct I think
 
01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
that makes the most sense okay any
 
01:16:13.149 --> 01:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
question on
 
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
that uh HP 277 relative to the use of
 
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
the term F and Colt representative Bixby
 
01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is basically just correcting
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
an existing error in statute language uh
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
I hope there's no opposition to it
 
01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
no okay we are we are going to um exec
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
that bill out today HB 307 relative to
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
the food production area for Homestead
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
food representative Bixby you have an
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
amendment on that yes so I have an
 
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
amendment on this that I passed around
 
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment was largely proposed by
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
our uh constituent Addie uh zus
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
something like that uh Dave uh um zavos
 
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
zavos zavos yeah uh and uh and then I um
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
I brought it I uh ran it by food
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
protective services and uh they had uh
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
had a chance to look at it as well
 
01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
before then and uh oh they had oh sorry
 
01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
um so but I I then uh I did run it by
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
food protective services and they
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
suggested that um that the uh that it
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
that we add a section on making sure
 
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
that the floors and walls and ceilings
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
were hard surfaces uh and this is it
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
came back from uh OS in a slightly
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
different format than I sent it to them
 
01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
but I think it is simply the way that
 
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
they uh felt that it was most efficient
 
01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
to put it in statute by setting things
 
01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
up as uh a general directive followed by
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
a set of definitions as opposed to a set
 
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
of a set of General directives uh so um
 
01:18:05.709 --> 01:18:05.719 align:start position:0%
my sense is that this bill is uh ready
 
01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:09.560 align:start position:0%
to go with the amendment um I it will
 
01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
the basic idea of what it does is it
 
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
says that you can if you have the right
 
01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
sanitary facilities you can set up a a
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
secondary place in your home for food
 
01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
production that is not a kitchen one of
 
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
the advantages of this is that uh it
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
that secondary uh location May in fact
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
be uh better for isolating the food
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
production process from children pets uh
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
Etc and uh and husbands who want to eat
 
01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.629 align:start position:0%
Etc and uh and husbands who want to eat
your

01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
cookies so uh so uh I I does anyone have
 
01:18:51.629 --> 01:18:51.639 align:start position:0%
any questions about it no representative
 
01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
guber uh yes I just want to uh
 
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
compliment you I think this is what the
 
01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
homestead food producers will really
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate it's clear basic functional
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
sanitation everything's here so highly
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
supportive yes and and I would like to
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank Addie zos where if she happens to
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
be listening in to uh for the great com
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
contributions she made to this thank you
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
so much for your work on this it's great
 
01:19:15.719 --> 01:19:17.510 align:start position:0%
so much for your work on this it's great
really

01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
great um moving along we'll uh talk
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
about HB
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
396 exempting meat and meat food
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
products slaughtered and prepared in
 
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
state for
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
sale in state from certain
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
inspections um I think what we decided
 
01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
with that bill was uh first of firstly
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
um since you know we're dealing with uh
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
federal law here and we don't want to
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
um as the commissioner had said we
 
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
didn't want to put our farmers in Peril
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
of getting fined or hauled off to jail
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
for doing this against the law and
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that we perhaps do that
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
with um cannabis and other things um we
 
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
thought it would be more prudent to
 
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
retain this
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill and um I have penned a letter I
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
which I'll pass out to
 
01:20:14.719 --> 01:20:17.189 align:start position:0%
which I'll pass out to
everybody

01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
um to our federal
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
delegation oh I don't have it with me I
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
have something else um
 
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
I will be pinning a um or the committee
 
01:20:31.229 --> 01:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
committee is doing a letter to the
 
01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:33.719 align:start position:0%
federal delegation right yeah I think
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
that what we are the approach was we
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
were going to I think you're mixing this
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
up with a different with the res we have
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
a resolution so so the idea is that uh
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
we will ask for rule suspension for late
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
drafting of a resolution exactly yeah
 
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
and and also and that resolution is will
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
be something that is just voted on by
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
the house it's a house resolution so we
 
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
don't the Senate doesn't do resolutions
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
for some reason so uh so it's going to
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
be house resolution uh and uh we have a
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
draft uh idea of that resolution from
 
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
the Farm Bureau which um representative
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
Aon and I are going to sit down and edit
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
significantly y uh and to make it so
 
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
that there are not 20 whereas Clauses
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
right and uh and then we are hoping that
 
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
that resolution is something that can
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
pass easily with on on the house because
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to get leadership on
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
both sides to uh help us with that
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
motion right okay uh and I I I think the
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
letter you're think yes for a different
 
01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
bill yeah
 
01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so yeah So the plan is to
 
01:21:51.070 --> 01:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
retain that bill and then uh we have
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
this joint
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
resolution um and
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
that's one one quick note on that on
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
that ret retention um the reason we're
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
retaining it rather than it yelling it
 
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
is because if by some chance the federal
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
government manages to get a bill out
 
01:22:09.629 --> 01:22:09.639 align:start position:0%
that will would allow us to do something
 
01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:13.639 align:start position:0%
we'd have a vehicle to work with yeah
 
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
yeah me see okay uh moving along to HB
 
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
55 allowing the sale of freeze-dried
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
foods produced in Homestead food
 
01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
operations uh the sub commmittee the
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
food safety subcommittee met this
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
was okay so that's 505 the freeze-dried
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
food so I drafted up um some language
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
that I've shared with
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
everybody and
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
um the committee the subcommittee
 
01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
discussed this and
 
01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
um basically we made a couple of changes
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
to this as well so I'm going to take
 
01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
these changes and submit them to OS to
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
make an amendment that we can talk about
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
next week but
 
01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
basically we I I've added a whole new
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
section rather than the simplistic one
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
that uh representative shamberg
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
presented to us last week um this whole
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
new section basically
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
says uh gives you know how um the the
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
the protocol to making Freez dried foods
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
um and that we could we could allow for
 
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
cut up fruits and vegetables under
 
01:23:45.149 --> 01:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
certain things if they do certain things
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
we would not allow Tomatoes or melons
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
because those are very um high content
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
in water I've taken a lot of this
 
01:23:55.709 --> 01:23:55.719 align:start position:0%
information Direct directly off the USDA
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
website on how uh freeze-dried foods
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
prepared um we have a section that would
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
allow freeze-dried meats that raw meat
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
would not be
 
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried um you would have to cook
 
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
the meat and then freeze dry it that's
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
something that you know that we should
 
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
as a committee think about if we want to
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
allow freeze-dried meat um vegetables
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
and fruits and
 
01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
also I had another section in here uh
 
01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
other foods that are permissible to be
 
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried are already commercially
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
prepared foods including ice cream and
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
yogurt we had samples of the ice cream
 
01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:35.719 align:start position:0%
last week so and they they testified
 
01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
that they bought commercially uh
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
produced food that was already safe for
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
consumption they just freeze-dried it
 
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
and want to be able to sell it so those
 
01:24:49.709 --> 01:24:49.719 align:start position:0%
are the um the the ways the things that
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
could be freeze-dried and how they
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
should be freeze-dried um we want to add
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
in a
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
um some language oh yeah we also have
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
about how it should be sold it's only
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
sold within New Hampshire from Farm
 
01:25:07.109 --> 01:25:07.119 align:start position:0%
stands and so forth um how it should be
 
01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
packaged and
 
01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.550 align:start position:0%
packaged and
labeled

01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
labeled
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
um and that's basically what we have for
 
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
that representative Bixby and then
 
01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
wheeler have you had a chance to run
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
this by food Protective Services I have
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
not I was going to discuss that with
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
them as well okay
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
yeah representative wheeler was going to
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
say thank you for writing the amendment
 
01:25:31.109 --> 01:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
I had tried that Freeze stried ice cream
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
I ended up giving it to my baby cousins
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
it was just left me wanting real ice
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
cream I tried it I this is just almost
 
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
good but I thought it was not not quite
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
but it is I really appreciated them
 
01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
coming forward and I think finding out
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
some way to make it so they can run
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
their business easier is a good way to
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
go forward thank you any other
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
comments okay thank you so then moving
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.109 --> 01:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
642 okay allowing the sale of dehydrated
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
meat I've also passed out um a proposed
 
01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
amendment and it's just basically fixing
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh some of the things that were left out
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
of the um original bill from OS drafting
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
they had made a mistake in the first
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
part um saying that a meat producer
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
distributor who has a license to sell
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
USDA inspected meat may sell us da
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
inspected meat if it has been
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried well that this is not a
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried bill so we had that struck
 
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
out and I would put the word dehydrated
 
01:26:35.709 --> 01:26:35.719 align:start position:0%
in there
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
um we want to also add in that meat
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
would be dried in an NSF certified food
 
01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
dehydrator as opposed to any old food
 
01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
dehydrator so that way that makes sure
 
01:26:55.709 --> 01:26:55.719 align:start position:0%
that um you know we we have a um
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
a an item that they're using in their
 
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
production that is um you know certified
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
for using it for that purpose and then
 
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
um I added a portion that was
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
highlighted on this copy that was also
 
01:27:15.149 --> 01:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
left out in drafting that limits the
 
01:27:17.709 --> 01:27:17.719 align:start position:0%
amount of freeze-dried of dehydrated
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
meat that they could produce and sell so
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
um that would ensure that they're not
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
that they're keeping their batches small
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
and that they're not you know making so
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
much that they're not uh they would be
 
01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
more it's a matter it's a matter of
 
01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:37.639 align:start position:0%
really controlling the risk of foodborn
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
illness so um representative Miner thank
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
you chairman excuse
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
me thank you chair chairwoman uh Aon I
 
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
think you've done a great job on this
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
amendment a lot of thought has gone into
 
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
this and I want to thank you for taking
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
the time to do it thank you
 
01:27:56.830 --> 01:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
questions represent Bixby I'm just not
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
seeing where you have the what line the
 
01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
the uh NSF it's not in there we we added
 
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
that in in the subcommittee okay so so
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
this is something so that's that's to be
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
to be added to be added yes yep
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
okay and I will go through both of these
 
01:28:19.709 --> 01:28:19.719 align:start position:0%
uh amendments with you guys just to see
 
01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
your get your thoughts on it
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:31.149 --> 01:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
hb77 representative Penza what do you
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
that thank you madam chair I had sent
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
around um electronically changes to 707
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
and then I um of course had them printed
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
as well um for that work session I don't
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
have this definitely not enough copies I
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
didn't get more um I kind of held on to
 
01:29:01.390 --> 01:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
these so I can pass these around again
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
um for people that want them in front of
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
them while we could talk about it um the
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
um the only changes that are going to be
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
made to
 
01:29:15.629 --> 01:29:15.639 align:start position:0%
707 um versus the you know all the red
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
lines that I had already worked on um is
 
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
adding in the lee8 component which um
 
01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:24.790 align:start position:0%
adding in the lee8 component which um
represented

01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
represented
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
um ger is going to give me the language
 
01:29:31.550 --> 01:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
for um we have um you know and I'd like
 
01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
to talk about that here to see if it's
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
um if it's necessary um or not to
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
possibly um
 
01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
modify um 10 to the 10 to the5 if we
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
were going to cons can um um consider
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
making that 10 to the4 for I don't know
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
if we necessarily need to do that only
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
because um if we're looking to uh do a
 
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:06.280 align:start position:0%
specific carve out for expansions then
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
um those
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
um in with certain rules and criteria of
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
landfills that are currently operating
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
not not that they would necessarily be
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
um grandfathered in um it would be more
 
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
so that they are running in full
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
compliance they want to open up a cell
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
there's still um uh multitudes of areas
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
of new technology in regards with liner
 
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
and all of that that will still be fall
 
01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
under the current 800 rules that are in
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
place um and and then if it's about
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
certain things that have to do with
 
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
setbacks um you know if that landfill is
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
in like I said in full
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
compliance um then there's other um
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's other pieces that um could be
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
brought in let's say for example um clay
 
01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
that could get make them um less uh less
 
01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
time of travel and those types of things
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
so um I don't I don't foresee any
 
01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
changes any further changes to 707 than
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
what I've put forward except for maybe
 
01:31:19.679 --> 01:31:21.470 align:start position:0%
what I've put forward except for maybe
um5

01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
um5
 
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
to4 um as well as
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
um the leech 8 piece and then even
 
01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
possibly removing the one line um in a
 
01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
sense that
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
is um that's actually think I'm on page
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
page it's
 
01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:47.109 align:start position:0%
page it's
on

01:31:47.109 --> 01:31:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
um it's the one it's the one um
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
disclaimer in regards with expansions so
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
Al other than that I don't um I don't
 
01:31:58.830 --> 01:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
have any other changes to 707 at this
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
point all of the all of the work and the
 
01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
fixes have been
 
01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:06.280 align:start position:0%
done okay representative gerana thank
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you representative
 
01:32:09.629 --> 01:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
Penza for all the hard work that you've
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
you've put into this um so I I have as
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
representative Penza pointed out uh I
 
01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
have I'm in the process of working on
 
01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
some language regarding the lee8
 
01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
transfer area uh and protections around
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
that uh I have reached out to director
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
whimet and and we've started to
 
01:32:31.709 --> 01:32:31.719 align:start position:0%
correspond it's it's a complicated issue
 
01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm in the process with the the
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
director of looking through what's
 
01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
currently in rules regarding safety
 
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
Protections in that lee8 transfer area
 
01:32:42.510 --> 01:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if it's possible for us
 
01:32:45.629 --> 01:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
to do with the the lee8 transfer area
 
01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:47.719 align:start position:0%
and the 10 to theg 5th or 10 to the
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
ne4th if it's possible for us to do a
 
01:32:52.669 --> 01:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
solid waste subcommittee meeting perhaps
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
next week to talk about those two issues
 
01:32:57.629 --> 01:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
so that we can then bring it to the
 
01:33:00.669 --> 01:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
committee with a consensus around those
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
two issues in
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%

01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
proceed with that otherwise we would
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
have to meet on a Monday or the
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
Wednesday that week
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
um but I you know I don't want to get
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
too too close to March 18th which is the
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
Tuesday which is two days before
 
01:34:12.109 --> 01:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
everything has to be done so if we can
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
get everything wrapped up by next week
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
um and meet we could possibly meet again
 
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:20.360 align:start position:0%
Wednesday March 12th if we need to exec
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
out any other remaining bills that we
 
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
have but um
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's the plan so okay you guys if you
 
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
want to do further work on 707 that
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
fine okay I guess
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
the I'm I'm wondering if the solid way
 
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will be able to have a
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
complete Amendment on
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:02.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
really it's just the Lee piece really um
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh we I mean if we have the if we have
 
01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
that language buttoned up then it'll be
 
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
inserted and we should have that um
 
01:35:18.750 --> 01:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
forward I don't have a calendar in front
 
01:35:21.629 --> 01:35:21.639 align:start position:0%
of me um can you tell me the dates of
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
the next couple Tuesdays so
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
the next next week of course is March
 
01:35:30.629 --> 01:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
11th Y and then um there's also an
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to meet on Wednesday
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
March 12th uh Tuesday March 18th we have
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Farm Bureau young
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
breakfast farmer
 
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
breakfast so um you know it's possible
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
for us to come in here and exea Bill out
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
if we need to do that um okay so you
 
01:35:56.430 --> 01:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
know we have have that that at our at
 
01:35:58.590 --> 01:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
our disposal I mean we have we can meet
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
any days I mean other than
 
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
Thursdays represent Miner thank you
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
madam chair I think we're almost there I
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
think the subcommittee is doing an
 
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
excellent job on this thing and I think
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll absolutely have this U exact
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
by um um by next uh committee
 
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
meeting representative gerana yes thank
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
you uh yeah I I appreciate that V of
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
confidence and I agree representative
 
01:36:25.390 --> 01:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
King has has done a great great job of
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh working with that subcommittee uh and
 
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
and I think yeah we can prepare whatever
 
01:36:33.629 --> 01:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
amendments and have them to present at
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
the for discussion at the subcommittee
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
meeting and then be able to move ahead
 
01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
to the whole committee I think it's just
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
important to have some consensus among
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
that bipartisan group and then bring it
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
together to the committee but we can
 
01:36:48.910 --> 01:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
have those amendments prepared for next
 
01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
week and then have them prepared for the
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
whole committee for next week yeah and
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
then the goal would be execute on on the
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
18th then well if we can execute on the
 
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
11th we can execute on the 18th perfect
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative Scully thank
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
you Madame
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
chair would it be possible
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
to um involve the dees again to create
 
01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
another GIS map to see what the
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
Practical result or impact is of the new
 
01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
uh setback restrictions when he did that
 
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
for the first bill and it became quite
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
clear that it it there were so many that
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
it basically made citing a landfill in
 
01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire practically impossible
 
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
well I'll ask him thank you yep okay um
 
01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
moving on to HB 779 allowing the sale of
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
rabbit meat in interstate commerce
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby okay so uh this bill
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
came to us as uh a good idea that was
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
badly executed uh and uh the
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner of um uh uh commissioner
 
01:37:59.589 --> 01:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
jff Jasper pointed out how a lot of the
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh references in statute were just
 
01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
really off base uh the good idea part of
 
01:38:09.310 --> 01:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
it is we already have a system for doing
 
01:38:12.669 --> 01:38:12.679 align:start position:0%
uh for selling uh farm raised rabbit New
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire farm raised rabbits to
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
restaurants and there's a mechanism for
 
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
training to make sure that people know
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
what they're doing when they do that uh
 
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
and uh so I uh consulted with
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper about where this
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
should sit in statute he pointed out
 
01:38:31.149 --> 01:38:31.159 align:start position:0%
that according to the
 
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
USDA the so uh rabbit is considered a
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
non-amendable species so it's not
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
governed by USDA Slaughter rules uh the
 
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
usda's position on rabbit meat is that
 
01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
as long as it is dealt with uh
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
conforming with state health food safety
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
laws then it is accept able uh to the
 
01:39:00.189 --> 01:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
USDA so uh what I did was I basically
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
created another section underneath the
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
statue that allows sale to restaurants
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh that also allows sale to uh uh sale
 
01:39:14.830 --> 01:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
at a farm stand at a farm or at a
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
farmer's market as long as it meets the
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh correct Protections in terms of
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
making sure that it is packaged
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
correctly that it is trans uh
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
transported safely to where it's going
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
to end up uh and that it is labeled
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
correctly and that whoever is doing this
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
has the um has taken the uh rabbit and
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
poultry uh um production course that is
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh offered by Cooperative Extension
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
several times a year uh so uh it's uh
 
01:39:53.589 --> 01:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
the um the resulting amendment is a fair
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
simpler than the original Bill and uh I
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
also ran this by food safety uh uh
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
services and they caught a couple of U
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
drafting errors that I had made which
 
01:40:11.550 --> 01:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
for which I thank them and um but said
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
that it is basically uh workable uh with
 
01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:16.229 align:start position:0%
that it is basically uh workable uh with
the

01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
corrections okay sounds good I'm looking
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
forward to supporting that bill and its
 
01:40:25.629 --> 01:40:25.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment and last but not least
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
hr13 representative ger you were working
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%

amendment of an
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
amendment uh and hopefully we've got the
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
we've got it now U so as you can see
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
it's been dramatically reduced we have

three warehouses uh and they are all
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
specific to Forest L Forest Lake orb the
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
North country in the case of the second
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
whereas and this was a product of a lot
 
01:40:55.870 --> 01:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
discussions with members about what they
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to see in the um in the final
 
01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:03.560 align:start position:0%

you all right so committee members I
 
03:32:26.030 --> 03:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted you to be aware I received a
 
03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
communication from the chairman of the
 
03:32:30.510 --> 03:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
house committee on
 
03:32:33.830 --> 03:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
finance uh representative

Wier and he writes dear chairman Aaron
 
03:32:38.710 --> 03:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
as you know the enabling bill for the
 
03:32:42.510 --> 03:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
budget hb2 often includes policy changes
 
03:32:44.309 --> 03:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
which affect the spending in
 
03:32:46.830 --> 03:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
hb1 these Poli policy changes would
 
03:32:48.910 --> 03:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
affect functions of which your committee
 
03:32:48.920 --> 03:32:49.870 align:start position:0%
affect functions of which your committee
has

03:32:49.870 --> 03:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:32:52.229 --> 03:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
oversight sometimes this is a reflection
 
03:32:55.269 --> 03:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
of bills already in your committee but
 
03:32:56.990 --> 03:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes it is a complete
 
03:32:58.950 --> 03:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
restructuring before the finance

03:36:29.349 --> 03:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:35.150 --> 03:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:37.950 --> 03:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
well okay should I continue but you can
 
03:36:42.030 --> 03:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:45.950 --> 03:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay so um it's uh page two which is
 
03:36:51.670 --> 03:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
labeled as page 15 it's just the the
 
03:36:54.830 --> 03:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
back of page one and uh it goes through
 
03:36:57.429 --> 03:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
all the the Roman numerals and it's
 
03:36:58.950 --> 03:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
basically it's giving you the
 
03:37:01.030 --> 03:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
definitions so that when we build the
 
03:37:04.550 --> 03:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
rest of the the bill I guess you call it
 
03:37:07.229 --> 03:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
it it we know what the definitions are
 
03:37:10.550 --> 03:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
and uh on Roman numeral 8 uh major solid
 
03:37:13.030 --> 03:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
waste disposal facility means a location
 
03:37:14.950 --> 03:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
system or physical structure for the
 
03:37:17.229 --> 03:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
collection separation storage transfer
 
03:37:18.830 --> 03:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
processing treatment or disposal of
 
03:37:21.150 --> 03:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
solid waste with a proposed waste
 
03:37:22.990 --> 03:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
acceptance rate of greater than 100,000
 
03:37:25.510 --> 03:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
tons per year and then this is the part
 
03:37:34.030 --> 03:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:36.349 --> 03:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
circled okay and then the part I circled
 
03:37:38.510 --> 03:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
is the last L last sentence it says
 
03:37:40.870 --> 03:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
major solid waste disposal facility does
 
03:37:43.750 --> 03:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
not include any facility proposed to be
 
03:37:45.870 --> 03:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
constructed by a New Hampshire municipal
 
03:37:48.910 --> 03:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
government and I guess one of the
 
03:37:51.030 --> 03:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
concerns I don't know somebody can maybe
 
03:37:52.910 --> 03:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
address this and it's not a concern at
 
03:37:55.510 --> 03:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
all but what I'm concerned about is you
 
03:37:57.510 --> 03:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
know it's not a guarantee that every
 
03:38:00.030 --> 03:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
landfill is going to be privately run it
 
03:38:02.550 --> 03:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
could potentially be that a municipality
 
03:38:05.870 --> 03:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
runs a landfill in which case this whole
 
03:38:08.269 --> 03:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
bill and all the rules and restrictions
 
03:38:10.910 --> 03:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
and and and everything they put in there
 
03:38:13.189 --> 03:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
would be moot because it's run by
 
03:38:15.750 --> 03:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
municipality so it seems like almost a
 
03:38:19.870 --> 03:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
sort of a a loophole to get around a a
 
03:38:22.670 --> 03:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
new landfill because it doesn't meet the
 
03:38:24.630 --> 03:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
definition of a major solid waste
 
03:38:26.469 --> 03:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
disposal facility so it sounds like it
 
03:38:28.469 --> 03:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
looks like rep uh representative Bixby
 
03:38:29.750 --> 03:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
might have a response I'd love to hear
 
03:38:31.950 --> 03:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
it yeah I would like to thank you for
 
03:38:35.910 --> 03:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
noticing that uh because uh one of the
 
03:38:38.510 --> 03:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
things um last term we had a bill that
 
03:38:41.469 --> 03:38:41.479 align:start position:0%
would have banned private landfills and
 
03:38:43.189 --> 03:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
they would all have to have been public
 
03:38:45.950 --> 03:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
but they could be run by a private
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh management company and this would
 
03:38:54.910 --> 03:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
basically uh create a a real gap for a
 
03:38:57.150 --> 03:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
priv a publicly owned landfill that was
 
03:39:01.030 --> 03:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
run by a private company uh and uh so I
 
03:39:03.030 --> 03:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
and I think you know the fact that it's
 
03:39:05.229 --> 03:39:05.239 align:start position:0%
owned by publicly or privately doesn't
 
03:39:10.110 --> 03:39:10.120 align:start position:0%
change the uh potential potentially
 
03:39:13.030 --> 03:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
problematic uh contents of a landfill or
 
03:39:15.150 --> 03:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
the problematic area ideas about you
 
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
know where that stuff men make may end
 
03:39:19.830 --> 03:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
up if it's not properly cited so I I
 
03:39:21.830 --> 03:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
think that I don't think this exemption
 
03:39:21.840 --> 03:39:25.710 align:start position:0%
think that I don't think this exemption
makes

03:39:25.710 --> 03:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:27.790 --> 03:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
sense okay
 
03:39:30.830 --> 03:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
so major solid waste disposal facility
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
does not include any facility proposed
 
03:39:34.150 --> 03:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
to be constructed by a New Hampshire
 
03:39:36.830 --> 03:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
municipal government so you're
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
saying what about a public owned
 
03:39:42.229 --> 03:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
landfill run by a private whether it's
 
03:39:45.469 --> 03:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
owned by the privately or publicly I
 
03:39:47.229 --> 03:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
mean it just seems like a loophole here
 
03:39:49.590 --> 03:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
if the if it's constructed by New
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire municipal government then
 
03:39:53.229 --> 03:39:53.239 align:start position:0%
everything we read in the next 10 pages
 
03:39:56.070 --> 03:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
or so is like moot y okay that's my
 
03:39:57.790 --> 03:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
concern okay
 
03:39:57.800 --> 03:39:59.670 align:start position:0%
concern okay
gotcha

03:39:59.670 --> 03:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
gotcha
 
03:40:03.790 --> 03:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
um grber and then Penza thank you thank
 
03:40:06.229 --> 03:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
you I just have a few overall comments
 
03:40:07.950 --> 03:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh under the very the beginning the
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
first sentence Declaration of
 
03:40:13.030 --> 03:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
purpose just one minute anybody else
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a copy my cop you can use
 
03:40:19.389 --> 03:40:19.399 align:start position:0%
your copy back there anybody else over
 
03:40:22.030 --> 03:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:27.110 --> 03:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:29.110 --> 03:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for doing that
 
03:40:29.120 --> 03:40:31.950 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for doing that
representative

03:40:31.950 --> 03:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:35.870 --> 03:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
Miner go ahead I'm sorry yeah thank you
 
03:40:38.750 --> 03:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
m chair um the Declaration of purpose
 
03:40:41.110 --> 03:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
probably was very close to being correct
 
03:40:43.189 --> 03:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
a year ago but with the work of this
 
03:40:46.630 --> 03:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
committee um uh it's no longer actually
 
03:40:50.189 --> 03:40:50.199 align:start position:0%
uh I think correct um the purpose is is
 
03:40:52.910 --> 03:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
not clear for example I'll read it says
 
03:40:52.920 --> 03:40:54.150 align:start position:0%
not clear for example I'll read it says
that

03:40:54.150 --> 03:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:59.150 --> 03:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
um uh skip through there uh that uh the
 
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
solid Wass are not fully evaluated
 
03:41:03.790 --> 03:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
through existing regulatory reviews um
 
03:41:05.469 --> 03:41:05.479 align:start position:0%
and uh that's not taking into the
 
03:41:07.110 --> 03:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
account the number of bills that this
 
03:41:09.269 --> 03:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
committee has been put forward to the
 
03:41:12.750 --> 03:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
house um and that uh with the moror
 
03:41:14.830 --> 03:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
assuming that gets approved um that
 
03:41:16.349 --> 03:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
whole Pro process actually is being
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
addressed by many bills here that I
 
03:41:20.110 --> 03:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
don't think the author is familiar with
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
what's coming down okay that's one note
 
03:41:25.309 --> 03:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
U which is important when when it's the
 
03:41:28.550 --> 03:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
Declaration of purpose uh second thing I
 
03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
thought was significant is that on page
 
03:41:37.349 --> 03:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
17 it's numbered 17 um page 17 of 77 um
 
03:41:38.550 --> 03:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
and at the
 
03:41:41.229 --> 03:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
bottom it says an application for a
 
03:41:43.070 --> 03:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
certificate from this new committee they
 
03:41:46.229 --> 03:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
wish to create uh shall only be approved
 
03:41:48.790 --> 03:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
or denied by the committee quote after
 
03:41:51.070 --> 03:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
all other state agency approvals have
 
03:41:53.469 --> 03:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
been obtained that means anyone
 
03:41:55.790 --> 03:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
developing a a landfill here would have
 
03:41:58.790 --> 03:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
to go through a whole permitting process
 
03:42:00.830 --> 03:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
before they actually would assess it or
 
03:42:03.229 --> 03:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
whether it's should be next to a park or
 
03:42:05.510 --> 03:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
whatever that is you see what I mean uh
 
03:42:08.510 --> 03:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of a double jeopardy and
 
03:42:10.910 --> 03:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh clearly the bills that this committee
 
03:42:13.389 --> 03:42:13.399 align:start position:0%
has been working on particularly the
 
03:42:15.429 --> 03:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
ones looking at the net public benefit
 
03:42:17.229 --> 03:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
we look at that first so that they don't
 
03:42:18.750 --> 03:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
spend a huge amount of money and
 
03:42:20.590 --> 03:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
resources trying to meet all the
 
03:42:22.830 --> 03:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
environmental conditions if it's next to
 
03:42:26.550 --> 03:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
a lake or for example or a a park so I
 
03:42:29.429 --> 03:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
think that is a backwards process that I
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
think we've talked about quite a lot
 
03:42:33.269 --> 03:42:33.279 align:start position:0%
here how the process should be so that
 
03:42:36.550 --> 03:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have um uh private developers
 
03:42:38.229 --> 03:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
spending significant amounts of money
 
03:42:39.950 --> 03:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
and they oh sorry now we go through a
 
03:42:42.349 --> 03:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
second round and I think uh the state
 
03:42:43.910 --> 03:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
needs to work in partnership with the
 
03:42:46.309 --> 03:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
private sector so that there's one clear
 
03:42:48.429 --> 03:42:48.439 align:start position:0%
bite at the Apple and not after the fact
 
03:42:50.830 --> 03:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I agree with that that's my
 
03:42:53.429 --> 03:42:53.439 align:start position:0%
two major thing oh one last thing is the
 
03:42:56.830 --> 03:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
um uh on the bill that we uh submitted
 
03:43:00.550 --> 03:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
to the house for I think approval this
 
03:43:04.189 --> 03:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
this week for next week it's um net
 
03:43:06.990 --> 03:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
public benefit in here on page 18
 
03:43:09.710 --> 03:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
halfway down it talks about evaluating
 
03:43:11.790 --> 03:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
things such adverse things and positive
 
03:43:13.990 --> 03:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
things but such as traffic noise and
 
03:43:15.550 --> 03:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
odor but they never even even mentioned
 
03:43:18.389 --> 03:43:18.399 align:start position:0%
the issue of groundwater pollution or P
 
03:43:20.229 --> 03:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
so there's significant issues not here
 
03:43:21.950 --> 03:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
that we've actually talked about that we
 
03:43:23.630 --> 03:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
have in the legislation that we are
 
03:43:25.950 --> 03:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
proposing so I think what we've worked
 
03:43:30.189 --> 03:43:30.199 align:start position:0%
on actually uh is a stronger more
 
03:43:33.110 --> 03:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
grounded approach than coming in after
 
03:43:35.830 --> 03:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
the fact with this stuff thank you
 
03:43:35.840 --> 03:43:38.229 align:start position:0%
the fact with this stuff thank you
representive

03:43:38.229 --> 03:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
representive
 
03:43:41.590 --> 03:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
Penza uh thank you madam chair and I um
 
03:43:43.830 --> 03:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
I agree with all those points that
 
03:43:46.189 --> 03:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
representative were just made so I'm not
 
03:43:48.510 --> 03:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
going to repeat them
 
03:43:53.550 --> 03:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
um there's um there's a lot of wonderful
 
03:43:55.950 --> 03:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
ideas that are that are in this I
 
03:43:57.550 --> 03:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
thought it was 12 pages but it's I guess
 
03:44:01.550 --> 03:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
it is 10 um page document and you know
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
some of them have already been brought
 
03:44:09.149 --> 03:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
up but just how it starts off is um it
 
03:44:13.149 --> 03:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
is Crystal Clear where we have um you
 
03:44:15.670 --> 03:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
know right in the beginning of this you
 
03:44:17.469 --> 03:44:17.479 align:start position:0%
know in the statement of per or
 
03:44:22.110 --> 03:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
Declaration of purpose is we have um we
 
03:44:24.349 --> 03:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
have a bill that's that we've spent a a
 
03:44:28.550 --> 03:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
lot of time on that basically um is this
 
03:44:31.790 --> 03:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
but more and um and takes out things
 
03:44:36.550 --> 03:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
that you know um even from of course um
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
the department um we needed to take out
 
03:44:42.429 --> 03:44:42.439 align:start position:0%
at that point so there's just you know
 
03:44:46.510 --> 03:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
we have really in a sense three bills
 
03:44:52.110 --> 03:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
that um could nicely um we take this 10
 
03:44:55.469 --> 03:44:55.479 align:start position:0%
pages out and our three bills go in and
 
03:44:58.750 --> 03:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
um it does so much of what she's doing
 
03:45:03.229 --> 03:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
and more and the the council piece I I
 
03:45:05.149 --> 03:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
think we've many of us have already said
 
03:45:08.189 --> 03:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
that that that is um and after the fact
 
03:45:10.429 --> 03:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
putting the cart before the horse does
 
03:45:12.429 --> 03:45:12.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense we would never want
 
03:45:15.070 --> 03:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
anyone to go through an entire
 
03:45:18.070 --> 03:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
permitting process to then be told you
 
03:45:20.229 --> 03:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
know after whatever it may be five years
 
03:45:23.790 --> 03:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
or something like that um in spending um
 
03:45:26.229 --> 03:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of dollars that okay
 
03:45:29.510 --> 03:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
well um it just doesn't work um there's
 
03:45:32.469 --> 03:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
also things in here that there's and I
 
03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
have um a different copy of this at home
 
03:45:36.990 --> 03:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
that I left at home because I just
 
03:45:38.950 --> 03:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
didn't know if we were going to how much
 
03:45:41.389 --> 03:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
we were going to spend time on it um
 
03:45:44.070 --> 03:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
which is not lot a lot to go line by
 
03:45:47.630 --> 03:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
line here but there's also um many
 
03:45:50.830 --> 03:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
conflicts with with current within rules
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
and and statute and um current statute
 
03:45:55.790 --> 03:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
and um that I or rsas that are on the
 
03:45:59.910 --> 03:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
books um that make things not as um as
 
03:46:03.550 --> 03:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
clean as well so um I I really think
 
03:46:06.670 --> 03:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
that we have an opportunity here um and
 
03:46:09.469 --> 03:46:09.479 align:start position:0%
I I greatly thank the governor for the
 
03:46:12.349 --> 03:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
work that she's done in bringing um
 
03:46:14.110 --> 03:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
these solid waste issues to the
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
Forefront uh there's have been a lot of
 
03:46:18.550 --> 03:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
people for a long time that have been um
 
03:46:21.710 --> 03:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
speaking about it so um I thank her and
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
commend her for that I think that we can
 
03:46:28.870 --> 03:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
you know kind of be the answer to um to
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
or be the solution to a lot of her um
 
03:46:33.710 --> 03:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
issues in here from legislation that we
 
03:46:37.110 --> 03:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
have so um there's some stuff too in
 
03:46:39.469 --> 03:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
regards with public hearings you know
 
03:46:42.630 --> 03:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
these are um you know this these are all
 
03:46:45.429 --> 03:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
in a sense um already
 
03:46:48.630 --> 03:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
already law uh we have um
 
03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
1622 that was passed that is now in
 
03:46:55.110 --> 03:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
effect and has been for a few months now
 
03:46:59.070 --> 03:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
um that's a fantastic uh amount um too
 
03:47:01.550 --> 03:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
that has to do with public comment so so
 
03:47:05.349 --> 03:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
many of these things are um are already
 
03:47:08.630 --> 03:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
taken care of and that can be taken care
 
03:47:10.830 --> 03:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
of through three pieces of legislation
 
03:47:14.990 --> 03:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
that we have um right now so um I'm
 
03:47:16.950 --> 03:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
hoping that that's what we can kind of
 
03:47:20.070 --> 03:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
put forward together as our committee um
 
03:47:22.269 --> 03:47:22.279 align:start position:0%
for that and it would be you know a
 
03:47:24.910 --> 03:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful way for a lot of work to be
 
03:47:28.950 --> 03:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
able to get implemented inside of hb2 so
 
03:47:31.550 --> 03:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby yeah I I
 
03:47:35.910 --> 03:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
think um I uh also have uh similar
 
03:47:37.870 --> 03:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
concerns to representative guers and
 
03:47:42.309 --> 03:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative tenes uh another layer of
 
03:47:45.630 --> 03:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
that is that it seems like you not only
 
03:47:48.750 --> 03:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
is this uh would this committee be
 
03:47:51.030 --> 03:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
operating after all of the permitting
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
process which is lengthly
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
inexpensive but it also seems like it is
 
03:48:00.189 --> 03:48:00.199 align:start position:0%
creating an extra layer of bureaucracy
 
03:48:02.070 --> 03:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
when we don't really need another layer
 
03:48:05.349 --> 03:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
of bureaucracy what we need is to have
 
03:48:08.670 --> 03:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
the correct requirements incorporated
 
03:48:12.790 --> 03:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
into our existing structure and you know
 
03:48:15.630 --> 03:48:15.640 align:start position:0%
if there's any and you know perhaps even
 
03:48:17.229 --> 03:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
make that existing structure a little
 
03:48:20.110 --> 03:48:20.120 align:start position:0%
bit more efficient but uh what we don't
 
03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
want is to have another layer of red
 
03:48:25.950 --> 03:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
tape that is just sort of stuck on top
 
03:48:28.030 --> 03:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
of what's what we have already in terms
 
03:48:29.550 --> 03:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
of requirements we want to make sure
 
03:48:32.070 --> 03:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
that the existing require the we need to
 
03:48:33.870 --> 03:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
improve the existing structure we don't
 
03:48:37.870 --> 03:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
need to put another layer on top of it
 
03:48:40.110 --> 03:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
sure I just wanted to comment on that
 
03:48:41.910 --> 03:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
real thank you so much for bringing up
 
03:48:44.870 --> 03:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
that piece um I would love um represent
 
03:48:49.229 --> 03:48:49.239 align:start position:0%
ative ger to speak to this because um in
 
03:48:51.269 --> 03:48:51.279 align:start position:0%
creating another level another Council
 
03:48:54.110 --> 03:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
that isn't needed we have this Council
 
03:48:56.309 --> 03:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
in place that was doing this kind of
 
03:48:59.630 --> 03:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
work and when we noticed I mean we're
 
03:49:02.070 --> 03:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
very vocal on it when we noticed those
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
gaps we brought them forward to the
 
03:49:06.389 --> 03:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
previous administration and I I think
 
03:49:08.510 --> 03:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
that that's really important because
 
03:49:10.510 --> 03:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
when we realized that those gaps were
 
03:49:13.349 --> 03:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
there they weren't filled immediately um
 
03:49:17.349 --> 03:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
they still continued so so um let's get
 
03:49:20.830 --> 03:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
one Council working efficiently in in in
 
03:49:23.550 --> 03:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
at full capacity and representing the
 
03:49:25.349 --> 03:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
public and all of that before we would
 
03:49:27.389 --> 03:49:27.399 align:start position:0%
ever put any sort of other layer on top
 
03:49:29.269 --> 03:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
of that that you know let's get that
 
03:49:31.229 --> 03:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
worked I would love you to speak just to
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
that piece alone representative sure
 
03:49:35.790 --> 03:49:35.800 align:start position:0%
representative ger thank you thank you
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
representative poten you I I believe
 
03:49:40.870 --> 03:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
that we as a committee did a lot of work
 
03:49:44.110 --> 03:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
to produce a really good bill in HB 2115
 
03:49:46.590 --> 03:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
which is our public benefit Bill and
 
03:49:49.269 --> 03:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
after long discussions with Dees that
 
03:49:52.030 --> 03:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
consider both the impact on public
 
03:49:54.149 --> 03:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
health and the environment but also
 
03:49:55.910 --> 03:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about industry right and
 
03:49:58.349 --> 03:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
Industry needing to have a Marketplace
 
03:50:00.990 --> 03:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
that they understand and and is reliable
 
03:50:03.110 --> 03:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh we had talked about the idea of a of
 
03:50:05.469 --> 03:50:05.479 align:start position:0%
a site evaluation committee similar to
 
03:50:07.110 --> 03:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
the one that exists that looked at the
 
03:50:09.670 --> 03:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
Northern Pass project and the feeling
 
03:50:11.229 --> 03:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
was that that was adding a layer of
 
03:50:13.510 --> 03:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy that lengthened a process
 
03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
and added a level of uncertainty that
 
03:50:18.510 --> 03:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
isn't good for our communities or good
 
03:50:21.030 --> 03:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
for Industries who are trying to open
 
03:50:23.710 --> 03:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
new projects that what 25 doeses is it
 
03:50:26.510 --> 03:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
allows us to use existing resources in a
 
03:50:28.950 --> 03:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
much more streamlined way and by putting
 
03:50:31.790 --> 03:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
it up front you are making it clear
 
03:50:33.389 --> 03:50:33.399 align:start position:0%
right if you get a red light it's a red
 
03:50:35.510 --> 03:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
light on a site if you get a green light
 
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
then you move ahead to looking at the
 
03:50:40.550 --> 03:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
technical review of an application so uh
 
03:50:44.189 --> 03:50:44.199 align:start position:0%
I I feel that we have provided something
 
03:50:46.830 --> 03:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm glad to see hb2 incorporating
 
03:50:49.389 --> 03:50:49.399 align:start position:0%
the idea really of of net public benefit
 
03:50:50.590 --> 03:50:50.600 align:start position:0%
but I believe the bill that this
 
03:50:52.790 --> 03:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
committee produced is a much more
 
03:50:55.550 --> 03:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
efficient more streamlined process that
 
03:51:01.870 --> 03:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
is people uh and uh so that uh we don't
 
03:51:04.349 --> 03:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
so that it's we're not creating any
 
03:51:06.309 --> 03:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
necessary uh
 
03:51:09.389 --> 03:51:09.399 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um adversarial
 
03:51:13.389 --> 03:51:13.399 align:start position:0%
relationships uh but uh that would also
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
give you know if there are things that
 
03:51:16.510 --> 03:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
our bills are not covering that the
 
03:51:18.590 --> 03:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
governor wants to make sure are in there
 
03:51:21.710 --> 03:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
then that's also a room for nego some
 
03:51:23.870 --> 03:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
negotiation which has to happen pretty
 
03:51:27.670 --> 03:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
quickly I guess but uh but that that's
 
03:51:28.870 --> 03:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
one way of
 
03:51:32.229 --> 03:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
approaching uh approaching a piece of
 
03:51:35.269 --> 03:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
policy sometimes
 
03:51:40.030 --> 03:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
uh the uh hb2 is used by the Senate
 
03:51:42.429 --> 03:51:42.439 align:start position:0%
particularly to stick us with pieces of
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
policy that they don't want to have a
 
03:51:46.750 --> 03:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
thorough hearing in the house um that's
 
03:51:48.710 --> 03:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
another thing that it it happens it's
 
03:51:53.630 --> 03:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
not a perfect world um and uh Howard and
 
03:51:55.870 --> 03:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
I spent a fair amount of time before he
 
03:51:58.469 --> 03:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
was in a senate fighting fighting a
 
03:52:02.349 --> 03:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
particular instance of that but uh but
 
03:52:07.710 --> 03:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
um that's so I think in this case uh as
 
03:52:09.710 --> 03:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
long as we're really transparent about
 
03:52:11.469 --> 03:52:11.479 align:start position:0%
what what we're doing with all parties
 
03:52:13.510 --> 03:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
involved I think that this could be a
 
03:52:16.710 --> 03:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
very good way of of getting the getting
 
03:52:20.630 --> 03:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
these pieces of policy that clearly um
 
03:52:21.870 --> 03:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
are you
 
03:52:24.070 --> 03:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
know in are in line with what the
 
03:52:26.229 --> 03:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
governor's intent is here in terms of
 
03:52:28.429 --> 03:52:28.439 align:start position:0%
making sure that the landfill process is
 
03:52:30.990 --> 03:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
better I think that would that would be
 
03:52:34.269 --> 03:52:34.279 align:start position:0%
a reasonable use of hb2 as long as we
 
03:52:39.269 --> 03:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
don't mind the um lack of Purity in
 
03:52:39.279 --> 03:52:41.309 align:start position:0%
don't mind the um lack of Purity in
process

03:52:41.309 --> 03:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:52:47.149 --> 03:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:50.309 --> 03:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
representa Scully thank you madam
 
03:52:52.550 --> 03:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
chair it may have already been said but
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
I did also want to point out that this C
 
03:52:57.149 --> 03:52:57.159 align:start position:0%
uh increases the cost for both business
 
03:52:59.469 --> 03:52:59.479 align:start position:0%
and government itself uh there's a
 
03:53:02.750 --> 03:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
$20,000 base filing fee plus some other
 
03:53:05.550 --> 03:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
um add-ons in the trailer Bill yes in
 
03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill yeah and then it also
 
03:53:10.429 --> 03:53:10.439 align:start position:0%
um establishes another I guess full-time
 
03:53:12.590 --> 03:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
position they talk about a salary for an
 
03:53:14.710 --> 03:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
administrator right plus additional
 
03:53:17.870 --> 03:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
costs and I think that in this year I
 
03:53:19.830 --> 03:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
think the message has come down we're
 
03:53:22.510 --> 03:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
going to be hit um seeing harder times
 
03:53:25.189 --> 03:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
economically Statewide and we do not
 
03:53:27.750 --> 03:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
want to grow government at all unless
 
03:53:30.269 --> 03:53:30.279 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely necessary and given that
 
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
we do have hp215 which I think is a
 
03:53:36.469 --> 03:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
great bill I I think we don't need this
 
03:53:37.750 --> 03:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
and we don't need the cost or the
 
03:53:40.830 --> 03:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
additional personel okay representative
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
Penza yeah thank you representative
 
03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
Scully um yeah I agree
 
03:53:47.790 --> 03:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
I I that was that's a two pieces that I
 
03:53:49.149 --> 03:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
kind of forgot about that I have
 
03:53:51.149 --> 03:53:51.159 align:start position:0%
highlighted at home as well um in
 
03:53:54.030 --> 03:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
regards with the position in that too so
 
03:53:56.710 --> 03:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
um it it's just if it was something that
 
03:53:58.830 --> 03:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
was necessary that we you know that
 
03:54:00.990 --> 03:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
there was a gap that that would be one
 
03:54:02.830 --> 03:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
thing but there isn't a gap that that
 
03:54:05.030 --> 03:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's just it's there's not a need there
 
03:54:06.550 --> 03:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't want to grow and
 
03:54:09.309 --> 03:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
have positions that are not necessary um
 
03:54:12.149 --> 03:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
as well so that it's more important that
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's really not necessary so just spides
 
03:54:17.149 --> 03:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
um us really needing to tighten the
 
03:54:20.030 --> 03:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
budget and the pur strings because um of
 
03:54:22.229 --> 03:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
kind of what we're facing here um in New
 
03:54:25.830 --> 03:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I yeah it's just it's not even
 
03:54:27.750 --> 03:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
necessary at this point for me for me it
 
03:54:29.830 --> 03:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
just seems too that you know in in
 
03:54:31.990 --> 03:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
putting this committee together and you
 
03:54:33.510 --> 03:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
know who knows who's going to be on this
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
committee or who's going to get
 
03:54:37.710 --> 03:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
appointed I don't know but um it just
 
03:54:41.429 --> 03:54:41.439 align:start position:0%
seems to me that this committee is sort
 
03:54:44.469 --> 03:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
of taking up or doing the work of what
 
03:54:47.189 --> 03:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
es would normally do that's right and so
 
03:54:49.990 --> 03:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
why would we want to either duplicate
 
03:54:54.309 --> 03:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
efforts or um again put in that extra
 
03:54:56.870 --> 03:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
layer of bureaucracy where it really is
 
03:54:59.950 --> 03:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
not necessary representative
 
03:55:02.630 --> 03:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you madam chair just uh an
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
informational piece really kind of kind
 
03:55:06.389 --> 03:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
of your question representative King
 
03:55:08.950 --> 03:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
although I wanted to say it before um so
 
03:55:11.189 --> 03:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
what we have here is the summary from
 
03:55:13.309 --> 03:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
her pink sheet that came out to the
 
03:55:14.790 --> 03:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
house a couple of weeks ago after she
 
03:55:18.710 --> 03:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
gave her address which summarizes what
 
03:55:20.870 --> 03:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
just came out about an hour ago which is
 
03:55:23.750 --> 03:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
the full version of hb2 all 85 pages of
 
03:55:26.309 --> 03:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
it so if you're really interested in
 
03:55:27.710 --> 03:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
understanding what policy is in the
 
03:55:30.110 --> 03:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
budget beyond the summary then you can
 
03:55:32.110 --> 03:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
go online similar to how you would look
 
03:55:34.830 --> 03:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
up any other Bill and then read hb2 line
 
03:55:38.590 --> 03:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
by line the analysis of which has 102
 
03:55:41.189 --> 03:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
different points in it so you
 
03:55:45.229 --> 03:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
know well representative ger
 
03:55:47.349 --> 03:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I also another piece of
 
03:55:50.349 --> 03:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
215 which I think is really valuable
 
03:55:53.469 --> 03:55:53.479 align:start position:0%
that is in this a proposed language has
 
03:55:56.469 --> 03:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
to do with the independent third party
 
03:55:58.910 --> 03:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
that would be uh paid for by the
 
03:56:01.269 --> 03:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
applicant is not at all an exorbitant
 
03:56:02.830 --> 03:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
fee for companies that make a lot of
 
03:56:04.670 --> 03:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
money but I think it's really important
 
03:56:06.149 --> 03:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
especially for potential host
 
03:56:08.070 --> 03:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
communities because that report that
 
03:56:11.309 --> 03:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
will be produced that Dees will use to
 
03:56:13.189 --> 03:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
weigh potential benefits and potential
 
03:56:15.830 --> 03:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
harms is I I think also really valuable
 
03:56:17.710 --> 03:56:17.720 align:start position:0%
information for potential host
 
03:56:19.950 --> 03:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
communities to have they don't have the
 
03:56:21.710 --> 03:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
resources in many cases to hire
 
03:56:23.550 --> 03:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
independent third parties to do that
 
03:56:26.790 --> 03:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
work for them so this document says that
 
03:56:30.110 --> 03:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
Dees May contract an independent third
 
03:56:32.550 --> 03:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
party so it's in there but that's one of
 
03:56:35.110 --> 03:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
the reasons why I think 215 is superior
 
03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
because it is a streamlined process and
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
it requires the hiring of an independent
 
03:56:41.510 --> 03:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
third party to do an assessment that
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
Dees would use and would also be
 
03:56:46.110 --> 03:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
available to host communities
 
03:56:49.469 --> 03:56:49.479 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
comments okay so um what I'm going to do
 
03:56:58.990 --> 03:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
is uh I am well I guess I I will
 
03:57:03.070 --> 03:57:03.080 align:start position:0%
communicate um with chairman Wier uh
 
03:57:07.229 --> 03:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
regarding our consensus on um striking
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
this piece out and instead including in
 
03:57:15.309 --> 03:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
the language for hp215 HB 171 and H
 
03:57:21.030 --> 03:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
707 and um at the same time we need I
 
03:57:23.110 --> 03:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
I'll talk with him and see where we
 
03:57:25.990 --> 03:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
might be able to get together with um
 
03:57:28.349 --> 03:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
the governor or some folks from the
 
03:57:30.670 --> 03:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
governor's office to discuss that
 
03:57:33.189 --> 03:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
strategy and um and see where we are
 
03:57:37.070 --> 03:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
with that is that okay all right good
 
03:57:40.389 --> 03:57:40.399 align:start position:0%
enough okay well thank you for taking
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
the time I know it was a lengthy
 
03:57:44.630 --> 03:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
document um
 
03:57:47.510 --> 03:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
and uh there's you know certainly a lot
 
03:57:50.269 --> 03:57:50.279 align:start position:0%
a lot to look at I appreciate that
 
03:57:52.670 --> 03:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
you've taken the time to look at it and
 
03:57:54.750 --> 03:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
afford the community uh the committee
 
03:57:58.030 --> 03:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
with your um with your opinions on each
 
03:58:01.349 --> 03:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
of that and I think we all pretty much
 
03:58:04.030 --> 03:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
agree um on on how that should be
 
03:58:06.710 --> 03:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
handled so thank you
 
03:58:08.870 --> 03:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
all with
 
03:58:14.389 --> 03:58:14.399 align:start position:0%

the confiscation of animals from persons

suspected or charged with abuse of
 
04:02:32.670 --> 04:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
animals this bill came about after a
 
04:02:34.670 --> 04:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
horrible animal seizure incident
 
04:02:37.070 --> 04:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
happened this past April in Lee New
 
04:02:39.630 --> 04:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the details of this event will
 
04:02:42.870 --> 04:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
be explained in subsequent testimony but
 
04:02:45.229 --> 04:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
I would like to take this is time to go
 
04:02:47.349 --> 04:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
through the parts of this bill which
 
04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
seek to solve the problems which
 
04:02:51.269 --> 04:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
occurred with this kind of animal
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
seizure we need to make sure that when
 
04:02:57.030 --> 04:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
it comes to property seizure that due
 
04:02:59.790 --> 04:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
process is followed and that animals and
 
04:03:02.910 --> 04:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
their owners are treated properly and I
 
04:03:04.710 --> 04:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
hope you all have a copy of the bill in
 
04:03:06.550 --> 04:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
front of you because I'm going to go
 
04:03:06.560 --> 04:03:08.149 align:start position:0%
front of you because I'm going to go
through

04:03:08.149 --> 04:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:03:10.429 --> 04:03:10.439 align:start position:0%
it the language
 
04:03:14.510 --> 04:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
changes to RSA 644 col 8 were developed
 
04:03:16.670 --> 04:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire Farm Bureau the New
 
04:03:19.550 --> 04:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Agriculture UNH
 
04:03:22.229 --> 04:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
extension and other concerned parties
 
04:03:24.750 --> 04:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
after this event took place in Lee New
 
04:03:26.870 --> 04:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they felt that further
 
04:03:28.870 --> 04:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
language to existing statutes were
 
04:03:31.790 --> 04:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
needed to clarify procedures surrounding
 
04:03:34.910 --> 04:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty reporting and seizure and
 
04:03:36.990 --> 04:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
indicate who should or should not be
 
04:03:38.630 --> 04:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
involved in the
 
04:03:42.910 --> 04:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
process first off on page one lines 3 to
 
04:03:42.920 --> 04:03:45.389 align:start position:0%
process first off on page one lines 3 to
six

04:03:45.389 --> 04:03:45.399 align:start position:0%
six
 
04:03:46.790 --> 04:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that an
 
04:03:48.910 --> 04:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
investigating officer is advised by
 
04:03:50.590 --> 04:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
someone from the state veterinarian's
 
04:03:52.710 --> 04:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
office or a designated veterinarian that
 
04:03:53.830 --> 04:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
their office
 
04:03:55.990 --> 04:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
recommends we've already seen with
 
04:03:57.469 --> 04:03:57.479 align:start position:0%
another bill which was heard in our
 
04:03:59.269 --> 04:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
committee that law enforcement needs
 
04:04:02.030 --> 04:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
advice in these situations and we'd like
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the right people are
 
04:04:06.630 --> 04:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
giving advice we also want to make
 
04:04:08.309 --> 04:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
certain that no animals may be
 
04:04:11.429 --> 04:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
confiscated without a person legally
 
04:04:14.750 --> 04:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
charged in this case in Lee
 
04:04:17.110 --> 04:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
there were no charges made no
 
04:04:19.750 --> 04:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
convictions made and no due process
 
04:04:22.229 --> 04:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
regarding seizure of animals and yet a
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
person's animals were taken away some
 
04:04:28.149 --> 04:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
were euthanized some were adopted out
 
04:04:30.469 --> 04:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
and no one seems to know what happens to
 
04:04:31.710 --> 04:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
the remaining
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
ones this happened mostly because the
 
04:04:36.110 --> 04:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
owner was made to sign a document under
 
04:04:38.269 --> 04:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
duress without a clear understanding
 
04:04:41.830 --> 04:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
about what was being signed in any event
 
04:04:43.870 --> 04:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
the law should be quite clear about when
 
04:04:47.429 --> 04:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
animals can be taken away and by whom
 
04:04:49.429 --> 04:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
the owner of the animal should also know
 
04:04:53.550 --> 04:04:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:57.389 --> 04:04:57.399 align:start position:0%
with there is a um in the next section
 
04:05:00.630 --> 04:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
lines nine and 10 there is a change that
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be made here because of a
 
04:05:02.640 --> 04:05:03.790 align:start position:0%
needs to be made here because of a
drafting

04:05:03.790 --> 04:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
drafting
 
04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
error um it says here the person charged
 
04:05:08.550 --> 04:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
shall be made aware of this petition and
 
04:05:11.349 --> 04:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
writing by the arresting officer when it
 
04:05:13.070 --> 04:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
we're already talking about the person
 
04:05:15.550 --> 04:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
charged under the section can petition
 
04:05:18.030 --> 04:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
the court to seek an examination of the
 
04:05:20.469 --> 04:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
Animals by a veterinarian licensed under
 
04:05:20.479 --> 04:05:21.990 align:start position:0%
Animals by a veterinarian licensed under
RSA

04:05:21.990 --> 04:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:05:26.550 --> 04:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
332 uh hyen B and so what this next line
 
04:05:28.990 --> 04:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
should say is that the person charge
 
04:05:31.750 --> 04:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
shall be made aware of the ability to
 
04:05:33.309 --> 04:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
make this
 
04:05:36.189 --> 04:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
petition because if there if the person
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
charge shall be made aware of the
 
04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
petition I mean they're already making
 
04:05:40.750 --> 04:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
the petition they don't need to be aware
 
04:05:42.910 --> 04:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
of it so but they need to know that they
 
04:05:45.189 --> 04:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
have the ability to make this petition
 
04:05:46.429 --> 04:05:46.439 align:start position:0%
and they should be getting that in
 
04:05:48.670 --> 04:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
writing from the arresting
 
04:05:50.950 --> 04:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
officer so that's a change that needs to
 
04:05:55.510 --> 04:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
error in lines uh 11 through
 
04:06:03.309 --> 04:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
17 we're adding a new subparagraph that
 
04:06:05.389 --> 04:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
states that prior to any conviction of
 
04:06:08.630 --> 04:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect no confiscated animal
 
04:06:14.269 --> 04:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:15.870 --> 04:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
authorization of the
 
04:06:18.950 --> 04:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
owner they the animals can't be altered
 
04:06:21.269 --> 04:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
examples being spayed neutered or
 
04:06:23.750 --> 04:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
euthanized in the case in Lee animals
 
04:06:25.510 --> 04:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
were taken away that were already being
 
04:06:27.189 --> 04:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
treated for illnesses and under a
 
04:06:29.950 --> 04:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
veterinarian's care and some were simply
 
04:06:31.950 --> 04:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
euthanized after being
 
04:06:34.870 --> 04:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
taken there were also animals that were
 
04:06:38.309 --> 04:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
castrated this should simply not happen
 
04:06:39.910 --> 04:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
additionally in this section we are
 
04:06:41.830 --> 04:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
specifically making it clear that prior
 
04:06:44.510 --> 04:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
to a conviction of abuse or negle
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
no animal should be used to solicit
 
04:06:49.750 --> 04:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
donations or be used to fundraise by any
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
individual or
 
04:06:53.830 --> 04:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
organization these unfortunate incidents
 
04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
should not be used for purposeful
 
04:06:59.550 --> 04:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
purposeful gain by anyone especially if
 
04:07:01.389 --> 04:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
a case has not been brought to a court
 
04:07:04.429 --> 04:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
of law and
 
04:07:07.349 --> 04:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
adjudicated in lines 20 to
 
04:07:10.030 --> 04:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
21 we want to specify that only law
 
04:07:12.149 --> 04:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement or an animal control officer
 
04:07:14.510 --> 04:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
can take custody of animal animals and
 
04:07:16.510 --> 04:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
animals cannot be taken into temporary
 
04:07:19.149 --> 04:07:19.159 align:start position:0%
protective custody unless the owner or
 
04:07:21.790 --> 04:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
caretaker is not present or if there is
 
04:07:23.510 --> 04:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
a clear and eminent danger to the
 
04:07:26.590 --> 04:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
animal's Health animal seizure should
 
04:07:28.750 --> 04:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
not should be a matter between law
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the owner of the animals
 
04:07:34.670 --> 04:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
no other entity should be
 
04:07:40.550 --> 04:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:43.070 --> 04:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
7 we want to make sure that an owner of
 
04:07:44.750 --> 04:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
an an animal taken into protective
 
04:07:46.950 --> 04:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
custody has the right to have their
 
04:07:49.469 --> 04:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
animal examined by a veterinarian of his
 
04:07:51.750 --> 04:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
or her choice at the expense of the
 
04:07:54.510 --> 04:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
owner we want to make sure that the
 
04:07:56.510 --> 04:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarian examining the animals in
 
04:07:59.309 --> 04:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
question is familiar with the animals in
 
04:08:02.429 --> 04:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
question aside from the fact that we
 
04:08:04.269 --> 04:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have a dog or a cat
 
04:08:06.189 --> 04:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
veterinarian making assessments on
 
04:08:08.510 --> 04:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
animals they are unfamiliar with like
 
04:08:11.670 --> 04:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
livestock goats horses Etc but we also
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that if the animal is
 
04:08:15.429 --> 04:08:15.439 align:start position:0%
already being treated for an illness
 
04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
that the veterinarian that is involved
 
04:08:18.750 --> 04:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
in that treatment should be the one
 
04:08:18.760 --> 04:08:21.109 align:start position:0%
in that treatment should be the one
that's

04:08:21.109 --> 04:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:23.429 --> 04:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
involved as part of some statute
 
04:08:25.710 --> 04:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
housekeeping we want to eliminate lines
 
04:08:29.550 --> 04:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
12 to 26 on page two as we do not
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
currently do harness or live dog racing
 
04:08:35.109 --> 04:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
in our state anymore so that part of
 
04:08:38.830 --> 04:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
this uh current statute just needs to be
 
04:08:41.910 --> 04:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
stricken in lines 27 to
 
04:08:45.670 --> 04:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
29 on page two we want to ensure that
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
when lactating animals are confiscated
 
04:08:50.269 --> 04:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
that there is proof that the facility
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
that they are going to will provide
 
04:08:54.070 --> 04:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
proper care and Facilities to
 
04:08:57.149 --> 04:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
accommodate adults and their offspring
 
04:08:59.389 --> 04:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
we cannot allow animals to be taken away
 
04:09:02.030 --> 04:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
and euthanize because there's not proper
 
04:09:04.710 --> 04:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
milking facilities available or that
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
proper care is not available for
 
04:09:09.149 --> 04:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
lactating female and its
 
04:09:11.590 --> 04:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
babies I would say too that we should
 
04:09:14.149 --> 04:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
probably add here and believe that that
 
04:09:15.870 --> 04:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
was also a drafting error where
 
04:09:18.550 --> 04:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
something was left out that in a case of
 
04:09:20.550 --> 04:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
confiscation mothers should not be
 
04:09:22.910 --> 04:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
separated from their babies and vice
 
04:09:26.229 --> 04:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
versa for this case in Lee I was told
 
04:09:28.830 --> 04:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
that lactating females were taken away
 
04:09:30.389 --> 04:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
and were euthanized because there were
 
04:09:37.990 --> 04:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
concerning lines
 
04:09:42.990 --> 04:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
30-34 ensures that a person who made the
 
04:09:45.309 --> 04:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
complaint or report should not take part
 
04:09:47.710 --> 04:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
in or be present during the
 
04:09:50.349 --> 04:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
investigation also the person's taking
 
04:09:52.269 --> 04:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
possession of any animal seized as a
 
04:09:55.590 --> 04:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
result of a complaint may not take part
 
04:09:57.670 --> 04:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
or be present during the investigation
 
04:10:00.109 --> 04:10:00.119 align:start position:0%
into the complaint we do not want the
 
04:10:01.830 --> 04:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
person making the complaint or the
 
04:10:04.109 --> 04:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
person receiving the animals as a result
 
04:10:06.269 --> 04:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
of the complaint to be part of the
 
04:10:08.269 --> 04:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
investigation as they have a biased
 
04:10:10.189 --> 04:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
interest and they may have something to
 
04:10:12.670 --> 04:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
gain in the removal or possession of the
 
04:10:13.910 --> 04:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
animal in question
 
04:10:16.189 --> 04:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
question again the only people that
 
04:10:17.910 --> 04:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
should be part of the investigation is
 
04:10:20.830 --> 04:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
the animals owner law enforcement and a
 
04:10:23.189 --> 04:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
qualified veterinarian who can properly
 
04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
assess what is going
 
04:10:29.389 --> 04:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
on in lines 35 to 36 on page two and
 
04:10:32.510 --> 04:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
lines one to two on page three it says
 
04:10:34.389 --> 04:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
simply that if animals are confiscated
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
or taken into protective custody without
 
04:10:38.750 --> 04:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
the owner being charged with a crime
 
04:10:40.590 --> 04:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
then that is considered theft by
 
04:10:44.149 --> 04:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
unauthorized taking
 
04:10:49.630 --> 04:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
on page three lines 3 to 7 we clarify
 
04:10:52.550 --> 04:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
that any veterinarian or individual
 
04:10:55.109 --> 04:10:55.119 align:start position:0%
requested to provide assistance by law
 
04:10:57.269 --> 04:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement is protected and held
 
04:11:00.149 --> 04:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
harmless for criminal or civil
 
04:11:05.309 --> 04:11:05.319 align:start position:0%
liability on lines 21 to 23 on page
 
04:11:08.149 --> 04:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
three we also add that no livestock
 
04:11:09.950 --> 04:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
shall be confiscated or taken into
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
protective custody without the
 
04:11:13.990 --> 04:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the state V Arian or
 
04:11:14.000 --> 04:11:14.950 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the state V Arian or
their

04:11:14.950 --> 04:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:11:17.229 --> 04:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
design these are all very important
 
04:11:20.309 --> 04:11:20.319 align:start position:0%
changes to the statutes and they serve
 
04:11:22.429 --> 04:11:22.439 align:start position:0%
to clarify what should and should not
 
04:11:25.990 --> 04:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
happen in the event of a report of
 
04:11:29.070 --> 04:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
abuse there was a lot that went wrong in
 
04:11:31.070 --> 04:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
the Lee
 
04:11:34.710 --> 04:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
case these charges uh these changes to
 
04:11:36.790 --> 04:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
the current law will help make sure that
 
04:11:39.510 --> 04:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
due process is followed and that both
 
04:11:41.870 --> 04:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
people's rights and animals welfare is
 
04:11:41.880 --> 04:11:43.429 align:start position:0%
people's rights and animals welfare is
protected

04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
protected
 
04:11:45.630 --> 04:11:45.640 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take any
 
04:11:50.990 --> 04:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
questions um but um I would also uh say
 
04:11:55.750 --> 04:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
that there are people who are here today
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
who will give you more insight into why
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
these changes are
 
04:12:05.109 --> 04:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
necessary um and I also have written a
 
04:12:09.870 --> 04:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for your testimony
 
04:12:14.109 --> 04:12:14.119 align:start position:0%
and for introducing this Bill uh are
 
04:12:15.189 --> 04:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
there any
 
04:12:18.349 --> 04:12:18.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative King thank you
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um on page I guess it's
 
04:12:24.510 --> 04:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
considered one it's the back of the
 
04:12:28.630 --> 04:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
first page on lines 15 to 17 thank you
 
04:12:29.990 --> 04:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
for introducing the bill by the way and
 
04:12:32.109 --> 04:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking questions um it
 
04:12:35.109 --> 04:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
says um and you you touched on this um
 
04:12:37.750 --> 04:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
nor nor shall such animal or animals be
 
04:12:39.950 --> 04:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
used in any manner to solit solicit
 
04:12:42.070 --> 04:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
donations or to fundraise by any
 
04:12:43.910 --> 04:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
individual or organization
 
04:12:46.550 --> 04:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering sometimes when
 
04:12:48.670 --> 04:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
the state comes down on an
 
04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
individual um people will create like a
 
04:12:53.189 --> 04:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
GoFundMe for their legal defense or
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
something like that is that what you had
 
04:12:57.349 --> 04:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
in mind or can you just give me some
 
04:13:00.590 --> 04:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
examples of of what what this really is
 
04:13:02.910 --> 04:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
all about because it just seems weird
 
04:13:04.830 --> 04:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
that a person wouldn't be able to like
 
04:13:07.309 --> 04:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
kind of crowdfund a legal defense or
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
something what is that all about well
 
04:13:14.590 --> 04:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
um there's been many instances where um
 
04:13:19.710 --> 04:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
in situations of um animal seizures or
 
04:13:23.229 --> 04:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
um reports of animal abuse that there
 
04:13:23.239 --> 04:13:24.750 align:start position:0%
um reports of animal abuse that there
are

04:13:24.750 --> 04:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:13:27.389 --> 04:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
organizations um specifically some of
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
the animal rights
 
04:13:32.149 --> 04:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
organizations that will put out some
 
04:13:35.510 --> 04:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
sort of press release um I have one
 
04:13:35.520 --> 04:13:36.950 align:start position:0%
sort of press release um I have one
specifically

04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
04:13:43.469 --> 04:13:43.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:46.670 --> 04:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
that came out and reported this whole
 
04:13:49.990 --> 04:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
incident in Lee New Hampshire and all
 
04:13:53.229 --> 04:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
over it is um you know we're asking for
 
04:13:55.070 --> 04:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
the community's assistance and caring
 
04:13:57.790 --> 04:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
for these animals this is a fundraising
 
04:14:00.630 --> 04:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
mechanism and I don't believe that in
 
04:14:04.389 --> 04:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
these unfortunate inst instance
 
04:14:07.469 --> 04:14:07.479 align:start position:0%
instances whether they're legitimate uh
 
04:14:09.510 --> 04:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
reports or they're not legitimate
 
04:14:11.590 --> 04:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
reports that there should be
 
04:14:14.429 --> 04:14:14.439 align:start position:0%
organizations that are profiting from
 
04:14:18.269 --> 04:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
this um and you know they they not only
 
04:14:21.469 --> 04:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
profit from uh you know a press release
 
04:14:23.070 --> 04:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
that says oh look at all the great work
 
04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
04:14:26.670 --> 04:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
doing but they're also profiting off
 
04:14:30.269 --> 04:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
adopting out the animals um and and I
 
04:14:33.030 --> 04:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
think that um you know that again this
 
04:14:35.790 --> 04:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
is these are unfortunate incidences and
 
04:14:37.070 --> 04:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that people should
 
04:14:41.149 --> 04:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
profit off them follow up yes okay so um
 
04:14:43.550 --> 04:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification um
 
04:14:46.950 --> 04:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
so I see what you're saying as far
 
04:14:50.469 --> 04:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
as like institutions or organizations
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
but what I mean would it in your opinion
 
04:14:55.269 --> 04:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
would this also preclude like a
 
04:14:57.950 --> 04:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
crowdfunding for a defense of the people
 
04:14:59.630 --> 04:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
whose animals have been taken because it
 
04:15:02.189 --> 04:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
seems like this is a a a knife that cuts
 
04:15:04.229 --> 04:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
both ways a little bit and I'm just
 
04:15:07.870 --> 04:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if if your intention is that
 
04:15:10.149 --> 04:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
it would also hit somebody who's trying
 
04:15:13.710 --> 04:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
to crowd crowdfund a defense and then
 
04:15:15.750 --> 04:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
also just just on top of that I don't
 
04:15:19.229 --> 04:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
know it's just it's in subsection 8
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
there and it's there's like two
 
04:15:23.429 --> 04:15:23.439 align:start position:0%
different topics really being discussed
 
04:15:25.229 --> 04:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
in sub I mean there's only four lines
 
04:15:28.429 --> 04:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
but the two really I don't think go
 
04:15:29.710 --> 04:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
together I feel like it should be its
 
04:15:32.510 --> 04:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
own thing I don't know just yeah that
 
04:15:35.630 --> 04:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
you know that's uh certainly I I know
 
04:15:37.149 --> 04:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to have some
 
04:15:39.550 --> 04:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
amendments put into it and that's
 
04:15:41.510 --> 04:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
certainly something that we C we as a
 
04:15:45.630 --> 04:15:45.640 align:start position:0%
committee can discuss uh and how to uh
 
04:15:49.030 --> 04:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
break that apart um and probably make it
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
nature representative
 
04:15:58.189 --> 04:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
04:16:01.710 --> 04:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question I have I have a few
 
04:16:05.750 --> 04:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm not you know well versed in the
 
04:16:08.790 --> 04:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
um in this legislation or you know um
 
04:16:11.389 --> 04:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
this cruelty to animals section of of
 
04:16:13.670 --> 04:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
current statute so
 
04:16:14.950 --> 04:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
um right
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
now due process and all of these things
 
04:16:19.870 --> 04:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
are extremely important I I you know I
 
04:16:21.469 --> 04:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
commend you for putting this forward
 
04:16:23.269 --> 04:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
especially I'm familiar with the
 
04:16:25.469 --> 04:16:25.479 align:start position:0%
situation that took place in Lee because
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
I'm in straford County
 
04:16:31.510 --> 04:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
um I guess my question is is
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
are where where we're in you know
 
04:16:37.990 --> 04:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
talking in bold here these things are um
 
04:16:39.870 --> 04:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
they're not currently in statute so are
 
04:16:41.950 --> 04:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
they not happening um they're just
 
04:16:44.469 --> 04:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
complete gaps are not taking place are
 
04:16:46.750 --> 04:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
some people like may be doing it but
 
04:16:47.750 --> 04:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
others aren't do you know what I'm
 
04:16:49.510 --> 04:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
saying okay yeah that's why we want to
 
04:16:51.550 --> 04:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
clarify so just trying to keep it
 
04:16:55.469 --> 04:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
consistent yes sir okay and um in
 
04:16:59.149 --> 04:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
regards with the veterinarian piece so
 
04:17:01.910 --> 04:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
if right now someone confiscates an
 
04:17:06.149 --> 04:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
animal and they are under that care um
 
04:17:09.790 --> 04:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
are are we just um ignoring their
 
04:17:12.590 --> 04:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
current their current doctor in a sense
 
04:17:15.309 --> 04:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
or like I don't in some instances I
 
04:17:16.990 --> 04:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
believe that's true and that's why I
 
04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that clear in statute um
 
04:17:24.309 --> 04:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
that there is the ability to have a
 
04:17:25.910 --> 04:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
veterinarian who's currently caring for
 
04:17:27.469 --> 04:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
those animals be
 
04:17:27.479 --> 04:17:28.990 align:start position:0%
those animals be
involved

04:17:28.990 --> 04:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
involved
 
04:17:31.870 --> 04:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
um yep I'm sorry thank
 
04:17:35.870 --> 04:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
you yes definitely a quick followup um
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
in regards with the um the person being
 
04:17:41.910 --> 04:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
charged being made uh made aware of the
 
04:17:45.550 --> 04:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
petition in writing how would that can
 
04:17:48.910 --> 04:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
you explain to me in a perfect world um
 
04:17:50.070 --> 04:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
CU I know there's probably going to be
 
04:17:51.790 --> 04:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
some work that needs to be done a little
 
04:17:54.429 --> 04:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
bit on the bill like what proc how do
 
04:17:57.229 --> 04:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
how what process works like that like
 
04:17:59.830 --> 04:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
give me kind of like from the time of
 
04:18:01.950 --> 04:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
you know a charge or an arrest or
 
04:18:04.309 --> 04:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
whatever like how how does someone make
 
04:18:06.109 --> 04:18:06.119 align:start position:0%
sure that they get their paperwork and
 
04:18:08.469 --> 04:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
all of that kind of stuff can you so I I
 
04:18:11.510 --> 04:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
would say that a person if a person is
 
04:18:14.469 --> 04:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
charged under this ction so they can
 
04:18:15.910 --> 04:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
petition the court to seek an
 
04:18:17.349 --> 04:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
examination of the Animals by a
 
04:18:19.830 --> 04:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
veterinarian licensed under
 
04:18:22.389 --> 04:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
332b of his or her choice at the expense
 
04:18:24.630 --> 04:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
of the person charged they may not know
 
04:18:26.910 --> 04:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
that they can do that and that's why we
 
04:18:30.070 --> 04:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
need to specify that the person when
 
04:18:33.550 --> 04:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
they are charged with abuse or neglect
 
04:18:35.630 --> 04:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
they should be told by the arresting
 
04:18:38.429 --> 04:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
officer that they have the ability to
 
04:18:40.189 --> 04:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
make this
 
04:18:42.189 --> 04:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
petition because they might not they
 
04:18:44.990 --> 04:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
most people wouldn't even know and so
 
04:18:47.550 --> 04:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
they would think that um well whoever
 
04:18:50.070 --> 04:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
the veterinarian is that showed up to
 
04:18:51.109 --> 04:18:51.119 align:start position:0%
assess the
 
04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
situation um you
 
04:18:56.550 --> 04:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
know might be all well and good but they
 
04:18:57.950 --> 04:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
might want to have their own
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarian to come and um and say you
 
04:19:05.189 --> 04:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
know what happened or what didn't happen
 
04:19:07.510 --> 04:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
or the condition of the animal to report
 
04:19:10.510 --> 04:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
on that perfect thank
 
04:19:13.670 --> 04:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
you uh representative King
 
04:19:16.469 --> 04:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chair um another
 
04:19:18.670 --> 04:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
question you're talking about the one
 
04:19:22.109 --> 04:19:22.119 align:start position:0%
section where it says that if an animal
 
04:19:24.710 --> 04:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
is seized and it can't be taken care of
 
04:19:26.109 --> 04:19:26.119 align:start position:0%
by the state because maybe they don't
 
04:19:28.389 --> 04:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
have the facilities or the setup you
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
can't just euthanize the
 
04:19:35.389 --> 04:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
animal and I'm curious um what then you
 
04:19:36.870 --> 04:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
know cuz like when it comes to like
 
04:19:39.229 --> 04:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
children oftentimes when children are
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
taken from parents they're given to
 
04:19:43.750 --> 04:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
grandparents they're given to
 
04:19:46.389 --> 04:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
uncles or somebody close in the family
 
04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
they're given to another person that
 
04:19:50.950 --> 04:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't work for the State but has the
 
04:19:52.870 --> 04:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
capability of helping to raise the child
 
04:19:54.910 --> 04:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
while there's some litigation going on
 
04:19:57.950 --> 04:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if you imagine the
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
idea of let's say some animals are taken
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
instead of the state killing them and
 
04:20:03.910 --> 04:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
instead of the state always having the
 
04:20:05.590 --> 04:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
ability to take care of all different
 
04:20:09.349 --> 04:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
animals they find another farmer that
 
04:20:11.429 --> 04:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
does take care of those specific animals
 
04:20:14.469 --> 04:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
and and if the farmer is willing to take
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
them for the time being I'm just trying
 
04:20:18.990 --> 04:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
to wrap my head around what would happen
 
04:20:20.670 --> 04:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
if they don't kill the animals and the
 
04:20:22.429 --> 04:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
state doesn't have the ability to take
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
care of them what what then do you do
 
04:20:26.670 --> 04:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
well I think they would they would be
 
04:20:32.070 --> 04:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
able to um be able to find a place that
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
would take care of them or they could
 
04:20:36.429 --> 04:20:36.439 align:start position:0%
leave them U you know at the farm that
 
04:20:40.950 --> 04:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
they're at or with a nearby farmer or
 
04:20:43.070 --> 04:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
whoever there I'm sure that they would
 
04:20:45.990 --> 04:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
be able to find a place uh where they
 
04:20:47.790 --> 04:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
would be able to be taken care of
 
04:20:51.149 --> 04:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
properly I mean that's part of the part
 
04:20:54.590 --> 04:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:57.670 --> 04:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
seizure represent Scag thank thank you
 
04:21:01.149 --> 04:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um regarding the cost of care
 
04:21:04.469 --> 04:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
of the animals uh is that borne by the
 
04:21:07.070 --> 04:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
state uh and if somebody petitioned the
 
04:21:09.109 --> 04:21:09.119 align:start position:0%
court and they were found not guilty of
 
04:21:09.119 --> 04:21:10.590 align:start position:0%
court and they were found not guilty of
animal

04:21:10.590 --> 04:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
animal
 
04:21:13.550 --> 04:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
cruy um again it seems like they should
 
04:21:16.670 --> 04:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
not be charged for the cost of that and
 
04:21:18.389 --> 04:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
on the other hand if they were guilty of
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty would it be reasonable
 
04:21:21.630 --> 04:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
for the state to charge them for the
 
04:21:23.109 --> 04:21:23.119 align:start position:0%
cost of care and cre the animal I
 
04:21:25.070 --> 04:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
believe with regarding cost of care
 
04:21:27.030 --> 04:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
issues the best person to answer that
 
04:21:29.469 --> 04:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
question would be our Commissioner of
 
04:21:33.269 --> 04:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and uh and I know we did um
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
we did dispense with a bill this uh this
 
04:21:38.189 --> 04:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
morning having to do with cost of care
 
04:21:42.149 --> 04:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
so that's an issue too that may uh may
 
04:21:44.550 --> 04:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
have some bearing with this bill as we
 
04:21:46.189 --> 04:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
work through the amendment
 
04:21:50.469 --> 04:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:53.469 --> 04:21:53.479 align:start position:0%
you uh yes represent
 
04:21:55.830 --> 04:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you Mr chair I know we want
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
to get through this because there's a
 
04:21:58.149 --> 04:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
lot of other people I'm not I'm not
 
04:21:59.670 --> 04:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
rushing I just I just want to make sure
 
04:22:01.510 --> 04:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
that I get everyone who wants to have a
 
04:22:03.710 --> 04:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
question I want to go back just a little
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
bit to um the question the line of
 
04:22:08.910 --> 04:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
questioning that representative King had
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
in regards with um
 
04:22:16.910 --> 04:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
this H I don't know um what do you call
 
04:22:20.790 --> 04:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
it um profiting on um you know prior to
 
04:22:22.150 --> 04:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
a conviction
 
04:22:22.160 --> 04:22:23.630 align:start position:0%
a conviction
[Music]

04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:22:26.030 --> 04:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:22:28.710 --> 04:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
just I think it I I think it makes sense
 
04:22:31.030 --> 04:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
to be in there I just I wonder know how
 
04:22:35.149 --> 04:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:35.159 --> 04:22:36.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:22:36.750 --> 04:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:39.910 --> 04:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh police that like I I just you know
 
04:22:43.389 --> 04:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
what I mean like and I I have a hard
 
04:22:46.630 --> 04:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
time for example um people like to take
 
04:22:48.429 --> 04:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
matters in their own hands and they get
 
04:22:51.870 --> 04:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
upset about you know abuse especially um
 
04:22:55.510 --> 04:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
there was a case um that had to do with
 
04:22:59.590 --> 04:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
great danes um in the state and um I
 
04:23:03.189 --> 04:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
remember receiving a social media post
 
04:23:06.429 --> 04:23:06.439 align:start position:0%
um that was um you know in a sense kind
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
of threatening to the PE those people
 
04:23:12.550 --> 04:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
and um you know take action now you know
 
04:23:15.630 --> 04:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
shut these people down type of thing and
 
04:23:17.590 --> 04:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
04:23:21.550 --> 04:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
just like what would you first see as
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
like how like who would that then get
 
04:23:26.429 --> 04:23:26.439 align:start position:0%
reported to the same kind of like in the
 
04:23:32.030 --> 04:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
same um space as um the animal cruelty
 
04:23:34.030 --> 04:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
folks to say okay there's you know
 
04:23:36.510 --> 04:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
there's a group over here that's um
 
04:23:38.070 --> 04:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
nobody's been convicted yet and they
 
04:23:41.070 --> 04:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
need to um they're trying to rile it up
 
04:23:42.550 --> 04:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
whether it be you know not just just
 
04:23:44.109 --> 04:23:44.119 align:start position:0%
fundraising but there's a lot of other
 
04:23:46.590 --> 04:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
stuff that happens too as well so I just
 
04:23:49.469 --> 04:23:49.479 align:start position:0%
don't know how that would work I want to
 
04:23:52.030 --> 04:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
just kind of understand well I think
 
04:23:55.309 --> 04:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
that you know um those kind of social
 
04:23:55.319 --> 04:23:56.590 align:start position:0%
that you know um those kind of social
media

04:23:56.590 --> 04:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
media
 
04:23:56.600 --> 04:24:00.870 align:start position:0%
media
pieces

04:24:00.870 --> 04:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:04.950 --> 04:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
um I guess we we we would have some
 
04:24:07.349 --> 04:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
folks who would be involved in the in
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
the situation who would um be aware of
 
04:24:13.389 --> 04:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
some of those fun raising efforts going
 
04:24:16.670 --> 04:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
on and perhaps report it I mean I don't
 
04:24:18.030 --> 04:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
know I mean that's something I think
 
04:24:21.469 --> 04:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
that we have to work through um and
 
04:24:23.550 --> 04:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
clarify yeah so there could just be like
 
04:24:26.070 --> 04:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
a reporting mechanism you know like you
 
04:24:28.149 --> 04:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
make a report to the AG we could you
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
could make a report to whatever the
 
04:24:32.910 --> 04:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
investigating entity for this to say Hey
 
04:24:34.229 --> 04:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
you know this person's doing that or
 
04:24:36.149 --> 04:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
whatever they should probably you know
 
04:24:38.429 --> 04:24:38.439 align:start position:0%
you should probably nip that in the bud
 
04:24:40.910 --> 04:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
type of thing I think you know the the
 
04:24:43.469 --> 04:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
wording itself I mean we were just very
 
04:24:45.189 --> 04:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
concerned that there were people who
 
04:24:47.910 --> 04:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
were profiting off of these incidences
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
and we don't believe that people or
 
04:24:53.830 --> 04:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
organizations should profit off of these
 
04:24:56.950 --> 04:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
things that happen yeah I agree thank
 
04:24:59.349 --> 04:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions for
 
04:24:59.359 --> 04:25:01.910 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions for
representative

04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:05.149 --> 04:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
Aaron thank you representative Aon you
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
and next I'd like to call uh
 
04:25:18.990 --> 04:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:20.550 --> 04:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:25:22.550 --> 04:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
committee I am Sean Jasper commissioner
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Agriculture markets
 
04:25:26.830 --> 04:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
and food I was involved in the early
 
04:25:29.990 --> 04:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
drafting of this legislation um but not
 
04:25:32.269 --> 04:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
to the end um I think this is a very
 
04:25:33.670 --> 04:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
important piece of
 
04:25:36.990 --> 04:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
legislation um but I do have some some
 
04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
concerns about some of the the Drafting
 
04:25:42.990 --> 04:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
and I do intend to be here um tomorrow
 
04:25:45.710 --> 04:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
your work session and hopefully might be
 
04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
able to uh to help there because I do
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
have to get to London der for previous
 
04:25:53.710 --> 04:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
engagement on a AGR tourism issue at an
 
04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
apple orchard for three o'clock so um on
 
04:25:58.680 --> 04:26:00.790 align:start position:0%
apple orchard for three o'clock so um on

Roman
 
04:26:04.870 --> 04:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
4 uh A1 line six the first
 
04:26:07.389 --> 04:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
page while I've believe very much that
 
04:26:09.790 --> 04:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
there should be someone there the state
 
04:26:11.710 --> 04:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
veterinarian or is design and and first
 
04:26:13.630 --> 04:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
of all I want to say the intent was not
 
04:26:16.109 --> 04:26:16.119 align:start position:0%
that the design necessarily be a
 
04:26:17.429 --> 04:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
veterinarian because that's going to
 
04:26:19.510 --> 04:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
really limit the ability would be
 
04:26:22.469 --> 04:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
somebody who had been chosen in advance
 
04:26:23.950 --> 04:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
um we had been talking about working
 
04:26:26.790 --> 04:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
with Farm Bureau to develop a list of
 
04:26:28.670 --> 04:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
people who might be able to provide
 
04:26:30.790 --> 04:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
expertise and that's part of the issue
 
04:26:33.750 --> 04:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
is why um the indemnification is in
 
04:26:36.269 --> 04:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
there but I do believe there should be
 
04:26:38.429 --> 04:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
an exception and I I would just say
 
04:26:40.990 --> 04:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
except when the officer believes that
 
04:26:43.550 --> 04:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
the animals life is an immediate danger
 
04:26:44.910 --> 04:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
and remember there's already a court
 
04:26:47.750 --> 04:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
order in place for these seizures
 
04:26:51.750 --> 04:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
they've already gone there and 247 365
 
04:26:53.590 --> 04:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
days a year you're not always going to
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
be able to get the veterinarian or
 
04:26:58.469 --> 04:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
design and if it's obvious that there's
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
an immediate danger there needs to be an
 
04:27:02.590 --> 04:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
exception so I would suggest you add
 
04:27:05.229 --> 04:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
that uh in
 
04:27:08.189 --> 04:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
6648 Roman 4
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
A2 it currently allows for the owner to
 
04:27:12.469 --> 04:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
petition the court we've talked about
 
04:27:15.469 --> 04:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
that the and that's when charged but if
 
04:27:18.910 --> 04:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
you go to the protective custody it's
 
04:27:21.630 --> 04:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
just an automatic and it doesn't even
 
04:27:24.349 --> 04:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
say when they're charged now obviously
 
04:27:26.349 --> 04:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
if if they show up and they get their
 
04:27:27.590 --> 04:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
animals back they're not going to need
 
04:27:29.750 --> 04:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
to do that but the standard should not
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
be different and I don't I wouldn't care
 
04:27:33.030 --> 04:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's one or the other whether
 
04:27:34.429 --> 04:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
they need a court order or they just
 
04:27:38.269 --> 04:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
have the right to do it but for the one
 
04:27:40.670 --> 04:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
which is a more serious they have to go
 
04:27:41.870 --> 04:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
through the court and for the other it's
 
04:27:44.109 --> 04:27:44.119 align:start position:0%
not automatic so would suggest that that
 
04:27:44.119 --> 04:27:44.870 align:start position:0%
not automatic so would suggest that that
be

04:27:44.870 --> 04:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:27:48.149 --> 04:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
standardized um page two lines
 
04:27:54.070 --> 04:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
36 and Page Three L uh page two line 36
 
04:27:56.910 --> 04:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
page three line one to two negates
 
04:28:00.309 --> 04:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
protective custody by making any such
 
04:28:03.030 --> 04:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
theft um unauthorized theft by
 
04:28:04.510 --> 04:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
unauthorized taking I think that's got
 
04:28:06.070 --> 04:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
to be some sort of a
 
04:28:08.870 --> 04:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
mistake but right the now the way it's
 
04:28:10.990 --> 04:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
written right at the the bottom of the
 
04:28:15.309 --> 04:28:15.319 align:start position:0%
page uh um it does State quite clearly
 
04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
to me that anytime you use protective
 
04:28:20.149 --> 04:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
custody then it's theft by unauthorized
 
04:28:22.990 --> 04:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
taking the unauthorized taking uh or
 
04:28:25.389 --> 04:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
excuse me the protective custody is a
 
04:28:27.309 --> 04:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
section that I think has led to the
 
04:28:28.990 --> 04:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
problem particularly in Lee because no
 
04:28:32.149 --> 04:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
charges were filed that was only
 
04:28:35.870 --> 04:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
intended to be when no one was there and
 
04:28:38.990 --> 04:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
the animals were in immediate danger of
 
04:28:42.109 --> 04:28:42.119 align:start position:0%
not being fed watered um not that
 
04:28:43.389 --> 04:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
somebody was there and they've decided
 
04:28:45.750 --> 04:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
to take them into protective custody so
 
04:28:48.830 --> 04:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
the the language clarifying that is very
 
04:28:50.990 --> 04:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
important um and there does need to be
 
04:28:53.590 --> 04:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
the ability of it and you'd say well why
 
04:28:56.189 --> 04:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
might you need to use that all right
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
you'd been in an automobile accident had
 
04:29:00.269 --> 04:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
a heart attack something happened you're
 
04:29:02.389 --> 04:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
unconscious you're in the hospital you
 
04:29:05.149 --> 04:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
have nobody to take care of your animals
 
04:29:07.550 --> 04:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
and no way of contacting anybody and
 
04:29:09.790 --> 04:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
your neighbors say Hey you know Sean's
 
04:29:11.670 --> 04:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
not home and his animals are starving to
 
04:29:11.680 --> 04:29:13.030 align:start position:0%
not home and his animals are starving to
death

04:29:13.030 --> 04:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
death
 
04:29:15.070 --> 04:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a mechanism for those
 
04:29:16.750 --> 04:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
animals to be taken into protected
 
04:29:20.670 --> 04:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
custody that's why this section in my uh
 
04:29:23.870 --> 04:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
my opinion is so important to have but
 
04:29:26.389 --> 04:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
also there as a result charges could
 
04:29:32.070 --> 04:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
still be uh leveled levied um but it's
 
04:29:34.590 --> 04:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
not necessarily an abuse or neglect case
 
04:29:38.229 --> 04:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
on purpose so there is some U there are
 
04:29:40.550 --> 04:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
some circumstances that make that
 
04:29:42.790 --> 04:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
necessary to have in there
 
04:29:46.830 --> 04:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
and again on page um page three lines 20
 
04:29:49.910 --> 04:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
to 23 does not provide for emergency
 
04:29:54.670 --> 04:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
action by the police police um and I
 
04:29:57.030 --> 04:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not sure that that even needs
 
04:30:00.429 --> 04:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
to be in there because when it rises to
 
04:30:02.670 --> 04:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
a case of protective
 
04:30:05.030 --> 04:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
custody then the individual being
 
04:30:07.950 --> 04:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
charged falls back to the the first
 
04:30:11.030 --> 04:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
instance of them being able to uh be
 
04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
notified because charges would be filed
 
04:30:14.030 --> 04:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
they'd be notified that they could have
 
04:30:18.149 --> 04:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
an a veterinarian inspect the animals so
 
04:30:19.790 --> 04:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
overall it's a very good bill I think
 
04:30:23.070 --> 04:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
there are our problems um that need to
 
04:30:25.830 --> 04:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
be addressed and I look forward to being
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
able to work with the committee on on
 
04:30:30.109 --> 04:30:30.119 align:start position:0%
that I'll be glad to take any any
 
04:30:32.910 --> 04:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
questions at this time representative
 
04:30:35.429 --> 04:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you Mr chair I just have two
 
04:30:38.030 --> 04:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
questions pretty quick it was based upon
 
04:30:39.469 --> 04:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
the points that you made so that would
 
04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
be page two um
 
04:30:45.590 --> 04:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
lines like 35 36 that continue to the
 
04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
next page and then the ones that you
 
04:30:51.830 --> 04:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
just mentioned on page three um
 
04:30:55.990 --> 04:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
2021-22 so are you saying that
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
um that's just written wrong the
 
04:30:59.910 --> 04:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
confiscation of an animal without the
 
04:31:03.030 --> 04:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
charging of the owner under paragraph um
 
04:31:05.070 --> 04:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
four the determination that the animals
 
04:31:07.590 --> 04:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
Animal should be taken into temporary
 
04:31:09.269 --> 04:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
protective custody under this paragraph
 
04:31:11.590 --> 04:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
shall be theft by unauthorized taking
 
04:31:15.469 --> 04:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
under RSA are you just saying that that
 
04:31:17.910 --> 04:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's um personally I don't believe
 
04:31:20.990 --> 04:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
that that belongs there at all because
 
04:31:23.790 --> 04:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
if you're taking into protective custody
 
04:31:26.349 --> 04:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
they're leaving you a note telling you
 
04:31:28.269 --> 04:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
where you can go get your animal back
 
04:31:30.269 --> 04:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
you can get it back unless charges a
 
04:31:32.950 --> 04:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
file I do think that perhaps there
 
04:31:36.149 --> 04:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
should be a further um clarification in
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
that area and I would say on U page two
 
04:31:46.269 --> 04:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
lines 25 26 mhm it probably should be
 
04:31:49.990 --> 04:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
clear that the animals shall be returned
 
04:31:52.149 --> 04:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
unless charges are
 
04:31:55.109 --> 04:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
filed and right now it says the
 
04:31:57.070 --> 04:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
procedure to have the animal returned
 
04:31:58.830 --> 04:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
and any other relevant information that
 
04:32:02.189 --> 04:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
sort of leaves it open-ended perhaps to
 
04:32:03.910 --> 04:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
the average person going well what's the
 
04:32:05.870 --> 04:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
procedure I have to go through with this
 
04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
case the only procedure should be where
 
04:32:10.870 --> 04:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
do you get them and when can you get
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
them but I but I just I think it would
 
04:32:16.189 --> 04:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
help if it clarified that they will get
 
04:32:18.229 --> 04:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
them back unless the police have decided
 
04:32:19.750 --> 04:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
to file
 
04:32:22.030 --> 04:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
charges um
 
04:32:24.830 --> 04:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
followup yes
 
04:32:28.349 --> 04:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
okay okay I think that's great um would
 
04:32:30.710 --> 04:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
you be okay with it I think that the
 
04:32:32.510 --> 04:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
whole point of that being in there is
 
04:32:35.830 --> 04:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
just more of a uh enforcement statement
 
04:32:39.429 --> 04:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
so um so let's say if it is put up near
 
04:32:42.349 --> 04:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
where on page two line um
 
04:32:43.950 --> 04:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
you know about getting them back and all
 
04:32:47.189 --> 04:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
of that that do do you mind it just
 
04:32:49.389 --> 04:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
basically saying that of course you know
 
04:32:53.149 --> 04:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
any animals um that were taken
 
04:32:56.790 --> 04:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
underneath you know RSA 63
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
6373 Blah Blah Blah by any means would
 
04:33:02.550 --> 04:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
be considered that theft by unauthorized
 
04:33:04.189 --> 04:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
taking just to have that statement in
 
04:33:07.551 --> 04:33:07.561 align:start position:0%
there as I don't I don't understand the
 
04:33:09.349 --> 04:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which you could take an
 
04:33:12.390 --> 04:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
animal into protective custody oh and
 
04:33:15.750 --> 04:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
then say but that was theft oh I see I I
 
04:33:17.230 --> 04:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
don't I I think those so that would have
 
04:33:19.310 --> 04:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
to be in a different section of the bill
 
04:33:21.029 --> 04:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
I don't think that I don't think there
 
04:33:24.750 --> 04:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
are any circumstances where if it's true
 
04:33:26.310 --> 04:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
the animal was taken into protective
 
04:33:29.429 --> 04:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
custody then it was returned how could
 
04:33:31.590 --> 04:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
you then say it was theft by
 
04:33:33.551 --> 04:33:33.561 align:start position:0%
unauthorized taking because it was taken
 
04:33:35.590 --> 04:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
in to protect the C it was taken similar
 
04:33:37.029 --> 04:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
to somebody who's taken off the street
 
04:33:39.709 --> 04:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
for being intoxicated they're not
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
charged they sober up the police let
 
04:33:44.269 --> 04:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
them go without charges that's the
 
04:33:46.590 --> 04:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
purpose of protective custody to protect
 
04:33:50.310 --> 04:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
the animal and I think other than when
 
04:33:53.830 --> 04:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
an owner is just being negligent and not
 
04:33:55.869 --> 04:33:55.879 align:start position:0%
feeding watering the animal taking care
 
04:33:58.109 --> 04:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
of them they're not around they need to
 
04:34:01.070 --> 04:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
be taken but ultimately charges need to
 
04:34:05.750 --> 04:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
be done need to be filed right uh I'm
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
just going to take a a little bit of a u
 
04:34:11.230 --> 04:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
make a little uh question about that
 
04:34:14.310 --> 04:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
part but so I believe that the intent in
 
04:34:19.551 --> 04:34:19.561 align:start position:0%
that uh section was that uh it would be
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh taking animals is acceptable if there
 
04:34:24.949 --> 04:34:24.959 align:start position:0%
is a charge taking animals is acceptable
 
04:34:27.990 --> 04:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
if it's protective custody if neither of
 
04:34:30.869 --> 04:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
those cases is the is
 
04:34:35.230 --> 04:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
uh is it applies then it would be theft
 
04:34:38.189 --> 04:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
and uh so I I do you see that that that
 
04:34:39.949 --> 04:34:39.959 align:start position:0%
the way it's currently expressed doesn't
 
04:34:43.750 --> 04:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
Express that clearly I think it it
 
04:34:47.590 --> 04:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't but um I I do think that e
 
04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
covers both you know just the first part
 
04:34:52.029 --> 04:34:52.039 align:start position:0%
of that the confiscation of an animal
 
04:34:54.750 --> 04:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
without the charging of the owner under
 
04:34:57.510 --> 04:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph five uh
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
four you
 
04:35:03.189 --> 04:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
know shall be theft by unauthorized
 
04:35:04.590 --> 04:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
taking and I think this gets back to the
 
04:35:07.670 --> 04:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
Lee case where the owner was not charged
 
04:35:10.830 --> 04:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
and everyone seemed to think that they
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
the police were used using the
 
04:35:14.189 --> 04:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
protective custody which I think even
 
04:35:15.470 --> 04:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
the police may have thought they were
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
using but it it should not have applied
 
04:35:19.629 --> 04:35:19.639 align:start position:0%
and that's why this needs to be
 
04:35:21.990 --> 04:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
clarified and that led to the problem if
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
you clar clarify that I don't think
 
04:35:26.109 --> 04:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to end up in the same
 
04:35:28.390 --> 04:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
situation ever again thank you I I think
 
04:35:29.869 --> 04:35:29.879 align:start position:0%
that what we're getting we're we're
 
04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
getting into a sort of a redrafting mode
 
04:35:33.150 --> 04:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
here which I don't think we need to be
 
04:35:35.070 --> 04:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
doing in a hearing so let's let's move
 
04:35:36.869 --> 04:35:36.879 align:start position:0%
move on representative
 
04:35:39.789 --> 04:35:39.799 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you Mr chair c could you
 
04:35:42.510 --> 04:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
please briefly Explain how how um you
 
04:35:46.109 --> 04:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
handle the costs that are sure so
 
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
anytime animals are seized and only when
 
04:35:50.070 --> 04:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
they're seized not when they're taken
 
04:35:52.150 --> 04:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
into protective custody and not when
 
04:35:55.150 --> 04:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
they are surrendered because often times
 
04:35:57.629 --> 04:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
what happens is the police come in and
 
04:36:00.230 --> 04:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
will say you're going to if you don't
 
04:36:02.551 --> 04:36:02.561 align:start position:0%
surrender your animals or some number of
 
04:36:05.590 --> 04:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
them you will be charged so if they
 
04:36:07.949 --> 04:36:07.959 align:start position:0%
surrender them then that is off the cost
 
04:36:10.789 --> 04:36:10.799 align:start position:0%
of care fund but when the police sees
 
04:36:12.629 --> 04:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
the animals
 
04:36:14.709 --> 04:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh the cost of care fund is responsible
 
04:36:16.470 --> 04:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
for the care the reasonable care of
 
04:36:20.590 --> 04:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
those animals until the court case is
 
04:36:22.510 --> 04:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicated and there are just to
 
04:36:25.590 --> 04:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
clarify there are times too when they
 
04:36:27.349 --> 04:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
may surrender a certain number of
 
04:36:29.551 --> 04:36:29.561 align:start position:0%
animals and another number of animals
 
04:36:30.390 --> 04:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
may be
 
04:36:33.230 --> 04:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
seized and they're still charged but the
 
04:36:35.150 --> 04:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
number of animals may be reduced so it's
 
04:36:37.551 --> 04:36:37.561 align:start position:0%
it gets very complicated at times
 
04:36:42.629 --> 04:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
followup yes thank you um if a
 
04:36:44.429 --> 04:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
if somebody's convicted of animal
 
04:36:46.750 --> 04:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
cruelty does the state go after them to
 
04:36:48.629 --> 04:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
recover Char uh
 
04:36:52.670 --> 04:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
costes in theory yes so far I haven't
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
seen any money come back into the fund U
 
04:36:56.750 --> 04:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
most of the time those people don't have
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
any money that we can collect but that
 
04:37:02.070 --> 04:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
is the theory uh and it is in in the
 
04:37:04.189 --> 04:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
cost of care statute that if they're
 
04:37:05.949 --> 04:37:05.959 align:start position:0%
convicted they would be responsible to
 
04:37:08.470 --> 04:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
reimburse the fund thank
 
04:37:10.789 --> 04:37:10.799 align:start position:0%
you are there any more questions for the
 
04:37:10.799 --> 04:37:13.029 align:start position:0%
you are there any more questions for the
commissioner

04:37:13.029 --> 04:37:13.039 align:start position:0%

confirmation milk quality and
 
04:39:36.830 --> 04:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
quantity when we started the farm we
 
04:39:38.910 --> 04:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
wanted people to come and visit us our
 
04:39:41.990 --> 04:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
farm has always been an open Farm
 
04:39:44.550 --> 04:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
over the years we have hosted many Tours

School children tours birthday parties
 
04:39:49.628 --> 04:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
Etc it was important to us to invite
 
04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
people to learn about goats about
 
04:39:55.550 --> 04:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
farming and the quality of
 
04:39:59.390 --> 04:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
food on April 29th a woman
 
04:40:02.430 --> 04:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
came and walked all over remember it's
 
04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
an open Farm she sent me a scathing
 
04:40:08.590 --> 04:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
email about our farm I emailed her back
 
04:40:10.628 --> 04:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
and invited her to take a tour with me
 
04:40:13.190 --> 04:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
so we could just discuss her concerns
 
04:40:15.430 --> 04:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
she did not respond to me and contacted
 
04:40:17.150 --> 04:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
the sbca
 
04:40:20.590 --> 04:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
instead on May 1st an inspector and
 
04:40:22.868 --> 04:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
Associate showed up and asked to look
 
04:40:26.948 --> 04:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
around I said of course they did and
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
left then on May 10th the inspector and
 
04:40:31.910 --> 04:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
one of their vets showed up with a
 
04:40:34.830 --> 04:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
police chief and many people and
 
04:40:37.350 --> 04:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles I was completely knocked off
 
04:40:39.750 --> 04:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
guard I couldn't think of or comprehend
 
04:40:42.510 --> 04:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
what was going on the police said I had
 
04:40:44.470 --> 04:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
to sign a search warrant if I didn't he
 
04:40:45.670 --> 04:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
would arrest
 
04:40:48.550 --> 04:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
me they proceeded to move my goats all
 
04:40:50.910 --> 04:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
around and said that I had to kill five
 
04:40:54.948 --> 04:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
ladies we call our female goats ladies
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
they were here as grandmas they were our
 
04:41:00.390 --> 04:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
oldest to our kids kids being the baby
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
goats there was nothing wrong with them
 
04:41:05.670 --> 04:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
except age the vet wanted to take one of
 
04:41:09.390 --> 04:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
our black kids little baby goat he was
 
04:41:11.628 --> 04:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
perfect and would follow me all around I
 
04:41:15.910 --> 04:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
asked why she said he had a thin
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
neck also they wanted to take a
 
04:41:21.430 --> 04:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
month-old white kid that was very thin I
 
04:41:23.470 --> 04:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
asked them not to take him as I had him
 
04:41:26.190 --> 04:41:26.200 align:start position:0%
on a special milk diet of goat milk
 
04:41:29.190 --> 04:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
colostrum and goat milk replacer he was
 
04:41:32.310 --> 04:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
born thin and was doing well they said
 
04:41:34.430 --> 04:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
they knew what they were doing they said
 
04:41:36.390 --> 04:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
I had until May
 
04:41:38.948 --> 04:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
24th to do their
 
04:41:42.550 --> 04:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations they showed up May
 
04:41:45.190 --> 04:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
21st in the report the vet said that the
 
04:41:47.310 --> 04:41:47.320 align:start position:0%
goats were walking around on their knees
 
04:41:47.320 --> 04:41:48.390 align:start position:0%
goats were walking around on their knees
probably

04:41:48.390 --> 04:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
probably
 
04:41:52.590 --> 04:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
CAE if it were CAE which causes lame and
 
04:41:55.270 --> 04:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
sore knees they would not be walking
 
04:41:56.948 --> 04:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
around on
 
04:42:03.110 --> 04:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
them CAE is a caprine arthritic in
 
04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
incilius and it is commonly thought of
 
04:42:10.150 --> 04:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
being in probably 20% of all
 
04:42:12.470 --> 04:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
goats and there are two schools of
 
04:42:15.150 --> 04:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
thought about that is to whether you
 
04:42:18.230 --> 04:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
euthanize them once you have them tested
 
04:42:22.510 --> 04:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
as little kids or you raise them up now
 
04:42:25.190 --> 04:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
if a goat's in pain a goat's going to
 
04:42:27.830 --> 04:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
grind its teeth and you know you've got
 
04:42:30.270 --> 04:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
a problem and then you make a
 
04:42:33.430 --> 04:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
decision usually with a CAE goat they
 
04:42:36.788 --> 04:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
may not show any
 
04:42:41.590 --> 04:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
um issues until they're 8 years old
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's the that's with a Dr George our
 
04:42:48.070 --> 04:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
vet that's what we practice that we do
 
04:42:51.670 --> 04:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
with the 8-year-old goats on May 24th
 
04:42:54.590 --> 04:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
1st I had just finished having a tour
 
04:42:57.030 --> 04:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
with 20 kindergarten kids and Was
 
04:42:59.190 --> 04:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
preparing for the next group of kids
 
04:43:01.990 --> 04:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
when I looked up and there was the SPCA
 
04:43:06.470 --> 04:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
with cars many people police and horse
 
04:43:09.510 --> 04:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
trailer I told her I had a tour and she
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
said cancel it
 
04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
they proceeded to take 52 goats now at
 
04:43:16.708 --> 04:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
this point will be 54 they've taken the
 
04:43:19.110 --> 04:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
goats were screaming the police would
 
04:43:21.430 --> 04:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
not let me near them to comfort them
 
04:43:24.788 --> 04:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
saying I would tamper with evidence he
 
04:43:27.708 --> 04:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
pulled on my clothes sprained my wrist
 
04:43:29.750 --> 04:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
would not leave me alone he stayed one
 
04:43:32.708 --> 04:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
foot from me I kept pleading with him to
 
04:43:35.270 --> 04:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
stop and he would not I have never
 
04:43:38.430 --> 04:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
experienced such brutality in my life I
 
04:43:40.590 --> 04:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
was just scared I was so scared I could
 
04:43:43.390 --> 04:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
hardly breathe as I said the goats were
 
04:43:45.550 --> 04:43:45.560 align:start position:0%
scared and screaming they had locked the
 
04:43:48.550 --> 04:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
goats in a small stall for a man
 
04:43:54.310 --> 04:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:59.670 --> 04:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
them to the trailer we had we have 11
 
04:44:03.030 --> 04:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
stalls for the ladies to choose where
 
04:44:05.910 --> 04:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
they want to spend time which is about
 
04:44:11.150 --> 04:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
2100 Square ft of open stall space
 
04:44:13.750 --> 04:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
also we practice winter pack stall
 
04:44:16.030 --> 04:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
treatment which means that we allow the
 
04:44:18.310 --> 04:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
bedding of fresh hay to build up to two
 
04:44:21.550 --> 04:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
or so feet every winter we start
 
04:44:24.350 --> 04:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
building this winter pack in August so
 
04:44:26.550 --> 04:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
by the time we have bit bitter cold
 
04:44:28.150 --> 04:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
weather the pack will be a couple of
 
04:44:30.430 --> 04:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
feet thick in the spring they are
 
04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
cleaned out to the gravel this year our
 
04:44:35.070 --> 04:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
skid steer was being repaired and we had
 
04:44:36.510 --> 04:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
started to clean a stall with a
 
04:44:38.590 --> 04:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
wheelbarrow that is the stall the
 
04:44:41.350 --> 04:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
inspectors chose to use it was also Al a
 
04:44:44.470 --> 04:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
93° day and with all their weight on the
 
04:44:46.430 --> 04:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
winter pack and all the goats the odor
 
04:44:48.990 --> 04:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
was strong they were asked to move by
 
04:44:51.550 --> 04:44:51.560 align:start position:0%
one of our farm team and they ignored
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
her one of our ladies a milka was being
 
04:44:56.190 --> 04:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
hauled up to the trailer by having her
 
04:44:58.628 --> 04:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
front legs pulled and then another
 
04:45:01.030 --> 04:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
person picked up her back legs they
 
04:45:03.948 --> 04:45:03.958 align:start position:0%
would not let her walk she was one of 10
 
04:45:06.788 --> 04:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
milkers that they took I asked what they
 
04:45:08.670 --> 04:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
were going to do with the milk they said
 
04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
they have no one to milk so they let
 
04:45:13.270 --> 04:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
these sweet ladies dry up in pain and
 
04:45:13.280 --> 04:45:13.948 align:start position:0%
these sweet ladies dry up in pain and
get

04:45:13.948 --> 04:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:45:16.510 --> 04:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
mastitis they took my sarn and buck that
 
04:45:17.670 --> 04:45:17.680 align:start position:0%

04:45:22.430 --> 04:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
throws of kidding and she was fighting
 
04:45:25.350 --> 04:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
ketosis I had her on a molasses in water
 
04:45:28.550 --> 04:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
every hour schedule they took her I
 
04:45:30.590 --> 04:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
asked them not to touch her she was
 
04:45:33.310 --> 04:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
resting and beginning to turn around
 
04:45:35.350 --> 04:45:35.360 align:start position:0%

04:45:51.190 --> 04:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
five grandmas we have six large water
 
04:45:53.670 --> 04:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
troughs that are filled every day there
 
04:45:56.110 --> 04:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
are three in the lower barn and three in
 
04:45:58.470 --> 04:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
the upper Barn so water is accessible at
 
04:46:01.670 --> 04:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
all times we had a lady born with bent
 
04:46:05.070 --> 04:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
legs we built her a cradle with PVC pipe
 
04:46:08.070 --> 04:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
in Wheels she didn't like it so she
 
04:46:10.310 --> 04:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
walked around on her knees one of the
 
04:46:12.150 --> 04:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
inspectors saw a goat that we had put
 
04:46:14.190 --> 04:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
down the day before because she was in
 
04:46:16.910 --> 04:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
pain when we put a goat down we put them
 
04:46:18.670 --> 04:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
way down back in a shallow grave for the
 
04:46:21.390 --> 04:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
coyotes to eat they do a great job the
 
04:46:23.190 --> 04:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
bones are then buried in the compost
 
04:46:27.430 --> 04:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
piles to decompose nothing is wasted on
 
04:46:31.190 --> 04:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
May 22nd the white goat was going into K
 
04:46:33.510 --> 04:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
the the white goat that was going into
 
04:46:36.030 --> 04:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
ketosis was not doing well and the
 
04:46:39.350 --> 04:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
inspector called me not emailed me and
 
04:46:41.750 --> 04:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to call Dr George who knows goats
 
04:46:43.990 --> 04:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
he's excellent with goats but I had to
 
04:46:46.750 --> 04:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
give approval I said yes the inspector
 
04:46:49.390 --> 04:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
told me to email that to him and he gave
 
04:46:52.430 --> 04:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
me the words to use I did the next
 
04:46:54.430 --> 04:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
morning I woke up and thought what did I
 
04:46:57.070 --> 04:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
just do he told me to write words that
 
04:46:59.910 --> 04:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
turned all my goats over to them I
 
04:47:02.030 --> 04:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
emailed him and said I take it back he
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
never responded I was so scared frozen
 
04:47:08.190 --> 04:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
invulnerable neither the sbca nor the
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
police would respond to me the sbca took
 
04:47:16.230 --> 04:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
54 goats killed 22 and offered the rest
 
04:47:19.430 --> 04:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:21.830 --> 04:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
$40,000 they said I could buy the son
 
04:47:23.230 --> 04:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
and buck back for
 
04:47:26.990 --> 04:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
$400 but I had to sign a paper that
 
04:47:30.350 --> 04:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
would give them full access to my farm
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
whenever they wanted and do whatever
 
04:47:32.638 --> 04:47:33.708 align:start position:0%
whenever they wanted and do whatever
they

04:47:33.708 --> 04:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:47:36.788 --> 04:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
wanted they gave me a list of 25 goats
 
04:47:38.830 --> 04:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
that were me recommended to be treated
 
04:47:40.510 --> 04:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
either by a vet or have their Hooves
 
04:47:40.520 --> 04:47:41.670 align:start position:0%
either by a vet or have their Hooves
trimmed

04:47:41.670 --> 04:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
trimmed
 
04:47:43.750 --> 04:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
how did they end up taking 52 without
 
04:47:46.670 --> 04:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
any probable cause now as far as the
 
04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
goats hoofs in the winter time we tend
 
04:47:52.788 --> 04:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
not to trim this trim them as much as we
 
04:47:55.070 --> 04:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
would in the summertime I like to call
 
04:47:58.070 --> 04:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
it their ski boots because they the
 
04:48:00.670 --> 04:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
Hooves get thick and when they get thick
 
04:48:02.350 --> 04:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
it gives them a little cushion from the
 
04:48:06.070 --> 04:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
cold from the snow and the the
 
04:48:08.990 --> 04:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
ground they left 30 goats why didn't
 
04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
they take all of my goats if they were
 
04:48:16.190 --> 04:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:19.390 --> 04:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances on June 14th we have a med
 
04:48:22.110 --> 04:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
we had a mediation at the farm it lasted
 
04:48:25.070 --> 04:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
a few hours with no mediation done the
 
04:48:28.510 --> 04:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
sbca would not budge after the sbca
 
04:48:30.910 --> 04:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
price release we got threats one in
 
04:48:32.750 --> 04:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
particular was a threat to spray paint
 
04:48:35.830 --> 04:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
our cars we were scared so I called the
 
04:48:38.270 --> 04:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
police they sent a young cop and he said
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
there wasn't anything they could do and
 
04:48:41.310 --> 04:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
he left
 
04:48:43.708 --> 04:48:43.718 align:start position:0%
also at the end the sbca asked for money
 
04:48:50.070 --> 04:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:53.230 --> 04:48:53.240 align:start position:0%

this is a fairly charged topic we need
 
04:49:38.910 --> 04:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
to be very careful to uh make sure that
 
04:49:41.430 --> 04:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
we are respectful of everyone in the
 
04:49:44.788 --> 04:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
room and that we do not ascribe motive
 
04:49:50.230 --> 04:49:50.240 align:start position:0%

04:49:55.868 --> 04:49:55.878 align:start position:0%
facts of the case and uh which is I I
 
04:49:57.910 --> 04:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to put a damper on anyone
 
04:50:00.590 --> 04:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
Express you know uh presenting any of
 
04:50:01.868 --> 04:50:01.878 align:start position:0%
their evidence but I want to make sure
 
04:50:04.590 --> 04:50:04.600 align:start position:0%
that it is done in a very respectful way
 
04:50:07.430 --> 04:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh so I believe that representative
 
04:50:11.310 --> 04:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
King was next and then uh representative
 
04:50:14.910 --> 04:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
minor and representative uh okay so
 
04:50:17.190 --> 04:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you for your
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
testimony and for taking questions you
 
04:50:21.070 --> 04:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
said there was originally a lady who
 
04:50:24.110 --> 04:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
visited your farm she complained and
 
04:50:26.708 --> 04:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
then uh sometime later another person
 
04:50:29.230 --> 04:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
came was that from the SPCA and you she
 
04:50:30.628 --> 04:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
asked to look around and you said of
 
04:50:32.868 --> 04:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
course or was that from some other
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
organization the lady came walk the farm
 
04:50:37.548 --> 04:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
when I wasn't there because it's an open
 
04:50:41.310 --> 04:50:41.320 align:start position:0%
Farm um and then the sbca showed up okay
 
04:50:43.350 --> 04:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
and and and they asked to look it was
 
04:50:45.670 --> 04:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
the inspector and a person with him I
 
04:50:48.270 --> 04:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
don't know who it was um do you believe
 
04:50:51.110 --> 04:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
that in the future if an spaca person
 
04:50:53.628 --> 04:50:53.638 align:start position:0%
shows up you would deny them access to
 
04:50:56.590 --> 04:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
your farm or do it's a closed Farm now
 
04:50:58.390 --> 04:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's a closed Farm now yeah so are you
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%

could you tell us a little bit I'm
 
04:51:42.708 --> 04:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
reading through some of the documents
 
04:51:46.070 --> 04:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
you shared with us here uh specifically
 
04:51:48.270 --> 04:51:48.280 align:start position:0%

with the vet who who came to the farm
 
04:51:55.070 --> 04:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
because I understand one of the things
 
04:51:56.548 --> 04:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do in this bill is to
 
04:51:59.150 --> 04:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that veterinarians with the
 
04:52:01.110 --> 04:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
applicable expertise are the people who
 
04:52:03.030 --> 04:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
are who are doing the assessment so
 
04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
could you tell us about your interaction
 
04:52:06.590 --> 04:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
with the veterinarian who came out and
 
04:52:08.628 --> 04:52:08.638 align:start position:0%

04:52:39.948 --> 04:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
investigation um well I think there were
 
04:52:42.430 --> 04:52:42.440 align:start position:0%

little kids and then there was another
 
04:53:11.708 --> 04:53:11.718 align:start position:0%
vet I think
 
04:53:14.390 --> 04:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
that um came the next time where they
 
04:53:17.350 --> 04:53:17.360 align:start position:0%

04:54:30.110 --> 04:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you m Mr chair and thank
 
04:54:31.830 --> 04:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
you so much for coming in front of us I
 
04:54:33.548 --> 04:54:33.558 align:start position:0%
know this must be very difficult to keep
 
04:54:36.910 --> 04:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
reliving this um do you and have you
 
04:54:39.110 --> 04:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
looked at the bill I'm sure you have
 
04:54:40.390 --> 04:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
have you looked at this bill that's
 
04:54:40.400 --> 04:54:41.470 align:start position:0%
have you looked at this bill that's
being

04:54:41.470 --> 04:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:54:44.910 --> 04:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
presented yes okay so do you believe
 
04:54:47.628 --> 04:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
that this bill if it had been in place
 
04:54:50.948 --> 04:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
in 2000 when that had occurred on your
 
04:54:54.430 --> 04:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
farm that this bill would have prevented
 
04:54:56.070 --> 04:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
all of that from
 
04:54:58.270 --> 04:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
happening one of the things that I'm
 
04:55:02.948 --> 04:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
concerned about is is um livestock
 
04:55:04.628 --> 04:55:04.638 align:start position:0%
versus domestic
 
04:55:07.470 --> 04:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
animals it has got to be
 
04:55:10.948 --> 04:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
clear um
 
04:55:15.868 --> 04:55:15.878 align:start position:0%
goats are sweet sweet
 
04:55:18.110 --> 04:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
animals they're very
 
04:55:20.830 --> 04:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
friendly and very trusting if they're
 
04:55:22.390 --> 04:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
brought up that
 
04:55:26.310 --> 04:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
way um and if somebody comes in and
 
04:55:28.350 --> 04:55:28.360 align:start position:0%
starts manhandling them they go they go
 
04:55:31.030 --> 04:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
whacky in their heads they just you know
 
04:55:33.270 --> 04:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's pitiful it's a pitiful
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
thing so I think that that has really
 
04:55:36.868 --> 04:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
got to be
 
04:55:41.708 --> 04:55:41.718 align:start position:0%
clarified and the Farms have got to know
 
04:55:44.150 --> 04:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
somehow the farmers have got to know
 
04:55:47.310 --> 04:55:47.320 align:start position:0%
that they do have I didn't know you that
 
04:55:50.868 --> 04:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
there is protection for us as farmers of
 
04:55:50.878 --> 04:55:52.470 align:start position:0%
there is protection for us as farmers of
of

04:55:52.470 --> 04:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:55:56.670 --> 04:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
livestock yes thank you so a a bill a
 
04:55:59.548 --> 04:55:59.558 align:start position:0%
bill like this that would be cified into
 
04:56:01.310 --> 04:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
law would definitely be helpful for
 
04:56:03.990 --> 04:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
Farmers as far as their rights with
 
04:56:06.750 --> 04:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
their farm animals and their domestic
 
04:56:08.868 --> 04:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
animals as well do you agree with that
 
04:56:13.110 --> 04:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:16.548 --> 04:56:16.558 align:start position:0%

as you said it's a very charged case and
 
04:57:14.708 --> 04:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of information that's
 
04:57:16.070 --> 04:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
shared and there's a lot of information
 
04:57:18.270 --> 04:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
that's not shared I I'll just say that
 
04:57:18.280 --> 04:57:18.990 align:start position:0%

as the oldest and largest Humane Society
 
04:57:45.070 --> 04:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire we are in
 
04:57:47.788 --> 04:57:47.798 align:start position:0%
stratum New Hampshire um we were founded
 
04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
in 1872 we take great pride in caring
 
04:57:53.230 --> 04:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
for more than 3,800 animals each year
 
04:57:57.628 --> 04:57:57.638 align:start position:0%
both large and small for more than 150
 
04:57:59.830 --> 04:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
years we've been protecting beasts of
 
04:58:02.390 --> 04:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
Burden those large animals named in our
 
04:58:05.110 --> 04:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
first agents report in
 
04:58:07.990 --> 04:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
1874 we have been protecting horses over
 
04:58:10.390 --> 04:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
burdened starved and left suffering in
 
04:58:12.190 --> 04:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
other words we have a long history of
 
04:58:15.548 --> 04:58:15.558 align:start position:0%
protecting animals in the 31 years that
 
04:58:17.390 --> 04:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
I've been the executive director at the
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:58:22.030 --> 04:58:22.040 align:start position:0%
SPCA I've had four Humane agents
 
04:58:24.750 --> 04:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
employed three of them retired police
 
04:58:27.390 --> 04:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
officers very well versed in the law two
 
04:58:30.628 --> 04:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
of them remain on our staff today and
 
04:58:32.708 --> 04:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from them
 
04:58:36.070 --> 04:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
later this past year we received more
 
04:58:36.080 --> 04:58:37.788 align:start position:0%
later this past year we received more
than

04:58:37.788 --> 04:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:58:40.590 --> 04:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
681 complaints of animal cruelty
 
04:58:42.070 --> 04:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
involving more than
 
04:58:42.080 --> 04:58:43.670 align:start position:0%
involving more than
2600

04:58:43.670 --> 04:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
2600
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
animals of these 191 far more than the
 
04:58:50.830 --> 04:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
50 cited in the financial um
 
04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
impact 191 cases involved 583 animals
 
04:58:59.868 --> 04:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
that were farm animals and equines
 
04:59:02.628 --> 04:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
subsequently 67 were
 
04:59:05.670 --> 04:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
surrendered almost 600 only 67
 
04:59:08.868 --> 04:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
surrendered and 66 were
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
seized when when we receive calls
 
04:59:15.150 --> 04:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
they're investigated by local animal
 
04:59:18.270 --> 04:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
control local police departments and
 
04:59:21.190 --> 04:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
ourselves the goal is
 
04:59:23.830 --> 04:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
education guidelines and resources when
 
04:59:26.110 --> 04:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
needed and only protection in emergent
 
04:59:28.350 --> 04:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
situations we believe strongly that
 
04:59:31.190 --> 04:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
people are truly trying to do their best
 
04:59:34.708 --> 04:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
sadly however sometimes individuals are
 
04:59:37.628 --> 04:59:37.638 align:start position:0%
no longer capable of providing the care
 
04:59:40.470 --> 04:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
and well-meaning Friends May offer
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:48.350 --> 04:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances though cases with live EV
 
04:59:50.190 --> 04:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
evidence are supposed to take precedence
 
04:59:53.070 --> 04:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
on the court system they often take
 
04:59:55.350 --> 04:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
months if not years to resolve
 
04:59:58.670 --> 04:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
themselves boarding and care costs when
 
05:00:00.910 --> 05:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
animals are in protective custody Mount
 
05:00:03.750 --> 05:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
up quickly and become insurmountable to
 
05:00:06.510 --> 05:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
those charged with animal cruelty only a
 
05:00:08.708 --> 05:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago we finally settled a case
 
05:00:13.110 --> 05:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
of 39 animals being taken after 18
 
05:00:15.150 --> 05:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
months so one of the things that was
 
05:00:18.390 --> 05:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
spoken about earlier is fundraising and
 
05:00:20.230 --> 05:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
though we do press releases because the
 
05:00:22.590 --> 05:00:22.600 align:start position:0%
media hears the police reports they come
 
05:00:24.070 --> 05:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
they call us they ask they want to come
 
05:00:26.390 --> 05:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
see the animals and yes we tell them
 
05:00:29.830 --> 05:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
that they can give funding to this uh
 
05:00:32.510 --> 05:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
the cost of not I'm getting cost of care
 
05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
to our first aid fund for
 
05:00:39.030 --> 05:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
animals we can go for years before we
 
05:00:41.030 --> 05:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
receive any funding somebody's got to
 
05:00:43.350 --> 05:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
pay the vet bills the legal fees the
 
05:00:46.030 --> 05:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
care the boarding the Staffing and when
 
05:00:48.190 --> 05:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
people say CU I had a conversation with
 
05:00:51.548 --> 05:00:51.558 align:start position:0%
a chief the other day and he said you
 
05:00:53.350 --> 05:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
know you're able to raise funding I said
 
05:00:55.430 --> 05:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes but I can't repair the injury to my
 
05:00:57.470 --> 05:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
Vette Tech who was mauled by one of the
 
05:00:59.590 --> 05:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
German Shepherds who's now left the
 
05:01:02.470 --> 05:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
industry I can't keep 36 German
 
05:01:04.670 --> 05:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
Shepherds sane in our building for two
 
05:01:06.430 --> 05:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
years while this goes through the court
 
05:01:09.230 --> 05:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
cases it's very difficult The Compassion
 
05:01:10.548 --> 05:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
fatigue is
 
05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
real this past year we removed six
 
05:01:15.510 --> 05:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
horses from a facility the family
 
05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
members who lived across the country
 
05:01:19.070 --> 05:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
were unaware that the owner now living
 
05:01:19.080 --> 05:01:19.830 align:start position:0%
were unaware that the owner now living
with

05:01:19.830 --> 05:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:01:22.350 --> 05:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
dementia we did not charge her with
 
05:01:24.110 --> 05:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
cruelty and I think that's really
 
05:01:26.230 --> 05:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
important to understand our goal is not
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
to V you know to charge people every
 
05:01:32.350 --> 05:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
time when it's unintentional many times
 
05:01:34.868 --> 05:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
most of the time most of the time it's
 
05:01:37.350 --> 05:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
neglect it is not cruelty people aren't
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
actively inflicting harm but they're neg
 
05:01:43.310 --> 05:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
leful it's a it's a little bit like the
 
05:01:47.390 --> 05:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:50.830 --> 05:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
water charging would have been
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
cruel in another case this case that
 
05:01:56.190 --> 05:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking about earlier where the 54
 
05:01:59.830 --> 05:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
goats were removed we had two USDA
 
05:01:59.840 --> 05:02:00.868 align:start position:0%

05:02:03.470 --> 05:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
veterinarians who were accredited for
 
05:02:05.868 --> 05:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
livestock they were not cat vets though
 
05:02:08.430 --> 05:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
they may work with cats as well and the
 
05:02:11.470 --> 05:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
one Dr Boer who was refer earlier for
 
05:02:13.670 --> 05:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
more than seven years was the lead vet
 
05:02:16.430 --> 05:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
in the California state fairs she was
 
05:02:20.110 --> 05:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
very well versed in farm
 
05:02:22.708 --> 05:02:22.718 align:start position:0%
animals the State Vet was there well the
 
05:02:23.948 --> 05:02:23.958 align:start position:0%
State Vet wasn't but two of their
 
05:02:26.150 --> 05:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
technicians was there when they when we
 
05:02:28.510 --> 05:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
arrived and they said oh you've got two
 
05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
vets here we don't need to be here and
 
05:02:31.830 --> 05:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
they left we would have loved for them
 
05:02:35.230 --> 05:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:37.990 --> 05:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
stayed yes 18 animals were euthanized
 
05:02:39.788 --> 05:02:39.798 align:start position:0%
immediately another died on the way to
 
05:02:41.510 --> 05:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
to the vet's
 
05:02:44.830 --> 05:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
practice it was a very dire situation
 
05:02:46.750 --> 05:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
though professional colleagues had Ed a
 
05:02:48.628 --> 05:02:48.638 align:start position:0%
reduction in the herd and euthanizing
 
05:02:51.030 --> 05:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
for those in pain sooner well-meaning
 
05:02:54.150 --> 05:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
was not enough and by the way no animals
 
05:02:55.948 --> 05:02:55.958 align:start position:0%
are castrated no cats and dogs are
 
05:02:57.430 --> 05:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
spayed and neuters when animals are in
 
05:02:59.310 --> 05:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
protective custody when I've testified
 
05:03:01.868 --> 05:03:01.878 align:start position:0%
in the past they've said somebody came
 
05:03:02.830 --> 05:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
up and they said you know they're
 
05:03:04.750 --> 05:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
spaying and neutering all our animals
 
05:03:07.190 --> 05:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
that that's not happening we
 
05:03:09.868 --> 05:03:09.878 align:start position:0%
don't we're we're not allowed by law we
 
05:03:11.830 --> 05:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
can only do Emergency
 
05:03:14.110 --> 05:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
Care the expectation that police
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
departments and Animal Control Officers
 
05:03:18.070 --> 05:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
have expertise required to determine
 
05:03:19.708 --> 05:03:19.718 align:start position:0%
cruelty and neglect is often not
 
05:03:21.708 --> 05:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
realistic there's no certification for
 
05:03:24.110 --> 05:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
Animal Control Officers police officers
 
05:03:25.830 --> 05:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
do not have a specialty in Animal
 
05:03:27.230 --> 05:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
Welfare or
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
husbandry they contact us routinely to
 
05:03:33.110 --> 05:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
provide that expertise this is what we
 
05:03:37.430 --> 05:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
do every day 365 days a year this week
 
05:03:39.788 --> 05:03:39.798 align:start position:0%
we've assisted Alexandria PD Rawlings
 
05:03:41.708 --> 05:03:41.718 align:start position:0%
Spirit at Hampton and the list
 
05:03:44.590 --> 05:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
continues if Lucky they rarely have to
 
05:03:46.548 --> 05:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
deal with animal cases and quite frankly
 
05:03:47.788 --> 05:03:47.798 align:start position:0%
they don't want
 
05:03:51.150 --> 05:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
to it's fear of what will they do with
 
05:03:53.110 --> 05:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
the animals honestly what will they do
 
05:03:54.830 --> 05:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
with the animals when they seize them
 
05:03:55.990 --> 05:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
where are they going to go and they take
 
05:03:57.350 --> 05:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
them into protective custody where are
 
05:03:59.070 --> 05:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
they going to go if you're not allowing
 
05:04:01.030 --> 05:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
our Humane agents to be on the property
 
05:04:03.030 --> 05:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
who's going to take them and when you
 
05:04:05.708 --> 05:04:05.718 align:start position:0%
say local farms the State Vet calls us
 
05:04:07.548 --> 05:04:07.558 align:start position:0%
that's who they call they do call some
 
05:04:10.270 --> 05:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
local farms but they often call us they
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
call us and they call another sanctuary
 
05:04:13.590 --> 05:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
in the state of New
 
05:04:15.750 --> 05:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the police do not know about
 
05:04:18.110 --> 05:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of care fund that now exists or
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
how to apply for it our agents recently
 
05:04:23.030 --> 05:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
presented at a sheriff's meeting
 
05:04:24.590 --> 05:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
furthering our efforts to educate them
 
05:04:26.510 --> 05:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
on the process and the procedure we've
 
05:04:28.270 --> 05:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
actually put it in our empowerment
 
05:04:30.270 --> 05:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
contracts about cost of care we've put
 
05:04:31.990 --> 05:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
it in our cruelty legislation we put it
 
05:04:35.470 --> 05:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
in our M we are trying to educate police
 
05:04:37.670 --> 05:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
we are trying to educate prosecutors
 
05:04:40.110 --> 05:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
about the 14-day status hearing so that
 
05:04:41.948 --> 05:04:41.958 align:start position:0%
these cases don't go on and get
 
05:04:43.868 --> 05:04:43.878 align:start position:0%
continued and continued and
 
05:04:46.510 --> 05:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
continued to eliminate Humane agents

veterinarians and require cruelty
 
05:04:55.350 --> 05:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
charges on any case will only increase
 
05:04:57.070 --> 05:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
suffering and inflict greater pain and
 
05:04:58.788 --> 05:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
the cost to those who are at greatest
 
05:05:02.030 --> 05:05:02.040 align:start position:0%

SPCA urges you to oppose House Bill
 
05:05:14.670 --> 05:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
616 thank you for your time and I'm
 
05:05:17.230 --> 05:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions are there
 
05:05:19.788 --> 05:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
any questions representative
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:05:24.670 --> 05:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
for coming in front of us
 
05:05:27.190 --> 05:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
um I have the same almost exactly the
 
05:05:29.430 --> 05:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
same question for you as I had for M Lee
 
05:05:32.030 --> 05:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
sure would you not agree that this RS an
 
05:05:34.628 --> 05:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
RSA such as this would protect your
 
05:05:37.830 --> 05:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
organization as well as the public
 
05:05:39.910 --> 05:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
interest I don't think it would protect
 
05:05:41.310 --> 05:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
the public interest and I don't think it
 
05:05:42.910 --> 05:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
would protect animals because what
 
05:05:45.110 --> 05:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
you're doing is you're implying that
 
05:05:48.270 --> 05:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
police officers are the ones required
 
05:05:49.670 --> 05:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
first of all in order to get a search
 
05:05:51.470 --> 05:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
warrant you have to involve the police
 
05:05:52.470 --> 05:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
the police are the ones who get
 
05:05:54.030 --> 05:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
complaints who call us that happened in
 
05:05:56.150 --> 05:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
Lee you know it doesn't just happen from
 
05:05:58.070 --> 05:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
citizens it happens also from the police
 
05:06:00.708 --> 05:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
departments um they call us all the time
 
05:06:01.750 --> 05:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
that they're getting complaints and
 
05:06:02.868 --> 05:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
they're not they don't know what to do
 
05:06:04.070 --> 05:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
they want us to come out they want us to
 
05:06:07.868 --> 05:06:07.878 align:start position:0%
advise they want us to assist so in this
 
05:06:11.230 --> 05:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
case I think that there are it's not
 
05:06:13.670 --> 05:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
going to improve I think mandating that
 
05:06:15.548 --> 05:06:15.558 align:start position:0%
you have cruelty charges instead of the
 
05:06:18.548 --> 05:06:18.558 align:start position:0%
death by um unauthorized
 
05:06:22.670 --> 05:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
taking I think that there are so many
 
05:06:24.670 --> 05:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
times when there's mental illness we
 
05:06:28.830 --> 05:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
took 39 cats from a gentleman and you
 
05:06:31.310 --> 05:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
know the police knew him very well
 
05:06:33.030 --> 05:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
Social Services were working with them
 
05:06:35.190 --> 05:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
he had 39 cats in his bed including
 
05:06:37.510 --> 05:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
tapeworm and all kinds of other
 
05:06:40.548 --> 05:06:40.558 align:start position:0%
parasites our goal was not to charge him
 
05:06:42.470 --> 05:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know that's not going to be helpful
 
05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
and also people can go out and get more
 
05:06:46.750 --> 05:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
animals so our goal is to educate and to
 
05:06:49.590 --> 05:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
assist and support and provide lowcost
 
05:06:51.150 --> 05:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
spay neuters to help people with those
 
05:06:53.590 --> 05:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
overpopulation issues things like that
 
05:06:53.600 --> 05:06:55.070 align:start position:0%
overpopulation issues things like that
you're

05:06:55.070 --> 05:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:06:58.190 --> 05:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
welcome representative H Haskins thank
 
05:07:00.548 --> 05:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:07:04.470 --> 05:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
question two questions sure um do you
 
05:07:05.948 --> 05:07:05.958 align:start position:0%
believe that the
 
05:07:09.868 --> 05:07:09.878 align:start position:0%
SPCA acted honorably in the Lee case and
 
05:07:12.788 --> 05:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
if so is there anything that you would
 
05:07:15.670 --> 05:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
have done differently so first of all um
 
05:07:17.830 --> 05:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
to clarify an earlier Point as well
 
05:07:19.788 --> 05:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
there was I thought there were nine
 
05:07:21.030 --> 05:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
staff members there might have been
 
05:07:22.750 --> 05:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
seven some somewhere between seven and
 
05:07:24.628 --> 05:07:24.638 align:start position:0%
nine were on site that day in terms of
 
05:07:26.470 --> 05:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
who was there plus the two veterinarians
 
05:07:27.868 --> 05:07:27.878 align:start position:0%
that may have even included them but
 
05:07:30.750 --> 05:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'll let the the other
 
05:07:35.150 --> 05:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh individuals reference that um is
 
05:07:36.110 --> 05:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
there anything we would have done
 
05:07:38.628 --> 05:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
differently we'd gone I I believe and I
 
05:07:40.470 --> 05:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
think that if you when you hear from uh
 
05:07:41.830 --> 05:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
ton and Michelle they can speak more
 
05:07:43.110 --> 05:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
specifically because they were on site
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
in advance I was only on site for
 
05:07:47.190 --> 05:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
mediation which we're not supposed to
 
05:07:48.990 --> 05:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
talk about so I'm not going to talk
 
05:07:50.670 --> 05:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
about mediation which I didn't even know
 
05:07:54.350 --> 05:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
existed through the USDA but it was a
 
05:07:56.310 --> 05:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know it was we were there in good
 
05:08:00.270 --> 05:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
faith um and trying to come to some sort
 
05:08:02.190 --> 05:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
of agreement
 
05:08:06.910 --> 05:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:11.310 --> 05:08:11.320 align:start position:0%
differently I I can't say that I have
 
05:08:14.230 --> 05:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:16.910 --> 05:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
information to speak to that I really
 
05:08:18.910 --> 05:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
would want the others speak to it but I
 
05:08:21.830 --> 05:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
I honestly believe no I don't because I
 
05:08:23.350 --> 05:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
did see the animals I saw the animals
 
05:08:25.350 --> 05:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
when they came arrived at the
 
05:08:29.110 --> 05:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
SPCA I saw them in the coming weeks I
 
05:08:31.030 --> 05:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
know what the conditions were in there I
 
05:08:33.110 --> 05:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
saw enough of the photographs it was
 
05:08:34.628 --> 05:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
heart-wrenching to me it was really
 
05:08:39.470 --> 05:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:41.110 --> 05:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
get me wrong we don't want to take them
 
05:08:43.708 --> 05:08:43.718 align:start position:0%
in right we have to then care for them
 
05:08:45.070 --> 05:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
and when we have large numbers of
 
05:08:46.990 --> 05:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
animals we have to care for them well
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
beyond our 8 to four hours and it costs
 
05:08:51.110 --> 05:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of money and you're not going to
 
05:08:53.910 --> 05:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
get it back so no it's not you know we
 
05:08:55.868 --> 05:08:55.878 align:start position:0%
don't go out seizing animals for the fun
 
05:08:58.070 --> 05:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
of it so to speak there has to be you
 
05:09:00.390 --> 05:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
know probable cause there could have
 
05:09:02.110 --> 05:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
been charges there was a surrender in
 
05:09:05.390 --> 05:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
that case um so that those charges did
 
05:09:06.390 --> 05:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
not come
 
05:09:10.390 --> 05:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
forth thank you he representative King
 
05:09:11.910 --> 05:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
05:09:14.830 --> 05:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
testimony and taking
 
05:09:18.990 --> 05:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
questions um when a bill is drafted uh
 
05:09:21.390 --> 05:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
lots of times it hits a lot of different
 
05:09:24.510 --> 05:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
sections and subsections of rsas in the
 
05:09:27.868 --> 05:09:27.878 align:start position:0%
attempt to provide more protections
 
05:09:29.230 --> 05:09:29.240 align:start position:0%
you've clearly spoken out against the
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
bill and I think you've made some solid
 
05:09:33.670 --> 05:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
points on some certain issues but I'm
 
05:09:35.150 --> 05:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
just wondering if there's any part of
 
05:09:37.548 --> 05:09:37.558 align:start position:0%
the bill that you like one part I'm
 
05:09:38.990 --> 05:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
thinking of that I don't think you
 
05:09:41.190 --> 05:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
address maybe you did I apologize if you
 
05:09:45.670 --> 05:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
did but um on the first page subsection
 
05:09:48.868 --> 05:09:48.878 align:start position:0%
two um the person charged this would be
 
05:09:50.910 --> 05:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
added to the current language the person
 
05:09:53.708 --> 05:09:53.718 align:start position:0%
charged shall be made aware of this and
 
05:09:55.470 --> 05:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
then of course there be need to be
 
05:09:56.708 --> 05:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
another amendment to put the word
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
ability in ability to petition and
 
05:10:01.230 --> 05:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
writing the arresting officer do you do
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
you think even that is totally uncalled
 
05:10:04.470 --> 05:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
for or no I you know we would have
 
05:10:06.990 --> 05:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
welcomed a vet if if they if we had
 
05:10:08.430 --> 05:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
gotten a call saying you know we'd like
 
05:10:09.910 --> 05:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
our vet to come out and
 
05:10:12.548 --> 05:10:12.558 align:start position:0%
look at the animals so be it you know
 
05:10:14.270 --> 05:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
they're professional licensed
 
05:10:16.470 --> 05:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
individuals that we respect we hire vets
 
05:10:20.548 --> 05:10:20.558 align:start position:0%
we have vets on staff so um that's not
 
05:10:22.070 --> 05:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
an issue I think that what you have to
 
05:10:23.708 --> 05:10:23.718 align:start position:0%
do however is somehow you have to build
 
05:10:26.030 --> 05:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
it into the documentation because if you
 
05:10:28.390 --> 05:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
expect the police to give that
 
05:10:30.070 --> 05:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
documentation that's where it's going to
 
05:10:34.030 --> 05:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
fall apart um but if it's on a search
 
05:10:36.150 --> 05:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
warrant if it's on a seizure if it's on
 
05:10:38.708 --> 05:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
you know something that the individual
 
05:10:39.830 --> 05:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
has to sign
 
05:10:41.750 --> 05:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
that it clearly states that they can
 
05:10:43.030 --> 05:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
have a vet of their choosing come out
 
05:10:45.230 --> 05:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
and do an invest you know uh examine the
 
05:10:47.548 --> 05:10:47.558 align:start position:0%
animals that would that you know that's
 
05:10:49.470 --> 05:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
fine okay so it's not the whole bill
 
05:10:51.150 --> 05:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
it's just some parts of the bill you're
 
05:10:52.708 --> 05:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
totally against other parts you're okay
 
05:10:55.868 --> 05:10:55.878 align:start position:0%
with sure okay thank
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
you uh yes representative rubert uh
 
05:11:02.110 --> 05:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and thank you for taking a
 
05:11:04.990 --> 05:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
question um would you be willing to
 
05:11:07.230 --> 05:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
provide back to us in writing which
 
05:11:09.628 --> 05:11:09.638 align:start position:0%
areas the bill you think you would
 
05:11:13.270 --> 05:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
support um and areas that rather than I
 
05:11:14.590 --> 05:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
I would love to say that I could do it
 
05:11:16.510 --> 05:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
by tomorrow but I can't I think to
 
05:11:17.948 --> 05:11:17.958 align:start position:0%
tomorrow but would that be helpful
 
05:11:19.830 --> 05:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
because I I would certainly be willing
 
05:11:21.430 --> 05:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
to look at it and see if there were you
 
05:11:23.868 --> 05:11:23.878 align:start position:0%
know if there were elements that we felt
 
05:11:27.190 --> 05:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
would strengthen the law you know I it's
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:33.788 --> 05:11:33.798 align:start position:0%
ways the police don't know to call the
 
05:11:36.310 --> 05:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
Department of a for
 
05:11:38.590 --> 05:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
support I'll tell you that they they
 
05:11:40.270 --> 05:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
don't I called them I called the
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
department of a twice a couple of weeks
 
05:11:45.510 --> 05:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
ago begging them to assist us in a case
 
05:11:47.350 --> 05:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
and they said no that's law enforcement
 
05:11:48.910 --> 05:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's an animal welfare issue that's
 
05:11:48.920 --> 05:11:50.390 align:start position:0%
that's an animal welfare issue that's
law

05:11:50.390 --> 05:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:11:53.830 --> 05:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement so the law enforcement
 
05:11:56.030 --> 05:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
called but they called Public Health
 
05:11:58.030 --> 05:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
they didn't call the Department of a so
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
the department of a didn't come out so
 
05:12:02.548 --> 05:12:02.558 align:start position:0%
there's just so much misinformation out
 
05:12:04.830 --> 05:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
there it's challenging and even though
 
05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
the department of a distributes
 
05:12:10.270 --> 05:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
information you know there's Transitions
 
05:12:12.948 --> 05:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
and all kinds of things it's very hard
 
05:12:15.270 --> 05:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
so you know we sit there people know to
 
05:12:18.190 --> 05:12:18.200 align:start position:0%
call us and we work in partnership with
 
05:12:19.788 --> 05:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
with the police we call them to let them
 
05:12:21.750 --> 05:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
know we're going into that town right
 
05:12:23.350 --> 05:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
we're sending individuals by themselves
 
05:12:25.830 --> 05:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's a safety issue we want them to know
 
05:12:29.510 --> 05:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
that we're on site but yes I'd be happy
 
05:12:31.708 --> 05:12:31.718 align:start position:0%
to work with our team and and look at
 
05:12:34.190 --> 05:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
this I'm not an expert in law but I'm
 
05:12:37.788 --> 05:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
happy to do it just a quick follow as as
 
05:12:40.110 --> 05:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier here these bills they
 
05:12:42.990 --> 05:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
go through amendments modifications we
 
05:12:45.510 --> 05:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
we try to listen carefully to all the
 
05:12:47.948 --> 05:12:47.958 align:start position:0%
parties understand things and trying to
 
05:12:50.830 --> 05:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
trying to change things in a way that
 
05:12:53.868 --> 05:12:53.878 align:start position:0%
are systemic right and um and not kind
 
05:12:55.910 --> 05:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
of generic we just don't like the like
 
05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
right so that this would be helpful
 
05:12:58.788 --> 05:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and it's important I mean
 
05:13:00.868 --> 05:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
I know this is
 
05:13:03.390 --> 05:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
a I I think it's important to look at
 
05:13:05.470 --> 05:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
all the cases as I said you
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
know there's almost 600 cases a year of
 
05:13:11.470 --> 05:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
which almost 300 are large animals you
 
05:13:15.350 --> 05:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
don't want to change law based on one
 
05:13:17.948 --> 05:13:17.958 align:start position:0%
case necessarily you know if there's
 
05:13:20.708 --> 05:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
Improvement so be it but you have you
 
05:13:23.910 --> 05:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
know this generally is working repres SC
 
05:13:26.830 --> 05:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you Mr chair and
 
05:13:29.510 --> 05:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
again thank you for coming before us so
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering I mean people call
 
05:13:33.708 --> 05:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
in and I would think that'd be like
 
05:13:35.830 --> 05:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
three categories one who's somebody's
 
05:13:37.948 --> 05:13:37.958 align:start position:0%
doing something maliciously somebody
 
05:13:39.390 --> 05:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
who's doing something with good
 
05:13:40.990 --> 05:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
intentions but it's just wrong and then
 
05:13:43.510 --> 05:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's a legitimate uh situation that
 
05:13:46.548 --> 05:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
they're identifying for you sure how do
 
05:13:49.150 --> 05:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
you uh screen those things you know to
 
05:13:51.788 --> 05:13:51.798 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not sure bothering
 
05:13:53.310 --> 05:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
people that shouldn't be bothered right
 
05:13:54.868 --> 05:13:54.878 align:start position:0%
and I and I really would love to defer
 
05:13:56.230 --> 05:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
those to the two agents that we have
 
05:13:57.750 --> 05:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
here we have two I have you know both of
 
05:13:59.070 --> 05:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
our Humane agents are here today and
 
05:14:00.390 --> 05:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
they can speak specifically as they
 
05:14:02.230 --> 05:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
receive the calls every single day but I
 
05:14:04.590 --> 05:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
can tell you generically that depending
 
05:14:06.270 --> 05:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
upon where it is we get calls all over
 
05:14:09.510 --> 05:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
the state from Berlin to Keen etc etc is
 
05:14:10.990 --> 05:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
that you may be calling a local police
 
05:14:12.670 --> 05:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
and asking them to go do a check first
 
05:14:13.788 --> 05:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
because you don't want to be driving
 
05:14:15.670 --> 05:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
three and four hours to find out that it
 
05:14:17.470 --> 05:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
was a neighborly dispute because that
 
05:14:19.430 --> 05:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
happens right you get divorce cases you
 
05:14:21.628 --> 05:14:21.638 align:start position:0%
get all kinds of cases but sometimes
 
05:14:23.270 --> 05:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
animals are in imminent danger and so
 
05:14:26.070 --> 05:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
you want to know but again the police
 
05:14:28.350 --> 05:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
officers are not necessarily experts
 
05:14:30.510 --> 05:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
especially in livestock and equin you
 
05:14:33.230 --> 05:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
know many more police officers have cats
 
05:14:35.230 --> 05:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
and dogs than they do large animals but

you also May reach out to your local
 
05:14:39.150 --> 05:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
animal control officer sometimes it
 
05:14:41.310 --> 05:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
warrants a trip out there to do an
 
05:14:44.750 --> 05:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
investigation to to see what you can see
 
05:14:46.990 --> 05:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
to talk to the owner of the animals to
 
05:14:48.990 --> 05:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
find out is there any validity to the
 
05:14:53.110 --> 05:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
case to see the animals things like
 
05:14:56.708 --> 05:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
that follow up all right thank you so
 
05:15:00.470 --> 05:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
you for every call that comes in you are
 
05:15:02.310 --> 05:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
assuming on face value that it is
 
05:15:03.788 --> 05:15:03.798 align:start position:0%
legitimate and you're sending at least
 
05:15:07.390 --> 05:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
somebody out to look at the situation we
 
05:15:09.948 --> 05:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
assume that it's an individual with a
 
05:15:12.190 --> 05:15:12.200 align:start position:0%
concern whether it's legitimate or not
 
05:15:14.310 --> 05:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
is yet to be
 
05:15:16.628 --> 05:15:16.638 align:start position:0%
determined more quickly well how do you
 
05:15:18.390 --> 05:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
determine that you have you have a
 
05:15:21.030 --> 05:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
police officer go out and check you have
 
05:15:23.270 --> 05:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
you have somebody you know you call the
 
05:15:25.750 --> 05:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
individual and find out you know you you
 
05:15:28.030 --> 05:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
reach out in some capacity to learn more
 
05:15:31.230 --> 05:15:31.240 align:start position:0%
you have to start by learning more thank
 
05:15:32.830 --> 05:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome
 
05:15:36.070 --> 05:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
okay um I have um just a question in
 
05:15:40.150 --> 05:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
terms of General procedures um so uh we
 
05:15:43.788 --> 05:15:43.798 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that uh that the uh
 
05:15:46.670 --> 05:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
seizures took place on a 93 degree day
 
05:15:48.948 --> 05:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
is there do you have in your policies
 
05:15:51.390 --> 05:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
anything that takes into account the
 
05:15:53.310 --> 05:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
possible effects of weather conditions
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
on the animals that You' be dealing with
 
05:15:58.270 --> 05:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
um we certainly take certain things into
 
05:16:00.150 --> 05:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
consideration you know when is the
 
05:16:02.628 --> 05:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
search warrant executed what is the time
 
05:16:04.150 --> 05:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
frame what's the imminent D you know
 
05:16:06.270 --> 05:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
there are a number of elements we try
 
05:16:08.350 --> 05:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
and time things so that it's better than
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
worse but if you're in a heat wave your
 
05:16:13.070 --> 05:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
days to execute a search warrant may not
 
05:16:16.390 --> 05:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
change okay thank you you're welcome are
 
05:16:19.150 --> 05:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:24.628 --> 05:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:36.390 --> 05:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:39.150 --> 05:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
Bureau thank you Mr chair m the
 
05:16:40.670 --> 05:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Rob Johnson and
 
05:16:41.910 --> 05:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
The New Hampshire Farm Bureau
 
05:16:47.830 --> 05:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
representing our uh nearly 2500 members
 
05:16:49.708 --> 05:16:49.718 align:start position:0%
and we are in support of the bill I've
 
05:16:51.628 --> 05:16:51.638 align:start position:0%
been before you before mentioned we had
 
05:16:53.708 --> 05:16:53.718 align:start position:0%
kind of three bills in this area coming
 
05:16:55.510 --> 05:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
and this is the the third of those three
 
05:16:57.270 --> 05:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
and it's been stated previously we've
 
05:16:59.190 --> 05:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
been working with the sponsors of the
 
05:17:02.270 --> 05:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
bill and and the department uh on it and
 
05:17:05.270 --> 05:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
we believe that it it uh provides some
 
05:17:08.150 --> 05:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
due process for animal owners in the law
 
05:17:11.070 --> 05:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
some clarity some consistency and also
 
05:17:14.390 --> 05:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
some flexibility uh for the the
 
05:17:16.350 --> 05:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
particularly for the uh State Vet and
 
05:17:19.190 --> 05:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture there
 
05:17:23.110 --> 05:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
are 10 or so areas uh where substantive
 
05:17:25.430 --> 05:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
changes are made in the animal cruelty
 
05:17:28.548 --> 05:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
statutes and then I'd like to speak to
 
05:17:32.990 --> 05:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:35.670 --> 05:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
highlight I'll St I'll start with on
 
05:17:40.510 --> 05:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
page page one uh where the the language
 
05:17:45.390 --> 05:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
is struck in line 19 and 20 uh officer
 
05:17:47.750 --> 05:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
of a duly licensed Humane
 
05:17:54.150 --> 05:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
Society um we strongly believe that uh
 
05:17:56.948 --> 05:17:56.958 align:start position:0%
any such action should be taken by a
 
05:17:56.958 --> 05:17:57.990 align:start position:0%
any such action should be taken by a
public

05:17:57.990 --> 05:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:18:00.868 --> 05:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
official uh whether it be as is already
 
05:18:04.590 --> 05:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
in the statute a law enforcement officer
 
05:18:07.270 --> 05:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
or an animal control officer and we
 
05:18:09.230 --> 05:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
would ask that the the bill be amended
 
05:18:10.990 --> 05:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
to clarify that further by saying
 
05:18:14.390 --> 05:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
Municipal Animal control
 
05:18:17.390 --> 05:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
officer um it's a police action that's
 
05:18:20.510 --> 05:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
taking place this is the criminal
 
05:18:23.190 --> 05:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
code there's just no
 
05:18:25.830 --> 05:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
oversight when we're talking an officer
 
05:18:27.868 --> 05:18:27.878 align:start position:0%
of a duly licensed Humane Society what
 
05:18:29.670 --> 05:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
what exactly does that mean I know it
 
05:18:31.830 --> 05:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
was testified previously that they it's
 
05:18:34.990 --> 05:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
a a former retired police officer the
 
05:18:36.868 --> 05:18:36.878 align:start position:0%
way it's worded it could be the
 
05:18:38.788 --> 05:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
president vice president treasur
 
05:18:42.390 --> 05:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of a of a licensed uh uh
 
05:18:47.430 --> 05:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
Humane Society it it's uh it's
 
05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
confusing to to animal owners when when
 
05:18:52.670 --> 05:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know there somebody in this
 
05:18:55.190 --> 05:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
capacity shows up an officer of a
 
05:18:57.310 --> 05:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
licensed Humane Society is they I've
 
05:18:59.230 --> 05:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
I've gotten on I've been with F beer now
 
05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
for nearly 25 years and there's been a
 
05:19:02.510 --> 05:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
couple occasions where I've got phone
 
05:19:05.190 --> 05:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
calls from Members asking what what's
 
05:19:07.350 --> 05:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
this all who are these people and and
 
05:19:11.070 --> 05:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
you know again it's it's confusing so
 
05:19:16.548 --> 05:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to just um the the
 
05:19:20.510 --> 05:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh second area I'd like to to highlight
 
05:19:22.868 --> 05:19:22.878 align:start position:0%
is where you see and I'll it's in a few
 
05:19:25.230 --> 05:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
places but line five where lines four
 
05:19:27.110 --> 05:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
and five where it says a state
 
05:19:29.350 --> 05:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
veterinarian or their design and it's
 
05:19:31.350 --> 05:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
their design I want to highlight and
 
05:19:34.270 --> 05:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
then you look on page two line 10
 
05:19:37.310 --> 05:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
veterinarian or their
 
05:19:39.310 --> 05:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
design page
 
05:19:44.830 --> 05:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh three line 22 20 21 21 and 22 State
 
05:19:48.110 --> 05:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
veteran or their design and what what
 
05:19:49.948 --> 05:19:49.958 align:start position:0%
that does is again we believe this
 
05:19:51.030 --> 05:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
provides some
 
05:19:53.750 --> 05:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility uh for the State Vet where
 
05:19:56.708 --> 05:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
that design again it could be a a
 
05:19:59.948 --> 05:19:59.958 align:start position:0%
licensed veterinarian it could be one of
 
05:20:03.310 --> 05:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
the uh technicians in the the Office of
 
05:20:04.310 --> 05:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
the State
 
05:20:06.590 --> 05:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
veterinarian or it could be another
 
05:20:08.750 --> 05:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
individual that the state veterinarian
 
05:20:10.948 --> 05:20:10.958 align:start position:0%
believes has the capacity and and
 
05:20:12.830 --> 05:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
understanding and knowledge to to you
 
05:20:15.310 --> 05:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
know go out and take a look uh for them
 
05:20:17.470 --> 05:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
to see if it is a a situation that
 
05:20:19.628 --> 05:20:19.638 align:start position:0%
justifies the expertise of a vet going
 
05:20:23.110 --> 05:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
out uh already happens now that on
 
05:20:25.470 --> 05:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
occasion uh we have members where their
 
05:20:27.350 --> 05:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement agency will call
 
05:20:28.830 --> 05:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
them and say we they've got a complaint
 
05:20:30.230 --> 05:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
and ask the farmer to go out and take a
 
05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
look just again all of these situations
 
05:20:38.150 --> 05:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
are pro where the design is not is
 
05:20:38.160 --> 05:20:39.430 align:start position:0%
are pro where the design is not is
providing

05:20:39.430 --> 05:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
providing
 
05:20:42.990 --> 05:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh advice to law enforcement or the
 
05:20:44.830 --> 05:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
state vet to experts they're not they're
 
05:20:46.868 --> 05:20:46.878 align:start position:0%
not dealing with the the owner it's
 
05:20:49.070 --> 05:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
again that's that it's it's where the
 
05:20:52.230 --> 05:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
the uh individual is again uh providing
 
05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
advice to to uh officials and then to to
 
05:20:58.510 --> 05:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
what goes along with that is you'll see
 
05:21:01.910 --> 05:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to point out uh in
 
05:21:06.590 --> 05:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
line uh page three line six where where
 
05:21:10.470 --> 05:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
it it uh provides uh um liability
 
05:21:12.430 --> 05:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
protection not just to a veterinarian
 
05:21:15.868 --> 05:21:15.878 align:start position:0%
but also to an individual who who who is
 
05:21:18.150 --> 05:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh assisting you know officials in an
 
05:21:20.628 --> 05:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
investigation so that way the again the
 
05:21:22.470 --> 05:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
that was one issue when we we talked
 
05:21:23.830 --> 05:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
about this with our members they were
 
05:21:26.948 --> 05:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
concerned about you know liability um uh
 
05:21:28.590 --> 05:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
and this this would again like like we
 
05:21:30.628 --> 05:21:30.638 align:start position:0%
currently have for a veterinarian uh
 
05:21:33.430 --> 05:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
provide some liability protection and
 
05:21:36.350 --> 05:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
then the third area I wanted to touch on
 
05:21:38.708 --> 05:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
uh in the law is just I mentioned it it
 
05:21:42.510 --> 05:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
it brings some uh Clarity consistency
 
05:21:44.350 --> 05:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
and if you again this has been touched
 
05:21:47.830 --> 05:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
on before but you on page one uh lines
 
05:21:52.350 --> 05:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh 9 and 10 under uh confiscation it
 
05:21:55.708 --> 05:21:55.718 align:start position:0%
provides for that the for a a uh
 
05:21:57.868 --> 05:21:57.878 align:start position:0%
examination by a vet at the animal
 
05:21:59.788 --> 05:21:59.798 align:start position:0%
owner's expense and that they need to be
 
05:22:01.230 --> 05:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
made aware of this that's in the case of
 
05:22:04.390 --> 05:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
a confiscation and then you look on uh
 
05:22:06.310 --> 05:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
page two
 
05:22:09.270 --> 05:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
lines uh 678
 
05:22:11.270 --> 05:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh where again it now provides the same
 
05:22:13.230 --> 05:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
thing for where an animal is taken in
 
05:22:14.910 --> 05:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
protective custody and that's not
 
05:22:16.510 --> 05:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
currently the case in both situations
 
05:22:18.310 --> 05:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
where those are provided so it is in
 
05:22:21.948 --> 05:22:21.958 align:start position:0%
consistent um I will I will close at
 
05:22:23.788 --> 05:22:23.798 align:start position:0%
that I'll be I'll be part of the the
 
05:22:25.150 --> 05:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
work session tomorrow but other than
 
05:22:27.070 --> 05:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
that I couple other things I wanted to
 
05:22:29.310 --> 05:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
highlight is one don't forget the the
 
05:22:31.510 --> 05:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
cost of care language that we had HED to
 
05:22:33.110 --> 05:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
incorporate into this when we get into
 
05:22:36.708 --> 05:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
the work session and and just in in some
 
05:22:39.230 --> 05:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
of the some of the specific of the
 
05:22:42.750 --> 05:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
situation in Lee um I wanted to point
 
05:22:42.760 --> 05:22:44.150 align:start position:0%
situation in Lee um I wanted to point
out

05:22:44.150 --> 05:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:22:46.788 --> 05:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
that the comments been made that you
 
05:22:49.310 --> 05:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
know you shouldn't make law based on one
 
05:22:53.470 --> 05:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
case this is not one case not at all
 
05:22:56.030 --> 05:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
over time there have been others there
 
05:22:59.628 --> 05:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
is a uh a similar situation at the same
 
05:23:03.990 --> 05:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
time that uh I received a phone call on
 
05:23:07.670 --> 05:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh from a uh somebody with horses uh
 
05:23:09.788 --> 05:23:09.798 align:start position:0%
based on the record recation of that
 
05:23:13.110 --> 05:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and this incident happened
 
05:23:18.270 --> 05:23:18.280 align:start position:0%
um this past spring it was in May and I
 
05:23:20.868 --> 05:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
received the phone call in October this
 
05:23:23.670 --> 05:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
person had not talked to anybody about
 
05:23:26.430 --> 05:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
this in similar to what what what Donna
 
05:23:28.910 --> 05:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
Lee I believe had mentioned to you this
 
05:23:32.708 --> 05:23:32.718 align:start position:0%
person said the way she was treated it
 
05:23:36.150 --> 05:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
was I felt post-traumatic stress she was
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
embarrassed she was
 
05:23:39.120 --> 05:23:40.910 align:start position:0%
embarrassed she was
horrified

05:23:40.910 --> 05:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
horrified
 
05:23:43.628 --> 05:23:43.638 align:start position:0%
um you know as as my wife works in the
 
05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
healthcare field and and uh she's
 
05:23:48.150 --> 05:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
probably visiting nurses and goes into
 
05:23:50.990 --> 05:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
homes and she'll tell you it's not
 
05:23:55.590 --> 05:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
uncommon to find people who have uh
 
05:23:58.070 --> 05:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
animals from dogs and cats to chickens
 
05:24:01.670 --> 05:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
in their home and those people probably
 
05:24:03.750 --> 05:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
can't rub to Nickel together but by
 
05:24:04.990 --> 05:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
goodness they're going to make sure that
 
05:24:07.070 --> 05:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
those animals eat and are comfortable
 
05:24:08.670 --> 05:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
beyond anything else and that includes
 
05:24:11.230 --> 05:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
their own care and sometimes her job is
 
05:24:12.788 --> 05:24:12.798 align:start position:0%
to tr against them that you've got to
 
05:24:17.910 --> 05:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
take care of yourself first so
 
05:24:22.190 --> 05:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
um it's it's it's
 
05:24:24.948 --> 05:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh this this individual was in that type
 
05:24:27.030 --> 05:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
of situation where I think in some of
 
05:24:29.270 --> 05:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
these cases somebody's uh you might look
 
05:24:31.910 --> 05:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
at that property from the outside and it
 
05:24:34.868 --> 05:24:34.878 align:start position:0%
may not be what we all think a home
 
05:24:37.430 --> 05:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
should look like that does not mean that
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
the animals and being well cared for and
 
05:24:42.190 --> 05:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
I I I guess just again based on the the
 
05:24:43.868 --> 05:24:43.878 align:start position:0%
years I've been doing this J that seems
 
05:24:47.470 --> 05:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
to be the case sometimes where uh some
 
05:24:49.628 --> 05:24:49.638 align:start position:0%
people are jumping to conclusions a
 
05:24:52.708 --> 05:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
little early on on some things uh in in
 
05:24:54.868 --> 05:24:54.878 align:start position:0%
regard to again to to darn Lee I just
 
05:24:57.030 --> 05:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
want to point out but she didn't say it
 
05:25:00.030 --> 05:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
that uh she was has been and has
 
05:25:02.868 --> 05:25:02.878 align:start position:0%
currently been work working with uh
 
05:25:05.670 --> 05:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
Dairy specialist from the University and
 
05:25:08.350 --> 05:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
I know that because shortly after this
 
05:25:10.628 --> 05:25:10.638 align:start position:0%
the incident happened with her I was
 
05:25:13.310 --> 05:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
called by one of them just absolutely
 
05:25:16.270 --> 05:25:16.280 align:start position:0%
disgusted to think that they knew her
 
05:25:19.390 --> 05:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
operation they knew her animals and they
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
never received a phone call or anything
 
05:25:23.470 --> 05:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
and that this was happening to her they
 
05:25:27.830 --> 05:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
were quite upset
 
05:25:30.628 --> 05:25:30.638 align:start position:0%
um and as you can all imagine it's her
 
05:25:33.190 --> 05:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
name too I I mean she participated in a
 
05:25:34.868 --> 05:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
couple farmers markets in the state and
 
05:25:37.350 --> 05:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
one of them gave her the boot with with
 
05:25:39.590 --> 05:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
with just just on the the you know the
 
05:25:44.510 --> 05:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:47.070 --> 05:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
um and I'll close with just saying that
 
05:25:49.750 --> 05:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
it was it was mentioned that that uh
 
05:25:51.270 --> 05:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
there were officials from the State
 
05:25:52.910 --> 05:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture from the state
 
05:25:55.310 --> 05:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
vet staff on site and in in in Donal
 
05:25:57.948 --> 05:25:57.958 align:start position:0%
Le's instance and um I would just ask
 
05:25:59.948 --> 05:25:59.958 align:start position:0%
you to SP uh speak with the Department
 
05:26:03.270 --> 05:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture as to why they did what
 
05:26:06.548 --> 05:26:06.558 align:start position:0%
they did before before uh just jump to
 
05:26:08.590 --> 05:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
any conclusions and like again I thank
 
05:26:11.310 --> 05:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
you for your time and uh I'll leave it
 
05:26:12.390 --> 05:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
at that would you be willing to take
 
05:26:15.708 --> 05:26:15.718 align:start position:0%
questions certainly representative King
 
05:26:17.390 --> 05:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for your
 
05:26:19.390 --> 05:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
testimony and taking questions I'm
 
05:26:20.628 --> 05:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
curious if there are any parts of the
 
05:26:22.350 --> 05:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
bill that you don't like I'm
 
05:26:25.548 --> 05:26:25.558 align:start position:0%
specifically thinking of uh page one
 
05:26:27.230 --> 05:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
lines 15 and
 
05:26:32.910 --> 05:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
16 um about the idea that um you know
 
05:26:34.990 --> 05:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
you can't individuals or organizations
 
05:26:37.110 --> 05:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to solicit donations I
 
05:26:38.590 --> 05:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
can understand that under the current
 
05:26:40.430 --> 05:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
statute there's a perverse incentive
 
05:26:44.548 --> 05:26:44.558 align:start position:0%
where an a nonprofit might that's also
 
05:26:46.628 --> 05:26:46.638 align:start position:0%
in the in the uh business of
 
05:26:48.868 --> 05:26:48.878 align:start position:0%
confiscation might therefore be you know
 
05:26:50.750 --> 05:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
making money off of that but if you get
 
05:26:54.190 --> 05:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
rid of that um like in the next
 
05:26:57.670 --> 05:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
subsection you get rid of let's say a a
 
05:26:59.470 --> 05:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
nonprofit having anything to do with it
 
05:27:01.190 --> 05:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
now it really is fully in control of the
 
05:27:03.030 --> 05:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
state then there isn't that perverse
 
05:27:05.830 --> 05:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
incentive anymore how would you feel
 
05:27:08.430 --> 05:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
about getting rid of lines 15 and 16
 
05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
what I think we would certainly be open
 
05:27:13.910 --> 05:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
to to amendment I I know you I heard
 
05:27:16.310 --> 05:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
what you mentioned earlier and and yeah
 
05:27:18.110 --> 05:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
that that wasn't thought of when we put
 
05:27:20.230 --> 05:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
it together I mean obviously we worked
 
05:27:21.670 --> 05:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
on this with the sponsors and the
 
05:27:24.430 --> 05:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
department so we're we you know we're we
 
05:27:26.190 --> 05:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
were very comfortable with it but we
 
05:27:28.030 --> 05:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
realize it's not perfect I know the
 
05:27:29.868 --> 05:27:29.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner also had some suggestions
 
05:27:32.830 --> 05:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
that that obviously deserve a close look
 
05:27:36.310 --> 05:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative Freeman
 
05:27:37.670 --> 05:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:27:39.750 --> 05:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
coming in front of us this afternoon I
 
05:27:42.070 --> 05:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
just something that came up with a bill
 
05:27:44.670 --> 05:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
that's similar to this about having two
 
05:27:47.948 --> 05:27:47.958 align:start position:0%
law enforcement offices trained um one
 
05:27:49.990 --> 05:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
of the things that was pointed out and
 
05:27:51.788 --> 05:27:51.798 align:start position:0%
actually in testimony was pointed out
 
05:27:53.830 --> 05:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
that we have an RSA on the book and
 
05:27:55.230 --> 05:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
books and I don't know if you know this
 
05:27:56.910 --> 05:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
but we have an RSA on the books that
 
05:27:59.670 --> 05:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
states when an Leo responds to a
 
05:28:02.350 --> 05:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
complaint of animal cruelty a vet is
 
05:28:06.110 --> 05:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to be called so I I'm not sure
 
05:28:09.548 --> 05:28:09.558 align:start position:0%
anybody has full knowledge of that RSA
 
05:28:11.270 --> 05:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering if you know about that
 
05:28:14.310 --> 05:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
R we certainly do for for livestock a a
 
05:28:16.110 --> 05:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
a a veterinarian needs to make the
 
05:28:17.868 --> 05:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
probable cause of termination yes that's
 
05:28:19.510 --> 05:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
something that we're very aware of and
 
05:28:21.830 --> 05:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
and you're you're correct yes at the
 
05:28:24.110 --> 05:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
hearing one I guess one of a lot
 
05:28:25.470 --> 05:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials asked and said
 
05:28:27.390 --> 05:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
that they did not know and I think that
 
05:28:31.190 --> 05:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
is the case yeah follow up yes thank you
 
05:28:34.868 --> 05:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
so so really the Leo is not responsible
 
05:28:37.030 --> 05:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
for determining if there is a case of
 
05:28:39.548 --> 05:28:39.558 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty or or neglect with
 
05:28:42.150 --> 05:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
livestock correct and that's part of
 
05:28:43.628 --> 05:28:43.638 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to accomplish in the
 
05:28:45.110 --> 05:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
bill to make clear it is not law
 
05:28:46.788 --> 05:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement we do not want them making
 
05:28:49.150 --> 05:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
those decisions and in most cases they
 
05:28:50.430 --> 05:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
understand they don't have the expertise
 
05:28:52.628 --> 05:28:52.638 align:start position:0%
and the knowledge but they need to know
 
05:28:55.070 --> 05:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
where to get that okay and one more
 
05:28:56.910 --> 05:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
followup thank you so much that's part
 
05:28:58.590 --> 05:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
of that bill if you're not not going to
 
05:29:00.830 --> 05:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
study thank you so much for indulging Me
 
05:29:03.548 --> 05:29:03.558 align:start position:0%
So based on what the vet will tell the
 
05:29:06.830 --> 05:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
Leo the Leo will proceed with whatever
 
05:29:08.670 --> 05:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
criminal charges
 
05:29:11.350 --> 05:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
would be put on that particular owner is
 
05:29:12.430 --> 05:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
that correct yeah they'll make the

Lee um I am currently a the ecoin and

Hampshire SPCA as well as a cruelty
 
05:30:23.830 --> 05:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
investigator I am a retired law
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer from um the cities
 
05:30:30.788 --> 05:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
of do and Durham after 24 years um I am
 
05:30:33.708 --> 05:30:33.718 align:start position:0%
writing to oppose House Bill 616 for
 
05:30:35.628 --> 05:30:35.638 align:start position:0%
several significant concerns about its
 
05:30:38.190 --> 05:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
impact on the effective effectiveness of
 
05:30:40.390 --> 05:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty investigations and the
 
05:30:41.830 --> 05:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
welfare of animals in the state of New
 
05:30:43.910 --> 05:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a former law enforcement
 
05:30:45.830 --> 05:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
officer ecoin and farm program manager
 
05:30:47.510 --> 05:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
and Humane agent I believe I bring
 
05:30:49.310 --> 05:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
valuable insight into the Practical
 
05:30:50.910 --> 05:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
realities of investigating animal
 
05:30:53.150 --> 05:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
cruelty and the essential role that
 
05:30:55.150 --> 05:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
Humane agents play in safeguarding the
 
05:30:56.510 --> 05:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
animals of our
 
05:30:59.590 --> 05:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
state house bill 616 proposes that the
 
05:31:01.708 --> 05:31:01.718 align:start position:0%
state veterinarian or their design be
 
05:31:02.948 --> 05:31:02.958 align:start position:0%
the vet of record on cruelty
 
05:31:04.670 --> 05:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
investigations while I respect the
 
05:31:06.628 --> 05:31:06.638 align:start position:0%
expertise of our state veterinarians the
 
05:31:08.270 --> 05:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
volume of Cruelty cases that are occur
 
05:31:10.830 --> 05:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis far exceeds the
 
05:31:12.190 --> 05:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
capacity for their small team of
 
05:31:14.430 --> 05:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
veterinarians to effectively manage
 
05:31:16.190 --> 05:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
cruelty investigations often require
 
05:31:18.510 --> 05:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
timely timely on-site assessments and
 
05:31:21.708 --> 05:31:21.718 align:start position:0%
Swift swift interventions particularly
 
05:31:24.070 --> 05:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
when animals are in immediate danger the
 
05:31:26.030 --> 05:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
state veterinarian with all due respect
 
05:31:27.670 --> 05:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
would be overwhelmed by the sheer number
 
05:31:29.868 --> 05:31:29.878 align:start position:0%
of cases potentially leading to delays
 
05:31:31.788 --> 05:31:31.798 align:start position:0%
in intervention and compromising the
 
05:31:34.190 --> 05:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
welfare of animals involved according to
 
05:31:36.868 --> 05:31:36.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law currently livestock
 
05:31:39.590 --> 05:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
cannot be seized without the direction
 
05:31:41.510 --> 05:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
of a licensed
 
05:31:43.350 --> 05:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
veterinarian this law ensures that
 
05:31:45.310 --> 05:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
seizures are done responsibly and with
 
05:31:47.270 --> 05:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
proper expertise large animal
 
05:31:49.110 --> 05:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
veterinarians or veterinarians with
 
05:31:51.190 --> 05:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
expertise in livestock are the only
 
05:31:53.150 --> 05:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
veterinarians used during large animal
 
05:31:56.628 --> 05:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
cruelty investigations I have spoken to
 
05:31:59.430 --> 05:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
veterinarians on site at
 
05:32:02.310 --> 05:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
investigations when I don't have a vet
 
05:32:03.830 --> 05:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm local to I call a
 
05:32:05.510 --> 05:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarian's office and if they are
 
05:32:07.590 --> 05:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
not familiar with livestock they will
 
05:32:09.910 --> 05:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
not assist me they absolutely will not
 
05:32:12.548 --> 05:32:12.558 align:start position:0%
so I cannot get a cat doctor to come out
 
05:32:14.788 --> 05:32:14.798 align:start position:0%
and seize a horse just to be
 
05:32:17.470 --> 05:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
clear Humane agents are special are
 
05:32:19.190 --> 05:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
specialists in animal welfare and have
 
05:32:20.948 --> 05:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
the necessary experience to handle the
 
05:32:22.750 --> 05:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
intricacies of animal cruelty
 
05:32:24.708 --> 05:32:24.718 align:start position:0%
investigations they are trained not only
 
05:32:26.548 --> 05:32:26.558 align:start position:0%
in the laws that protect animals but
 
05:32:28.868 --> 05:32:28.878 align:start position:0%
also the best practices for ensuring the
 
05:32:31.548 --> 05:32:31.558 align:start position:0%
well-being of animals in distress By REM
 
05:32:33.350 --> 05:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
removing Humane Agents from the
 
05:32:36.190 --> 05:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
investigative process House Bill 616
 
05:32:38.230 --> 05:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
would leave animals at a much greater
 
05:32:41.190 --> 05:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
risk of harm many police officers while
 
05:32:43.430 --> 05:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
well-meaning do not possess the same
 
05:32:44.948 --> 05:32:44.958 align:start position:0%
level of expertise when it comes to
 
05:32:47.270 --> 05:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
handling animal cruelty cases Humane
 
05:32:49.230 --> 05:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
agents play a crucial role working with
 
05:32:51.310 --> 05:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and veterinarians
 
05:32:55.230 --> 05:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:57.548 --> 05:32:57.558 align:start position:0%
protected but also the investigations
 
05:32:59.030 --> 05:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
are carried out in accordance with the
 
05:33:01.190 --> 05:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
law and compassion for the animals
 
05:33:03.868 --> 05:33:03.878 align:start position:0%
involved law law enforcement looks to
 
05:33:05.670 --> 05:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
Humane agents for support in conducting
 
05:33:07.190 --> 05:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
investigations and sharing their
 
05:33:07.200 --> 05:33:08.270 align:start position:0%
investigations and sharing their
expertise

05:33:08.270 --> 05:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
05:33:09.948 --> 05:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
police officers are simply not equipped
 
05:33:11.990 --> 05:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
to handle the complexities of animal
 
05:33:13.868 --> 05:33:13.878 align:start position:0%
cruelty cases in the same way Humane
 
05:33:16.670 --> 05:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
agents are without proper training and
 
05:33:19.750 --> 05:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
expertise officers may fail to
 
05:33:21.510 --> 05:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
understand the nuances of Animal Welfare
 
05:33:23.590 --> 05:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
laws leading to potential mishandling of
 
05:33:25.868 --> 05:33:25.878 align:start position:0%
cases or missed opportunities to protect
 
05:33:28.190 --> 05:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
animals as a former law enforcement
 
05:33:31.470 --> 05:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
officer I spent 24 years on the job I
 
05:33:35.110 --> 05:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
was um on the mounted Patrol so I cared
 
05:33:37.110 --> 05:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
for Animals whenever cruelty
 
05:33:40.590 --> 05:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
investigations came up it was shocking
 
05:33:42.590 --> 05:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
to all of us we didn't handle enough of
 
05:33:44.788 --> 05:33:44.798 align:start position:0%
them we had to look for animal control
 
05:33:46.590 --> 05:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
officer if she was not available we
 
05:33:48.350 --> 05:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
would look to Humane agents because we
 
05:33:50.230 --> 05:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
would have to go back to the law and try
 
05:33:52.070 --> 05:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
to figure out the Dynamics of it because
 
05:33:54.708 --> 05:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
we handled one every sever every several
 
05:33:56.110 --> 05:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
years it wasn't something we did on a
 
05:33:59.190 --> 05:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
regular basis so you need someone that
 
05:34:01.390 --> 05:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
has some expertise and veterinarians are
 
05:34:03.590 --> 05:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
not always available either you know so
 
05:34:05.030 --> 05:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
you have to have other people in the
 
05:34:06.948 --> 05:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
field besides just police officers
 
05:34:06.958 --> 05:34:08.390 align:start position:0%
field besides just police officers
they're

05:34:08.390 --> 05:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:34:10.750 --> 05:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
very very busy doing a lot of other
 
05:34:13.628 --> 05:34:13.638 align:start position:0%
things Humane agents focus on animals
 
05:34:16.110 --> 05:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
it's just you know what we do so that's
 
05:34:17.788 --> 05:34:17.798 align:start position:0%
where our expertise
 
05:34:20.590 --> 05:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
lies um challenges in requiring officers
 
05:34:22.030 --> 05:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
to inform defendants of animal
 
05:34:23.830 --> 05:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
examinations the bill also requires the
 
05:34:26.110 --> 05:34:26.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers to inform those
 
05:34:28.548 --> 05:34:28.558 align:start position:0%
charged with animal cruelty that they
 
05:34:29.788 --> 05:34:29.798 align:start position:0%
can petition the court to have a
 
05:34:31.510 --> 05:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarian of their choosing exam
 
05:34:33.670 --> 05:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
examine the animals in writing this
 
05:34:35.910 --> 05:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
provision is highly unrealistic as Law
 
05:34:37.948 --> 05:34:37.958 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers receive very little
 
05:34:39.590 --> 05:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
specialized training in animal cruelty
 
05:34:42.990 --> 05:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
Beyond a minimum of 2-hour block at the
 
05:34:45.670 --> 05:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
police academy the current law includes
 
05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
this information without requiring
 
05:34:50.030 --> 05:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
officers to ensure defendants are aware
 
05:34:53.390 --> 05:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
in writing animals are evidence in
 
05:34:55.190 --> 05:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
cruelty investigations in many cruelty
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
investigations the animals are the
 
05:34:59.110 --> 05:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
evidence of the case and are seized or
 
05:35:01.510 --> 05:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
taken into protective custody during the
 
05:35:03.708 --> 05:35:03.718 align:start position:0%
investigation as with any criminal
 
05:35:05.788 --> 05:35:05.798 align:start position:0%
investigation charg charges are not
 
05:35:07.910 --> 05:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
immediately filed unless they are Fel
 
05:35:09.708 --> 05:35:09.718 align:start position:0%
level charges there are exent
 
05:35:11.590 --> 05:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances or the crime was committed
 
05:35:14.708 --> 05:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
in an officer's presence and not all
 
05:35:17.310 --> 05:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
crimes involving animals are intentional
 
05:35:19.750 --> 05:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's important to recognize that not all
 
05:35:21.788 --> 05:35:21.798 align:start position:0%
crimes involving animals are intentional
 
05:35:24.230 --> 05:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
acts of Cruelty we frequently frequently
 
05:35:26.230 --> 05:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
deal with elderly individuals people
 
05:35:28.868 --> 05:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
with mental illness or others who may
 
05:35:30.750 --> 05:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
unintentionally neglect or harm their
 
05:35:32.910 --> 05:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
animals due to lack of understanding
 
05:35:34.990 --> 05:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
cognitive decline or other
 
05:35:37.030 --> 05:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances in these cases law
 
05:35:39.070 --> 05:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Humane agents must have
 
05:35:40.430 --> 05:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
the discretion to determine the
 
05:35:42.390 --> 05:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate course of action whether it
 
05:35:44.830 --> 05:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
involves education intervention or
 
05:35:47.030 --> 05:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
assistance removing discretion would
 
05:35:49.350 --> 05:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
lead to unjust consequences particularly
 
05:35:51.270 --> 05:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
for vulnerable individuals who may need
 
05:35:54.070 --> 05:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
support rather than punitive action in
 
05:35:56.350 --> 05:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
conclusion I urge you to reconsider the
 
05:35:58.670 --> 05:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
provisions of House Bill 616 they would
 
05:36:00.788 --> 05:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
undermine the effec effectiveness of

in protecting the welfare of animals and
 
05:36:10.430 --> 05:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
removing them from the process would be
 
05:36:12.350 --> 05:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
detrimental to our ability to respond to
 
05:36:15.390 --> 05:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
cruelty in a timely and effective manner
 
05:36:16.990 --> 05:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
additionally removing discretion from
 
05:36:18.190 --> 05:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
law enforcement would lead to
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and harmful consequences for
 
05:36:22.190 --> 05:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
those who unintentionally harm their
 
05:36:25.750 --> 05:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
animals I ask to vote against 616 and
 
05:36:27.270 --> 05:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
maintain the important role of Humane
 
05:36:29.708 --> 05:36:29.718 align:start position:0%
agents in investigative investigation

my question Miss merch um my question
 
05:36:47.830 --> 05:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
given the fact that uh there are not
 
05:36:49.350 --> 05:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
officers who know how to handle these
 
05:36:52.270 --> 05:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty situations according to
 
05:36:54.470 --> 05:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
your testimony can you tell us why you
 
05:36:57.150 --> 05:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
went from being an officer to the
 
05:37:00.390 --> 05:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
SPCA I retired from law enforcement so I
 
05:37:02.830 --> 05:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
was finished being a police officer I
 
05:37:06.230 --> 05:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
had enough after 24 years um and I am
 
05:37:08.350 --> 05:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
very passionate about animals and animal
 
05:37:13.030 --> 05:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
welfare and I started um initially I
 
05:37:14.430 --> 05:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to be a cruelty investigator to
 
05:37:17.990 --> 05:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
help protect the animals um I started to
 
05:37:22.190 --> 05:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
look into the laws the you know lack of
 
05:37:24.030 --> 05:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
consistency in laws I was interested in
 
05:37:27.788 --> 05:37:27.798 align:start position:0%
it um I became the equinum farm program
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
manager which means I am in charge of
 
05:37:31.670 --> 05:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
taking care of all the large animals
 
05:37:34.030 --> 05:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
outside that is my job to rehab
 
05:37:36.070 --> 05:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate and rehome that is my
 
05:37:38.030 --> 05:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
primary responsibility the shelter and
 
05:37:39.910 --> 05:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
the more that I became involved in
 
05:37:42.070 --> 05:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
rehabbing and re in rehoming those
 
05:37:44.628 --> 05:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
animals and rescuing them the more
 
05:37:46.708 --> 05:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
passionate I came became about making
 
05:37:49.350 --> 05:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
sure they were protected um we see some
 
05:37:52.030 --> 05:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
awful things I was in law enforcement
 
05:37:54.190 --> 05:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
for 24 years I saw some awful things
 
05:37:59.670 --> 05:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
there animal cruelty is far worse um the
 
05:38:02.670 --> 05:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
things that we see at people's homes are
 
05:38:05.830 --> 05:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
is devastating um some of the hardest
 
05:38:07.548 --> 05:38:07.558 align:start position:0%
things I've ever seen in my life have
 
05:38:09.270 --> 05:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
been in the F past four years involving
 
05:38:11.750 --> 05:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
animals and many many times it's not
 
05:38:14.548 --> 05:38:14.558 align:start position:0%
intentional people become overwhelmed
 
05:38:16.430 --> 05:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
they're embarrassed they don't know
 
05:38:18.590 --> 05:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
where to ask for help even though we're
 
05:38:21.948 --> 05:38:21.958 align:start position:0%
here and we do not judge they don't
 
05:38:24.230 --> 05:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily always come to us family and
 
05:38:27.190 --> 05:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
friends don't always step up until after
 
05:38:30.150 --> 05:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
the police or Humane agents or whoever
 
05:38:35.110 --> 05:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
steps in um so it it's it's something
 
05:38:38.708 --> 05:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
I'm very passionate about and um um
 
05:38:40.350 --> 05:38:40.360 align:start position:0%
that's why I got
 
05:38:42.708 --> 05:38:42.718 align:start position:0%
involved thank you for taking that
 
05:38:45.070 --> 05:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
question and I having been on the
 
05:38:47.310 --> 05:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee remember the
 
05:38:49.150 --> 05:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty cases that we would hear
 
05:38:51.468 --> 05:38:51.478 align:start position:0%
about and it is something it's some of
 
05:38:52.750 --> 05:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
the worst things that happen in the
 
05:38:56.510 --> 05:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
state it really is now my second
 
05:38:59.230 --> 05:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
question to do with what you just said
 
05:39:02.430 --> 05:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
equin and this is kind of a maybe a
 
05:39:04.190 --> 05:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
silly question but I want to get an
 
05:39:07.110 --> 05:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
answer to it anyway equin I was under
 
05:39:10.230 --> 05:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
the impression that it meant horse it
 
05:39:12.830 --> 05:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
does okay you said it handles all large
 
05:39:14.910 --> 05:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
animals so I so I'm the equin and farm
 
05:39:17.750 --> 05:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
program manager I see and f farm I may
 
05:39:19.788 --> 05:39:19.798 align:start position:0%
have left that out no no worries thank
 
05:39:21.910 --> 05:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
you hey represent
 
05:39:24.150 --> 05:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
ger thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:39:26.190 --> 05:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you had said that
 
05:39:28.990 --> 05:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
you know if you contacted a vet and they
 
05:39:30.948 --> 05:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
were a cat doctor for example that they
 
05:39:32.628 --> 05:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take a call to go out and look
 
05:39:36.110 --> 05:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
at at livestock for example u i I was
 
05:39:38.390 --> 05:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
doing a little bit of poking around
 
05:39:40.708 --> 05:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
online looking at the warrant
 
05:39:42.190 --> 05:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
information that was shared with us and
 
05:39:44.468 --> 05:39:44.478 align:start position:0%
it does seem that the veterinarian who
 
05:39:46.190 --> 05:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
was brought in in this case to look at
 
05:39:48.948 --> 05:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
Goats was a specialist in small animal
 
05:39:50.990 --> 05:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
internal medicine and whose experience
 
05:39:55.070 --> 05:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
was primarily in a um in a Veterinary
 
05:39:57.230 --> 05:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
situation that dealt with with uh
 
05:39:59.390 --> 05:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
domesticated pets are you referring to
 
05:40:02.868 --> 05:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
Dr Boer yes uh so yes so if I I'm sorry
 
05:40:04.390 --> 05:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
I didn't mean to cut you off I just
 
05:40:06.948 --> 05:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
didn't get to my question uh which is so
 
05:40:09.270 --> 05:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
do you think that that a doctor with
 
05:40:11.430 --> 05:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
that kind of training I don't know much
 
05:40:13.030 --> 05:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
about the transferability of Medical
 
05:40:15.190 --> 05:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
Training but somebody with that kind of
 
05:40:17.910 --> 05:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
experience and training is suitable to
 
05:40:19.788 --> 05:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
be making these kinds of serious
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
judgments with regards to farm animals
 
05:40:25.788 --> 05:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
so all veterinarians go to school to
 
05:40:28.110 --> 05:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
study all animals they learn about all
 
05:40:33.150 --> 05:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
animals when they're in um when they are
 
05:40:37.310 --> 05:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
um at school then they specialize um Dr
 
05:40:40.830 --> 05:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
lawyer was the the vet of record at a
 
05:40:43.708 --> 05:40:43.718 align:start position:0%
state fair for large animals previously
 
05:40:46.430 --> 05:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
and she is a USDA vet as well so she
 
05:40:48.270 --> 05:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
does have experience that currently she
 
05:40:51.670 --> 05:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
is practicing cats and dogs just like I
 
05:40:54.910 --> 05:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
used to be a police officer we all have
 
05:40:56.788 --> 05:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
past and some of us have more experience
 
05:40:58.910 --> 05:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
than others all right that helps thank
 
05:41:00.270 --> 05:41:00.280 align:start position:0%

05:41:02.910 --> 05:41:02.920 align:start position:0%

sure I appreciate it um now you you were
 
05:41:13.670 --> 05:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about the removal of Humane
 
05:41:17.070 --> 05:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
agents I don't remember seeing that in
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill itself is it
 
05:41:21.110 --> 05:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
referring to the fact that we you're
 
05:41:23.548 --> 05:41:23.558 align:start position:0%
we're asking for a Veterinary instead of
 
05:41:25.350 --> 05:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
somebody else who somebody designated as
 
05:41:26.830 --> 05:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
a Humane agent no in the bill it's
 
05:41:30.190 --> 05:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
Humane agent is struck out oh part of
 
05:41:31.788 --> 05:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
the language that was struck I didn't
 
05:41:33.310 --> 05:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
pay a lot of attention to that yeah
 
05:41:36.070 --> 05:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's a page one line
 
05:41:38.948 --> 05:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
2021 thank thank you um can you please
 
05:41:41.350 --> 05:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
tell me what a Humane agent is what the
 
05:41:43.868 --> 05:41:43.878 align:start position:0%
definition of a Humane agent is so we
 
05:41:48.750 --> 05:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
are um authorized by our um agency a
 
05:41:53.110 --> 05:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
Humane agency um to we receive
 
05:41:59.190 --> 05:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
complaints um and we are tasked with um
 
05:42:01.548 --> 05:42:01.558 align:start position:0%
deciding whether like you asked before
 
05:42:04.390 --> 05:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
whether the complaints are um Justified
 
05:42:07.910 --> 05:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
or not so a lot of times we act as
 
05:42:12.590 --> 05:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
um the middleman and we we um give these
 
05:42:15.070 --> 05:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
complaints to Animal Control Officers
 
05:42:17.708 --> 05:42:17.718 align:start position:0%
that you know are in different towns um
 
05:42:20.628 --> 05:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
or we try to determine the validity of
 
05:42:23.190 --> 05:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
the complaints ourselves so we are uh
 
05:42:25.468 --> 05:42:25.478 align:start position:0%
individuals that
 
05:42:28.230 --> 05:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
are set out
 
05:42:32.468 --> 05:42:32.478 align:start position:0%

Community um
 
05:43:19.070 --> 05:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
prejudices um it's been probably pretty

bad for the reputation I'm but but it
 
05:43:23.548 --> 05:43:23.558 align:start position:0%
sounds like there's a lot of um

SPCA um as a result of the handling of
 
05:43:36.430 --> 05:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
this case have you noticed um any any
 
05:43:38.830 --> 05:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
negative or negative feelings amongst
 
05:43:40.788 --> 05:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
the community since especially since you
 
05:43:42.708 --> 05:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
live in Lee at the same the same
 
05:43:44.230 --> 05:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
location have you noticed any backlash
 
05:43:47.628 --> 05:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
against the SPCA um I think Lisa would
 
05:43:50.468 --> 05:43:50.478 align:start position:0%
be better to speak to that um I think as
 
05:43:53.350 --> 05:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
far as an investigator I do not feel
 
05:43:56.628 --> 05:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
that we've had any issues um going out
 
05:43:58.948 --> 05:43:58.958 align:start position:0%
to other Farms if that's what you're um
 
05:44:02.230 --> 05:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know asking um we've had some people
 
05:44:05.590 --> 05:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
that I've spoken to um in Lee that
 
05:44:07.628 --> 05:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
weren't happy with what happened but
 
05:44:10.590 --> 05:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
also many of them um only had heard one
 
05:44:14.548 --> 05:44:14.558 align:start position:0%
side of the story um obviously under you
 
05:44:16.628 --> 05:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
know an any situation there's more than
 
05:44:20.468 --> 05:44:20.478 align:start position:0%
one side to every story um so with a a
 
05:44:22.350 --> 05:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
bigger under a larger understanding of
 
05:44:26.310 --> 05:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
the entire picture I think that it uh we
 
05:44:30.510 --> 05:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
were able to share um our side and I do
 
05:44:33.110 --> 05:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
understand that without charging Donna
 
05:44:35.590 --> 05:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
Le it led to
 
05:44:38.110 --> 05:44:38.120 align:start position:0%
more um
 
05:44:41.390 --> 05:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
just Stories being told on you know
 
05:44:44.310 --> 05:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
whoever side you were on so there was no
 
05:44:47.830 --> 05:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
um Court decision made on on what
 
05:44:51.948 --> 05:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
happened um but personally I've had no
 
05:44:54.150 --> 05:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
issues I've being the farm program
 
05:44:57.390 --> 05:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
manager I haven't received any personal
 
05:45:00.628 --> 05:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
um you know situations that were of
 
05:45:03.190 --> 05:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
concern okay thank
 
05:45:05.190 --> 05:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:45:07.510 --> 05:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you Mr chair
 
05:45:09.030 --> 05:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
you had said in your response to
 
05:45:11.670 --> 05:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative Scully that there were no
 
05:45:13.750 --> 05:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
training requirements for the SPCA in
 
05:45:15.310 --> 05:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire I'm wondering
 
05:45:16.750 --> 05:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
if you could answer although this is
 
05:45:19.270 --> 05:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
probably more appropriate for Lisa the
 
05:45:21.230 --> 05:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
people who are hired by the SPCA are
 
05:45:23.468 --> 05:45:23.478 align:start position:0%
they generally former police officers
 
05:45:25.788 --> 05:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
and things along those line that is one
 
05:45:30.070 --> 05:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
of um the things that Lisa um looks for
 
05:45:32.350 --> 05:45:32.360 align:start position:0%
when she's hiring hemain agents because
 
05:45:34.990 --> 05:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
05:45:38.390 --> 05:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
um we do have a background in
 
05:45:41.548 --> 05:45:41.558 align:start position:0%
investigations um and in law enforcement
 
05:45:46.830 --> 05:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
and law so we also try to on our own um
 
05:45:50.310 --> 05:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
continue to educate ourselves um we do
 
05:45:52.350 --> 05:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
take classes online um but there is no
 
05:45:55.070 --> 05:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
State requirement the SPCA isn't just
 
05:46:00.830 --> 05:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
no so um I have a question about uh one
 
05:46:08.788 --> 05:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
of the um there there are there are two
 
05:46:13.230 --> 05:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
areas in uh section 6448 that allow the
 
05:46:16.230 --> 05:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
seizure of animals uh one is when
 
05:46:19.350 --> 05:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
someone is being charged with a uh with
 
05:46:21.708 --> 05:46:21.718 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty the other is protective
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
custody and uh can you
 
05:46:27.590 --> 05:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
explain how those two work and what the
 
05:46:29.548 --> 05:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
respon the due process
 
05:46:33.990 --> 05:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh are under those so
 
05:46:34.000 --> 05:46:35.548 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh are under those so
um

05:46:35.548 --> 05:46:35.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:37.628 --> 05:46:37.638 align:start position:0%
obviously um
 
05:46:40.548 --> 05:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
when an animal is taken into protective
 
05:46:42.750 --> 05:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
custody if we're speaking about
 
05:46:45.590 --> 05:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
livestock um it doesn't matter if
 
05:46:49.070 --> 05:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
they're um under any circumstances with
 
05:46:51.110 --> 05:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
livestock they it has to be a
 
05:46:53.750 --> 05:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarian's decision um so it's not a
 
05:46:56.750 --> 05:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
law enforce even if the animal is dying
 
05:46:59.430 --> 05:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
in front of me and I am there if it is a
 
05:47:02.750 --> 05:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
horse I cannot seize that animal even to
 
05:47:04.750 --> 05:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
save its life unless I have a
 
05:47:06.350 --> 05:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
veterinarian's approval that has
 
05:47:07.868 --> 05:47:07.878 align:start position:0%
actually happened to me on more than one
 
05:47:10.990 --> 05:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
occasion and that is a very difficult
 
05:47:16.990 --> 05:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
situation to handle um so um and uh so
 
05:47:24.110 --> 05:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
animals are taken only without a warrant
 
05:47:25.708 --> 05:47:25.718 align:start position:0%
small animals are only taken without a
 
05:47:30.150 --> 05:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
warrant if they are in imminent danger
 
05:47:31.670 --> 05:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
um that is the only time that they are
 
05:47:35.390 --> 05:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
taken without a warrant um we do not nor
 
05:47:37.830 --> 05:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
do law enforcement go and just pluck
 
05:47:39.948 --> 05:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
animals from people's backyards that
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
does not happen um so animals are seized
 
05:47:45.750 --> 05:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
as evidence from a search warrant and
 
05:47:48.070 --> 05:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
they are taken into protective custody
 
05:47:51.548 --> 05:47:51.558 align:start position:0%
while the case proceeds um and they are
 
05:47:55.230 --> 05:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
the living evidence for that case um
 
05:47:58.030 --> 05:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
animals taken into protective custody um
 
05:48:00.310 --> 05:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's because they are not well
 
05:48:03.070 --> 05:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
and they need to be cared for properly
 
05:48:07.270 --> 05:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
um they will be taken and depending on
 
05:48:10.030 --> 05:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
what happens whether the Court decides
 
05:48:11.670 --> 05:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
the officers decide to go forward with
 
05:48:14.990 --> 05:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
charges or not the animals are returned
 
05:48:19.070 --> 05:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
afterwards if they if um the if they're
 
05:48:20.990 --> 05:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
not surrendered many times they are
 
05:48:25.110 --> 05:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
surrendered okay and if the
 
05:48:29.230 --> 05:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh if the animals are taken as evidence
 
05:48:32.270 --> 05:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
are the responsibilities in terms of
 
05:48:34.390 --> 05:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
what sort of changes may or may not be
 
05:48:37.390 --> 05:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
made to the animals legally if they are
 
05:48:40.190 --> 05:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
part of evidence being held we would
 
05:48:42.030 --> 05:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
take the animals and we would hold them
 
05:48:44.070 --> 05:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
as evidence the only thing we are
 
05:48:46.628 --> 05:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
allowed to do is keep them alive
 
05:48:49.230 --> 05:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
basically we provide necessary medical
 
05:48:52.868 --> 05:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
care and we feed and house them um we
 
05:48:54.468 --> 05:48:54.478 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed to alter them we aren't
 
05:48:56.390 --> 05:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to train them we aren't allowed
 
05:48:58.310 --> 05:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
to do anything with them until the case
 
05:49:01.230 --> 05:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
is disposed of okay so if they are
 
05:49:03.190 --> 05:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
euthanized does that consider is that
 
05:49:05.430 --> 05:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
considered being a change the only way
 
05:49:07.230 --> 05:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
we can euthanize an animal that is in
 
05:49:10.190 --> 05:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
protective custody or that is evidence
 
05:49:13.270 --> 05:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
we must petition the court or get
 
05:49:15.350 --> 05:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
permission from the owner of the animals
 
05:49:16.868 --> 05:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
even if they're being charged with a
 
05:49:19.990 --> 05:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
crime we do not euthanize
 
05:49:22.990 --> 05:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
animals without their knowledge okay
 
05:49:26.548 --> 05:49:26.558 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Penza uh thank
 
05:49:29.150 --> 05:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um that
 
05:49:32.430 --> 05:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
just brings up a question then so in in
 
05:49:34.230 --> 05:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
this case and I don't we don't want to
 
05:49:37.030 --> 05:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
get here to debate this case um you know
 
05:49:40.468 --> 05:49:40.478 align:start position:0%
22 animals when they were seized were um
 
05:49:43.750 --> 05:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
were killed so how do we explain that
 
05:49:46.910 --> 05:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:49.430 --> 05:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
surrendered the animals were surrendered
 
05:49:50.868 --> 05:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
after they were taken into protective
 
05:49:55.510 --> 05:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:58.070 --> 05:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
Donal I don't that that doesn't I don't
 
05:50:00.948 --> 05:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
know I'm sorry follow up I don't
 
05:50:02.830 --> 05:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
understand what you mean so the animals
 
05:50:06.070 --> 05:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
were seized the the two veterinarians on
 
05:50:06.080 --> 05:50:08.948 align:start position:0%
were seized the the two veterinarians on
scene

05:50:08.948 --> 05:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:10.750 --> 05:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
told law enforcement that the animals
 
05:50:12.310 --> 05:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
needed to be taken into protective
 
05:50:14.910 --> 05:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
custody MH the animals were taken into
 
05:50:17.910 --> 05:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
protective custody and then the animals
 
05:50:19.628 --> 05:50:19.638 align:start position:0%
were then surrendered to the New
 
05:50:19.638 --> 05:50:22.670 align:start position:0%
were then surrendered to the New
Hampshire

05:50:22.670 --> 05:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:25.750 --> 05:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
SPCA okay but that's not I'm talking
 
05:50:28.190 --> 05:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
about the 22 of them that were then
 
05:50:31.110 --> 05:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
killed and they were euthanized at the
 
05:50:33.230 --> 05:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation of a veterinarian after
 
05:50:34.628 --> 05:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
they were surrendered because they were
 
05:50:34.638 --> 05:50:40.708 align:start position:0%
they were surrendered because they were
suffering

05:50:40.708 --> 05:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:43.788 --> 05:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
05:50:51.110 --> 05:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:54.110 --> 05:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
you okay oh next uh I'd like to call
 
05:50:57.750 --> 05:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
Stacy Ober and um if people could keep
 
05:51:00.310 --> 05:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
their testimony on the short side uh
 
05:51:02.948 --> 05:51:02.958 align:start position:0%
that would be very good uh obviously
 
05:51:14.190 --> 05:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:15.628 --> 05:51:15.638 align:start position:0%

for the American Kennel Club I have some
 
05:51:24.948 --> 05:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
written testimony that's General I do
 
05:51:27.990 --> 05:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
think it's um such a useful opportunity
 
05:51:29.468 --> 05:51:29.478 align:start position:0%
to sit through the testimony so I want
 
05:51:32.030 --> 05:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
to tailor my oral testimony to you uh
 
05:51:34.270 --> 05:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
specific to some of what you heard
 
05:51:36.670 --> 05:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
today a few years ago the American
 
05:51:38.270 --> 05:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
Kennel Club worked closely with New
 
05:51:40.190 --> 05:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dogs and this committee on
 
05:51:43.190 --> 05:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
strengthening the animal cruelty statute
 
05:51:46.590 --> 05:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
and the work was done in a reflection of
 
05:51:50.468 --> 05:51:50.478 align:start position:0%
two uh dog cruelty cases one which ended
 
05:51:52.990 --> 05:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
in a conviction and another where the CH
 
05:51:55.510 --> 05:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
the charges had been dropped and so I
 
05:51:58.270 --> 05:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
want to just reiterate that you know the
 
05:51:59.948 --> 05:51:59.958 align:start position:0%
American Kennel Club does take a strong
 
05:52:02.670 --> 05:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
line on animal cruelty we have policies
 
05:52:05.868 --> 05:52:05.878 align:start position:0%
that suspend privileges and we actually
 
05:52:07.548 --> 05:52:07.558 align:start position:0%
have an invest tigation inspection
 
05:52:10.310 --> 05:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
program most people don't know about and
 
05:52:12.350 --> 05:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of the number of dogs someone
 
05:52:13.868 --> 05:52:13.878 align:start position:0%
owns if they're treating a dog
 
05:52:16.310 --> 05:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
negligently or cruy they should be held
 
05:52:18.310 --> 05:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
responsible there are Provisions in
 
05:52:21.270 --> 05:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
house 616 that we support because I
 
05:52:23.868 --> 05:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
believe it's strengthens the language
 
05:52:25.628 --> 05:52:25.638 align:start position:0%
that was adopted in the work with this
 
05:52:27.590 --> 05:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
committee a couple of years ago so I
 
05:52:30.868 --> 05:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to just highlight what those
 
05:52:33.788 --> 05:52:33.798 align:start position:0%
were um and I think the bill will
 
05:52:36.110 --> 05:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
clarify the proper procedure and some
 
05:52:38.468 --> 05:52:38.478 align:start position:0%
awareness around the statute's
 
05:52:41.270 --> 05:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
provisions um you heard that there's a
 
05:52:44.030 --> 05:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
focus on educating and not bringing
 
05:52:46.910 --> 05:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
charges the animal cruelty case the dog
 
05:52:49.468 --> 05:52:49.478 align:start position:0%
cruelty case that resulted in a
 
05:52:52.390 --> 05:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
conviction was a mental health issue the
 
05:52:56.310 --> 05:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
individual in fact um was ordered by the
 
05:52:58.510 --> 05:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
court to undergo some psychological
 
05:53:01.990 --> 05:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
treatment so in the event the animal
 
05:53:03.708 --> 05:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
neglect and cruelty is the result of a
 
05:53:05.868 --> 05:53:05.878 align:start position:0%
mental health condition in fact it may
 
05:53:08.430 --> 05:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
be wise to go forward with charges so
 
05:53:10.350 --> 05:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
that treatment could ensue in that
 
05:53:12.590 --> 05:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
situation rather than allowing for
 
05:53:14.030 --> 05:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
instance someone who's hoarding animals
 
05:53:16.948 --> 05:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
to go out and um continue to collect
 
05:53:20.910 --> 05:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
them the um Provisions that were
 
05:53:22.590 --> 05:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
included and I want to turn to in the
 
05:53:24.548 --> 05:53:24.558 align:start position:0%
bill if you look
 
05:53:26.628 --> 05:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
at line
 
05:53:28.868 --> 05:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
seven a person charged under this
 
05:53:30.548 --> 05:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
section May petition the court to seek
 
05:53:32.270 --> 05:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
an examination of the Animals by a
 
05:53:34.788 --> 05:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
veterinarian licensed of his or her
 
05:53:36.750 --> 05:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
choice at the expense of the person in
 
05:53:39.190 --> 05:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
charged that language was put in statute
 
05:53:41.708 --> 05:53:41.718 align:start position:0%
as a reflection of a dog owner whose
 
05:53:44.390 --> 05:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
whose dogs had been seized uh one of the
 
05:53:49.150 --> 05:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
dogs they did charge for neglect and in
 
05:53:51.788 --> 05:53:51.798 align:start position:0%
fact the dog was an elderly dog that had
 
05:53:53.948 --> 05:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
a medical issue and was under the care
 
05:53:56.750 --> 05:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
and treatment of a veterinarian so I
 
05:53:59.670 --> 05:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
think these cases can be quite complex
 
05:54:03.030 --> 05:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
and um they can be quite emotional in
 
05:54:05.190 --> 05:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
that instance my understanding is the
 
05:54:08.468 --> 05:54:08.478 align:start position:0%
charges were eventually dropped um and
 
05:54:10.548 --> 05:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
the individual had to enter into kind of
 
05:54:12.910 --> 05:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
a confidentiality agreement to not talk
 
05:54:14.150 --> 05:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
about it because it was quite
 
05:54:16.788 --> 05:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
embarrassing uh that the Humane Society
 
05:54:18.430 --> 05:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
had gone forward with these charges and
 
05:54:21.350 --> 05:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
drawn it out the legal expense the
 
05:54:23.350 --> 05:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
negative media coverage it was it was
 
05:54:23.360 --> 05:54:25.708 align:start position:0%
negative media coverage it was it was
quite

05:54:25.708 --> 05:54:25.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:28.590 --> 05:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
ugly so sometimes people are innocent
 
05:54:30.788 --> 05:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
and um that's why we put this language
 
05:54:32.390 --> 05:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
in there and I think it would be a great
 
05:54:35.628 --> 05:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
help to add the sentence that making the
 
05:54:37.190 --> 05:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
person aware
 
05:54:39.670 --> 05:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
um that they have the opportunity to
 
05:54:42.270 --> 05:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
hire a veterinarian the other piece that
 
05:54:44.468 --> 05:54:44.478 align:start position:0%
we put into law was to expedite these
 
05:54:46.948 --> 05:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
cases so that that was in the best
 
05:54:48.868 --> 05:54:48.878 align:start position:0%
interest for everyone the animals the
 
05:54:51.030 --> 05:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
defendant and prosecution and to have
 
05:54:53.270 --> 05:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
the court conduct a status hearing
 
05:54:57.510 --> 05:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
within 14 days of the seizure what I
 
05:54:59.590 --> 05:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
don't know because I'm not a prosecutor
 
05:55:01.788 --> 05:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
or in law enforcement
 
05:55:04.750 --> 05:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
is whether or not the status Hearing in
 
05:55:07.830 --> 05:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
front of the court requires charges to
 
05:55:10.788 --> 05:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
be filed at that time my experience in
 
05:55:12.590 --> 05:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
covering New England is that sometimes
 
05:55:15.628 --> 05:55:15.638 align:start position:0%
animals are seized and it can be weeks
 
05:55:18.830 --> 05:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
or months before charges are actually
 
05:55:22.430 --> 05:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
filed um so I just wanted to flag that
 
05:55:24.430 --> 05:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
for you all and whether or not there
 
05:55:26.788 --> 05:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
would be uh a desire
 
05:55:28.910 --> 05:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
to you know I don't know whether that's
 
05:55:31.708 --> 05:55:31.718 align:start position:0%
appropriate or logical to be able to
 
05:55:34.708 --> 05:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
ensure that a period is um given for
 
05:55:38.590 --> 05:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
charges to either be filed or or not
 
05:55:38.600 --> 05:55:41.350 align:start position:0%
charges to either be filed or or not
filed

05:55:41.350 --> 05:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
filed
 
05:55:44.270 --> 05:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
um the last piece I wanted to highlight
 
05:55:46.788 --> 05:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
is the language that you've been talking
 
05:55:49.628 --> 05:55:49.638 align:start position:0%
about on the page
 
05:55:52.990 --> 05:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
one the new subparagraph starting in
 
05:55:53.000 --> 05:55:55.708 align:start position:0%
one the new subparagraph starting in
line

05:55:55.708 --> 05:55:55.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:58.350 --> 05:55:58.360 align:start position:0%
13 no confiscated animals shall be
 
05:55:59.628 --> 05:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
altered without the notorized
 
05:56:01.788 --> 05:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
authorization of the owner from whom the
 
05:56:04.708 --> 05:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:06.990 --> 05:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
confiscated um sorry the next sentence
 
05:56:09.030 --> 05:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
nor shall such animal or animals be used
 
05:56:11.110 --> 05:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
in any manner to solicit donations or to
 
05:56:14.590 --> 05:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
fundraise by any individual or
 
05:56:17.670 --> 05:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
organization um that language I think
 
05:56:20.548 --> 05:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
would be incredibly um important and and
 
05:56:23.590 --> 05:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
useful even if you clarified that that
 
05:56:27.230 --> 05:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
sentence is with respect to any uh
 
05:56:29.070 --> 05:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
individual or organization that has
 
05:56:30.670 --> 05:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
custody of the
 
05:56:33.030 --> 05:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
animal rather than the defendant who
 
05:56:35.868 --> 05:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
might be doing a a you know some kind of
 
05:56:37.948 --> 05:56:37.958 align:start position:0%
a fundraising which does happen when
 
05:56:39.830 --> 05:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
somebody's faced with a situation of
 
05:56:42.230 --> 05:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
having to hire legal counsel um the
 
05:56:43.548 --> 05:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
reason I think it's
 
05:56:45.708 --> 05:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
important is that you've heard even from
 
05:56:47.468 --> 05:56:47.478 align:start position:0%
your own committee members some of the
 
05:56:50.230 --> 05:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
harassment that has taken place um in
 
05:56:52.548 --> 05:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
the media sometimes these pictures are
 
05:56:55.708 --> 05:56:55.718 align:start position:0%
used on social media to um create an
 
05:56:58.150 --> 05:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
emotional appeal for donations and I
 
05:57:00.350 --> 05:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
want to just pause and make an analogy
 
05:57:00.360 --> 05:57:01.270 align:start position:0%
want to just pause and make an analogy
for

05:57:01.270 --> 05:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:57:03.830 --> 05:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
you in the event law enforcement let's
 
05:57:07.070 --> 05:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
say needed to hire an expert assistant
 
05:57:09.190 --> 05:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
for an investigation let's say it was a
 
05:57:10.910 --> 05:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
white collar crime and they needed to
 
05:57:12.590 --> 05:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
hire an accountant to look whether the
 
05:57:13.990 --> 05:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
books were being cooked or something
 
05:57:14.000 --> 05:57:14.750 align:start position:0%
books were being cooked or something
like

05:57:14.750 --> 05:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:57:17.150 --> 05:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
that typically what happens is law
 
05:57:19.670 --> 05:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement will enter a non-disclosure
 
05:57:21.788 --> 05:57:21.798 align:start position:0%
agreement that professional is not
 
05:57:24.750 --> 05:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to assist with the investigation
 
05:57:26.830 --> 05:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
and then go out and call People magazine
 
05:57:29.510 --> 05:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
or somebody else you know and get paid
 
05:57:31.548 --> 05:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
for sharing the information that they
 
05:57:34.548 --> 05:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
only have been exposed to or acquired by
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
virtue of their as an expert assistant
 
05:57:41.270 --> 05:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
and so um I think there were a number of
 
05:57:44.310 --> 05:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
negative consequences of it um to allow
 
05:57:46.788 --> 05:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
that to happen and that would include
 
05:57:50.830 --> 05:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
not only um harassment or intentional
 
05:57:53.310 --> 05:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
infliction of emotional distress maybe
 
05:57:55.628 --> 05:57:55.638 align:start position:0%
um also compromising the investigation
 
05:57:59.510 --> 05:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
itself and certainly it lends to a
 
05:58:01.590 --> 05:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
perception of impropriety if you're
 
05:58:03.350 --> 05:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
going to allow the organization that
 
05:58:05.468 --> 05:58:05.478 align:start position:0%
filed the complaint to then go in and do
 
05:58:07.310 --> 05:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
the investigation and then use that
 
05:58:09.708 --> 05:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
evidence to raise funds and make
 
05:58:12.468 --> 05:58:12.478 align:start position:0%
donations it creates a real appearance
 
05:58:14.788 --> 05:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
of impropriety so thanks for letting me
 
05:58:16.708 --> 05:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
just cover those points with you
 
05:58:19.310 --> 05:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
today thank you and uh would you be
 
05:58:21.548 --> 05:58:21.558 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions absolutely are
 
05:58:24.070 --> 05:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:26.070 --> 05:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none looks like you're
 
05:58:27.750 --> 05:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
off the hook all right thank you next
 
05:58:30.510 --> 05:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call Kurt aronberg from the
 
05:58:39.628 --> 05:58:39.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:41.788 --> 05:58:41.798 align:start position:0%
good afternoon representative Bixby and
 
05:58:45.628 --> 05:58:45.638 align:start position:0%
the committee uh I'll be brief I
 
05:58:49.708 --> 05:58:49.718 align:start position:0%
uh I just think it's important
 
05:58:54.628 --> 05:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
uh that it's said here today that the
 
05:58:57.990 --> 05:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
SPCA the Animal Rescue League and all of
 
05:59:00.708 --> 05:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
the other animal welfare organizations
 
05:59:03.628 --> 05:59:03.638 align:start position:0%
that take care of animals that are
 
05:59:07.548 --> 05:59:07.558 align:start position:0%
involved in animal adoption that do
 
05:59:11.468 --> 05:59:11.478 align:start position:0%
animal rescues on a daily basis basis
 
05:59:14.110 --> 05:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
Tona and Michelle are
 
05:59:16.948 --> 05:59:16.958 align:start position:0%
essential parts of the law enforcement
 
05:59:21.310 --> 05:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
of this state that takes care of animals
 
05:59:23.030 --> 05:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
and without them there would be more
 
05:59:25.430 --> 05:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
animals suffering in this
 
05:59:30.110 --> 05:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
state um to have this bill attack these
 
05:59:34.270 --> 05:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
organizations to deny them uh nonprofit
 
05:59:38.070 --> 05:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:42.150 --> 05:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
and to say that they cannot be involved
 
05:59:45.628 --> 05:59:45.638 align:start position:0%
in animal rescue large animal rescues in
 
05:59:48.948 --> 05:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
this state should not be what we do here
 
05:59:49.948 --> 05:59:49.958 align:start position:0%
in this
 
05:59:53.390 --> 05:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
committee um so I thought that needed to
 
05:59:55.830 --> 05:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
be said here today I was not going to
 
05:59:59.708 --> 05:59:59.718 align:start position:0%
testify I think the experts are clearly
 
06:00:01.110 --> 06:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
here to
 
06:00:04.150 --> 06:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
testify um on both
 
06:00:09.230 --> 06:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
sides um but I do think that this bill
 
06:00:11.110 --> 06:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
in its form right
 
06:00:14.310 --> 06:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
now takes away some of the tools and and
 
06:00:16.510 --> 06:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying and this committee is a big
 
06:00:18.990 --> 06:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
part of that also the governor's
 
06:00:21.230 --> 06:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
Commission on the Humane treatment of
 
06:00:23.868 --> 06:00:23.878 align:start position:0%
animals is very concerned which I'm a
 
06:00:27.788 --> 06:00:27.798 align:start position:0%
member of very concerned with the state
 
06:00:30.590 --> 06:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
of animal protection and the law
 
06:00:32.628 --> 06:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement Community where this
 
06:00:34.750 --> 06:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
committee is working on that in other
 
06:00:34.760 --> 06:00:36.670 align:start position:0%
committee is working on that in other
areas

06:00:36.670 --> 06:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
areas
 
06:00:39.070 --> 06:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh I would say this bill in many ways is
 
06:00:42.708 --> 06:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
at odds with that effort and and and
 
06:00:44.910 --> 06:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
that's all I want to say today thank you
 
06:00:46.830 --> 06:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um would you be willing to
 
06:00:48.230 --> 06:00:48.240 align:start position:0%

06:00:50.310 --> 06:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
to take questions thanks thank
 
06:00:53.868 --> 06:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
you next I like to call uh Chuck Cox
 
06:00:53.878 --> 06:01:03.150 align:start position:0%
you next I like to call uh Chuck Cox
from

06:01:03.150 --> 06:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:07.070 --> 06:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
Lee yeah Chuck Cox uh tuck away Farm Lee
 
06:01:10.350 --> 06:01:10.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I'm certainly in
 
06:01:12.390 --> 06:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
support of the bill I think there have
 
06:01:15.230 --> 06:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
been some uh I've been personally
 
06:01:18.910 --> 06:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
involved well you know with the things
 
06:01:21.990 --> 06:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
that have been going on in Lee um I
 
06:01:24.110 --> 06:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
think the first thing when I heard this
 
06:01:27.390 --> 06:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
news that there was some herd of goats
 
06:01:30.830 --> 06:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
that was being seized for Mal treatment
 
06:01:32.990 --> 06:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
it never crossed my mind that it would
 
06:01:35.628 --> 06:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
have been Donna Le's Farm cuz I know
 
06:01:38.590 --> 06:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
what was happening so that was you know
 
06:01:40.788 --> 06:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
just you know who who could have goats
 
06:01:43.110 --> 06:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
that would been mistreated in
 
06:01:47.430 --> 06:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
Lee um I guess the main thing
 
06:01:52.910 --> 06:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:56.510 --> 06:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
the perception that we have of people in
 
06:01:58.390 --> 06:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
general and it may be an educational
 
06:02:01.548 --> 06:02:01.558 align:start position:0%
thing or or whatnot of what
 
06:02:05.590 --> 06:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
is um you got complaints from people
 
06:02:07.390 --> 06:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
they see an animal they think oh that's
 
06:02:11.310 --> 06:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
being mistr and as a farm you know we're
 
06:02:13.628 --> 06:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
try to be as open as we can to you know
 
06:02:16.070 --> 06:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
public and have people in but we were
 
06:02:19.468 --> 06:02:19.478 align:start position:0%
certainly getting gun shy we have some U
 
06:02:23.390 --> 06:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
Kaden sheep which shed their wool
 
06:02:26.030 --> 06:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not shorn but they
 
06:02:29.430 --> 06:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
shed the wool and they look horrible at
 
06:02:32.110 --> 06:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
that point and if you get someone coming
 
06:02:33.868 --> 06:02:33.878 align:start position:0%
in and saying oh gee
 
06:02:36.670 --> 06:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
they're you know they're and there sheep
 
06:02:38.910 --> 06:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
are falling apart and stuff and we get
 
06:02:42.110 --> 06:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
people come in and this the same thing
 
06:02:44.150 --> 06:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh we've had a number of horses and we
 
06:02:46.990 --> 06:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
keep them some they get old and
 
06:02:48.628 --> 06:02:48.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes you just can't keep weight on
 
06:02:51.110 --> 06:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
them and do you have to put them back
 
06:02:55.070 --> 06:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
where no one can see them that you know
 
06:02:57.670 --> 06:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
these being they're getting full care
 
06:03:00.230 --> 06:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
that they can get full food and and
 
06:03:02.590 --> 06:03:02.600 align:start position:0%
everything else but you get this feeling
 
06:03:04.830 --> 06:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
that someone's going to come up and you
 
06:03:07.750 --> 06:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
know say you're m treating these these
 
06:03:11.750 --> 06:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
animals um I can go on uh you we also
 
06:03:14.670 --> 06:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
keep the hounds for the Wentworth hunt
 
06:03:18.070 --> 06:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know we have you know very
 
06:03:20.628 --> 06:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
good care on all of that but I think the
 
06:03:22.310 --> 06:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
other thing I think that's underneath a
 
06:03:25.948 --> 06:03:25.958 align:start position:0%
lot of this is it's um I think we get
 
06:03:27.990 --> 06:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
sort of the animal
 
06:03:31.670 --> 06:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
rights um thing coming in too that oh
 
06:03:33.070 --> 06:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
gee you know I've been involved with
 
06:03:34.830 --> 06:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
sled dogs too and they said oh gee those
 
06:03:36.990 --> 06:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
sled dogs are Chang up they're being
 
06:03:39.390 --> 06:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
mistreated nothing those sled dogs like
 
06:03:41.310 --> 06:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
better than in to run and get hitched up
 
06:03:43.910 --> 06:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
and go the same with the hounds and
 
06:03:45.430 --> 06:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying well gee they're kept in
 
06:03:47.628 --> 06:03:47.638 align:start position:0%
the pen they're not getting they're
 
06:03:49.230 --> 06:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
getting well cared for they're getting
 
06:03:51.030 --> 06:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
their food and the people that are
 
06:03:53.830 --> 06:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
keeping these animals are very concerned
 
06:03:55.788 --> 06:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
that that's their Prime thing and I
 
06:03:58.310 --> 06:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
think we just got to watch that
 
06:04:03.030 --> 06:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
um uh we've got to uh educate the public
 
06:04:05.430 --> 06:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know that uh you know they don't
 
06:04:05.440 --> 06:04:06.350 align:start position:0%
I don't know that uh you know they don't
know

06:04:06.350 --> 06:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:04:08.270 --> 06:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
you know what is proper care they get
 
06:04:11.590 --> 06:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
this other idea of you know
 
06:04:14.750 --> 06:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
um uh that they need all this or that
 
06:04:17.110 --> 06:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
and the you know the Care on horses and
 
06:04:18.990 --> 06:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
what that uh you know they provide
 
06:04:21.708 --> 06:04:21.718 align:start position:0%
shelter but often you worst thing
 
06:04:24.310 --> 06:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
they're standing out in the in the wind
 
06:04:26.110 --> 06:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
and stuff and they're happier there than
 
06:04:28.270 --> 06:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
they are being confined other places so
 
06:04:30.590 --> 06:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
I think there's a lot of this thing that
 
06:04:33.110 --> 06:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
has to be very uh watched very closely
 
06:04:37.628 --> 06:04:37.638 align:start position:0%
that uh some people's
 
06:04:40.708 --> 06:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
um um feeling of what is proper care and
 
06:04:42.628 --> 06:04:42.638 align:start position:0%
what is is not I think it's very
 
06:04:44.430 --> 06:04:44.440 align:start position:0%
different in the farm
 
06:04:48.190 --> 06:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
situation um and
 
06:04:51.468 --> 06:04:51.478 align:start position:0%
uh well I guess I'll just uh leave it at
 
06:04:53.510 --> 06:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
that uh would you be willing to take
 
06:04:55.910 --> 06:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
questions I would are there any are
 
06:04:57.190 --> 06:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
there any
 
06:05:00.150 --> 06:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
questions I guess you're off the hook
 
06:05:03.868 --> 06:05:03.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:16.750 --> 06:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:19.230 --> 06:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
McCarthy and if I pronounced that wrong
 
06:05:44.948 --> 06:05:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:46.910 --> 06:05:46.920 align:start position:0%

consideration I'm retired in law
 
06:06:11.830 --> 06:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement and have been and will
 
06:06:13.910 --> 06:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
continue to protect any animal that has
 
06:06:17.430 --> 06:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
been neglected as a Humane officer the
 
06:06:19.230 --> 06:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire I am deeply
 
06:06:21.548 --> 06:06:21.558 align:start position:0%
concerned about negative impact this
 
06:06:24.190 --> 06:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
legislation could have with Bill
 
06:06:26.270 --> 06:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
616 throughout my career as law
 
06:06:29.310 --> 06:06:29.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement as a Humane officer I
 
06:06:31.468 --> 06:06:31.478 align:start position:0%
investigated animals associated with
 
06:06:34.030 --> 06:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
large small and farm
 
06:06:36.310 --> 06:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
animals then the last 10 years the
 
06:06:38.628 --> 06:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
growth of neglect towards dogs horses
 
06:06:42.030 --> 06:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
and farm animals has increased during my
 
06:06:43.310 --> 06:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
investigation I've learned that the
 
06:06:45.590 --> 06:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
owners sometimes cannot financially care
 
06:06:47.510 --> 06:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
for the animals or give the animals
 
06:06:50.310 --> 06:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
proper care sustenance or
 
06:06:52.548 --> 06:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
shelter within the last three years has
 
06:06:54.230 --> 06:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
a Humane officer investigated cases

be emaciated and die
 
06:07:08.788 --> 06:07:08.798 align:start position:0%
within the last year I've had a case
 
06:07:11.468 --> 06:07:11.478 align:start position:0%
involved in goats infected of the herd
 
06:07:14.190 --> 06:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
due to a chronic crippling disease
 
06:07:16.788 --> 06:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
CAE and their newborns dehydrated
 
06:07:18.708 --> 06:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
because their moms could not even walk
 
06:07:20.788 --> 06:07:20.798 align:start position:0%
or get to drink
 
06:07:23.390 --> 06:07:23.400 align:start position:0%

police departments and other
 
06:07:33.510 --> 06:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
agencies house Bel 616 would limit my
 
06:07:35.670 --> 06:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
ability to investigate and protect
 
06:07:37.670 --> 06:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
animals that could have consequences
 
06:07:39.590 --> 06:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
with a negative
 
06:07:43.830 --> 06:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
outcome instead of Bill 66 616 I urge to
 
06:07:46.150 --> 06:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
support an alternative solution with a
 
06:07:48.548 --> 06:07:48.558 align:start position:0%
more effective and fair approach I
 
06:07:50.390 --> 06:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that you vote against
 
06:07:53.628 --> 06:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
the bill 616 and work towards policies
 
06:07:55.510 --> 06:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
that better serve our community and
 
06:07:58.590 --> 06:07:58.600 align:start position:0%

06:08:22.628 --> 06:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
retired in
 
06:08:25.468 --> 06:08:25.478 align:start position:0%
2016 I started with the Pope Memorial

SPCA in stratum I'm sorry in conquered
 
06:08:30.910 --> 06:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
uh for six and a half years and
 
06:08:32.830 --> 06:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
transferred over to stratum and I've
 
06:08:37.548 --> 06:08:37.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:40.190 --> 06:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions I do have

to add one more thing oh certainly Mr
 
06:08:46.590 --> 06:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
chair uh as for uh education for us we
 
06:08:49.150 --> 06:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
have the ability to go further with
 
06:08:52.310 --> 06:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
education on Animal Welfare called
 
06:08:53.948 --> 06:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
 national animal Control
 
06:08:57.310 --> 06:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
Association n Academy UNH and other
 
06:09:01.628 --> 06:09:01.638 align:start position:0%
agencies and online uh training for
 
06:09:06.310 --> 06:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
animals and so forth okay thank you
 
06:09:10.190 --> 06:09:10.200 align:start position:0%

06:09:12.788 --> 06:09:12.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
06:09:24.628 --> 06:09:24.638 align:start position:0%

06:09:32.670 --> 06:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
pillow thank you all of you for
 
06:09:36.430 --> 06:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
listening um this is very difficult
 
06:09:40.788 --> 06:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
because I can imagine myself
 
06:09:43.468 --> 06:09:43.478 align:start position:0%
um and what what would happen if
 
06:09:45.548 --> 06:09:45.558 align:start position:0%
somebody decided something was wrong
 
06:09:47.788 --> 06:09:47.798 align:start position:0%
like using a pack bed for the animals
 
06:09:49.948 --> 06:09:49.958 align:start position:0%
which I do
 
06:09:54.150 --> 06:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
um Farms are like homes and
 
06:09:57.390 --> 06:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
houses very rarely are they completely
 
06:10:00.990 --> 06:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
perfectly picked up clean and neat
 
06:10:02.910 --> 06:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
except when you know that there's
 
06:10:02.920 --> 06:10:04.310 align:start position:0%
except when you know that there's
company

06:10:04.310 --> 06:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
company
 
06:10:07.708 --> 06:10:07.718 align:start position:0%
coming because it's an ongoing
 
06:10:12.070 --> 06:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
process so I can't believe that um Donna
 
06:10:17.110 --> 06:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
Le's situation was um B really bad and
 
06:10:19.390 --> 06:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
causing problems but I do understand
 
06:10:21.868 --> 06:10:21.878 align:start position:0%
when the equipment breaks and you can't
 
06:10:24.788 --> 06:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
get it fixed um that's as far as you can
 
06:10:26.990 --> 06:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
go and when you have a Pack the only
 
06:10:30.150 --> 06:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
time that is really really smelly is
 
06:10:32.030 --> 06:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
when you're halfway through doing it
 
06:10:34.030 --> 06:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
because you've opened it up I just want
 
06:10:35.510 --> 06:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
to explain that cuz that has doesn't
 
06:10:38.948 --> 06:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
come up I'm one of the people who um
 
06:10:42.430 --> 06:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
definit helped craft the part about um
 
06:10:45.548 --> 06:10:45.558 align:start position:0%
the police need need to be trained which
 
06:10:48.110 --> 06:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
isn't another bill you're looking at but
 
06:10:51.430 --> 06:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's connected to this so I support this
 
06:10:51.440 --> 06:10:53.510 align:start position:0%
it's connected to this so I support this
bill

06:10:53.510 --> 06:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:10:56.150 --> 06:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
completely I've heard a lot today that's
 
06:10:57.910 --> 06:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's extremely upsetting and I've
 
06:11:00.190 --> 06:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
heard a lot that uh is totally
 
06:11:02.510 --> 06:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
contradictory and so it's really hard to
 
06:11:04.830 --> 06:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
know where the truth is I do know that
 
06:11:07.350 --> 06:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
if you've ever if you've never heard a
 
06:11:10.430 --> 06:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
goat scream you've you've really missed
 
06:11:17.190 --> 06:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
it um it's kind of it's really bad um so
 
06:11:20.190 --> 06:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
what I all I think I can add today is
 
06:11:22.230 --> 06:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
I'm really appreciative for all of you
 
06:11:24.830 --> 06:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
spending some time trying to help us um
 
06:11:29.150 --> 06:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
solve this problem the reason that I'm
 
06:11:32.190 --> 06:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
in favor of particularly the police part
 
06:11:35.310 --> 06:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
of having um jurisdiction but also
 
06:11:35.320 --> 06:11:36.430 align:start position:0%
of having um jurisdiction but also
having

06:11:36.430 --> 06:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
having
 
06:11:39.990 --> 06:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
training is because people have uh as
 
06:11:41.830 --> 06:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
they talk about stories like this have
 
06:11:44.990 --> 06:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
said oh how could that poor woman have
 
06:11:47.350 --> 06:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
let them take the
 
06:11:52.030 --> 06:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
animals and I said well picture
 
06:11:55.590 --> 06:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
this Suddenly at your
 
06:11:58.670 --> 06:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
farm a number of policemen show
 
06:12:02.390 --> 06:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
up and they have an official paper that
 
06:12:05.430 --> 06:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
says they can do this
 
06:12:08.230 --> 06:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
you're not I wouldn't be thinking at all
 
06:12:10.750 --> 06:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
I I would just be so horrified and so
 
06:12:13.628 --> 06:12:13.638 align:start position:0%
brokenhearted that um I wouldn't be able
 
06:12:16.030 --> 06:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
to think and that question did come up
 
06:12:18.350 --> 06:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
several times so I wanted to answer it
 
06:12:22.590 --> 06:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
what I think the police being trained
 
06:12:26.110 --> 06:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
and the police being having to have real
 
06:12:27.990 --> 06:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
credentials and real papers when they
 
06:12:30.150 --> 06:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
come is there
 
06:12:34.390 --> 06:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
because um we don't have a country that
 
06:12:35.948 --> 06:12:35.958 align:start position:0%
runs with the
 
06:12:38.310 --> 06:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
gestapo and sometimes that's what some
 
06:12:40.430 --> 06:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
of this seems like and I know I'm
 
06:12:43.350 --> 06:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
talking about feelings but there are
 
06:12:43.360 --> 06:12:44.708 align:start position:0%
talking about feelings but there are
feelings

06:12:44.708 --> 06:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
feelings
 
06:12:44.718 --> 06:12:46.750 align:start position:0%
feelings
here

06:12:46.750 --> 06:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:12:50.510 --> 06:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
um I just can't imagine being in that
 
06:12:54.230 --> 06:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
situation but as the story
 
06:12:58.310 --> 06:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
unfolds also can't believe that people
 
06:13:02.670 --> 06:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
actually were knowledgeable people who
 
06:13:06.110 --> 06:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
allowed lactating animals
 
06:13:10.070 --> 06:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
be separated from not only their babies
 
06:13:11.910 --> 06:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
which were probably getting milk some of
 
06:13:11.920 --> 06:13:12.750 align:start position:0%
which were probably getting milk some of
the

06:13:12.750 --> 06:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:13:17.430 --> 06:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
time from in natural ways but
 
06:13:21.230 --> 06:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
also that they would be put taken to a
 
06:13:22.350 --> 06:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
place where they weren't going to be
 
06:13:24.670 --> 06:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
milked properly and it did come up once
 
06:13:28.830 --> 06:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
or twice today that um that didn't
 
06:13:30.910 --> 06:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
happen and that was part of it sounded
 
06:13:33.830 --> 06:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
like that was part of why they did
 
06:13:35.708 --> 06:13:35.718 align:start position:0%
euthanize those animals
 
06:13:38.430 --> 06:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
that's just uncalled for that that's
 
06:13:42.230 --> 06:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
just out of line that's just um not
 
06:13:46.030 --> 06:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
right and so one of the solutions that I
 
06:13:48.670 --> 06:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
think there is is as long as we have the
 
06:13:51.270 --> 06:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
chain of command of the police and the
 
06:13:54.270 --> 06:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
judge with the papers is that those
 
06:13:56.468 --> 06:13:56.478 align:start position:0%
people do need to be trained and so I
 
06:13:58.070 --> 06:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
think that that's part of what we were
 
06:14:01.628 --> 06:14:01.638 align:start position:0%
trying to say is that there are some
 
06:14:04.670 --> 06:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful training programs out there
 
06:14:07.110 --> 06:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
and the we need to have police get that
 
06:14:09.628 --> 06:14:09.638 align:start position:0%
training so what happens we come to the
 
06:14:12.110 --> 06:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
solution that we always come to in many
 
06:14:15.230 --> 06:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
many situations we need to have some
 
06:14:17.910 --> 06:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
more funds and some more training and
 
06:14:21.430 --> 06:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
some better nicer thinking for this
 
06:14:23.150 --> 06:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
there are a whole bunch of things I
 
06:14:26.390 --> 06:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
could say more on but um there isn't
 
06:14:29.230 --> 06:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
time and I appreciate your time we need
 
06:14:32.910 --> 06:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
to pass things in this bill that will
 
06:14:36.230 --> 06:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
help us prevent
 
06:14:39.350 --> 06:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
mistakes being made which is the real
 
06:14:42.350 --> 06:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
cruelty to animals cu the cruelest thing
 
06:14:45.788 --> 06:14:45.798 align:start position:0%
to animals is to take them away from
 
06:14:49.190 --> 06:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
where is been home where they have been
 
06:14:52.110 --> 06:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
getting the right feed and they don't
 
06:14:54.070 --> 06:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
have to change their feed and change
 
06:14:58.590 --> 06:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
their care um and that's all I I mean I
 
06:15:01.350 --> 06:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
could go into a loot lot of other but it
 
06:15:03.830 --> 06:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
I just hope you all will look at things
 
06:15:06.910 --> 06:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
and um I'm sad to see that there only
 
06:15:09.628 --> 06:15:09.638 align:start position:0%
half of the chairs left full yeah it is
 
06:15:11.830 --> 06:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
getting a bit late um yes so thank you
 
06:15:15.548 --> 06:15:15.558 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I have a question uh
 
06:15:17.110 --> 06:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
there is something that is not in this
 
06:15:19.948 --> 06:15:19.958 align:start position:0%
bill uh there is currently a statute
 
06:15:23.390 --> 06:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
that says that it is illegal to separate
 
06:15:23.400 --> 06:15:25.230 align:start position:0%
that says that it is illegal to separate
a

06:15:25.230 --> 06:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:15:27.910 --> 06:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
um I think it's the moment it says a
 
06:15:30.948 --> 06:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
cult from its Dam but it should we're
 
06:15:33.868 --> 06:15:33.878 align:start position:0%
changing that to F but um that is
 
06:15:36.030 --> 06:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
specifically for Ean do you think that
 
06:15:39.110 --> 06:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
should be broadened to other uh
 
06:15:39.120 --> 06:15:40.750 align:start position:0%
should be broadened to other uh
livestock

06:15:40.750 --> 06:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
livestock
 
06:15:43.270 --> 06:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
species if that's what we need to do it
 
06:15:45.910 --> 06:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't need to happen but it
 
06:15:48.750 --> 06:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
obviously with what has been happening
 
06:15:51.230 --> 06:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
we do need to explain those things and
 
06:15:54.310 --> 06:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
the reason is you all know um it used to
 
06:15:58.708 --> 06:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
be 50 years ago that many people even if
 
06:16:00.750 --> 06:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
they weren't Farmers themselves they had
 
06:16:03.990 --> 06:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
some experience with their neighbors and
 
06:16:05.910 --> 06:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
they knew some of the these things we
 
06:16:08.868 --> 06:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
have people now people aren't involved
 
06:16:11.708 --> 06:16:11.718 align:start position:0%
in it they don't know these things and
 
06:16:14.468 --> 06:16:14.478 align:start position:0%
that's where the training has to come in
 
06:16:18.110 --> 06:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you uh any qu other
 
06:16:20.270 --> 06:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you for your
 
06:16:24.030 --> 06:16:24.040 align:start position:0%

Lee and and um and you if you have if
 
06:16:39.788 --> 06:16:39.798 align:start position:0%

reasonably well covered please
 
06:16:45.788 --> 06:16:45.798 align:start position:0%
um allude very briefly to them if
 
06:16:47.990 --> 06:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you Mr chairman my name
 
06:16:51.548 --> 06:16:51.558 align:start position:0%
is Eric salel I do live in Lee um I
 
06:16:53.510 --> 06:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
submitted unfortunately it wasn't until
 
06:16:56.070 --> 06:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
this morning because my computer was
 
06:16:58.788 --> 06:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
taking on a life of its own but I did
 
06:17:01.910 --> 06:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
submit um my testimony to all members of
 
06:17:03.030 --> 06:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
the committee and I hope you have a
 
06:17:06.468 --> 06:17:06.478 align:start position:0%
chance to read it I guess would Reserve
 
06:17:10.230 --> 06:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
or wave my testimony and hopefully be
 
06:17:12.030 --> 06:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
able to be part of the discussion
 
06:17:14.390 --> 06:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow in the work session one thing I
 
06:17:16.310 --> 06:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
do want to comment on though is is the
 
06:17:19.110 --> 06:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
chair has just commented about should we
 
06:17:21.030 --> 06:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
have the same wording for
 
06:17:24.150 --> 06:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
livestock uh or other livestock that we
 
06:17:27.948 --> 06:17:27.958 align:start position:0%
have for separating a Colt or a fo from
 
06:17:31.270 --> 06:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
its Dam um you have to think about the
 
06:17:34.948 --> 06:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
dairy industry and if they if that that
 
06:17:37.468 --> 06:17:37.478 align:start position:0%
were the case with the dairy industry
 
06:17:40.830 --> 06:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
there'd be a big uh decrease in the milk
 
06:17:43.948 --> 06:17:43.958 align:start position:0%
Market um so you have to be careful
 
06:17:46.990 --> 06:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
about how you word things of unintended
 
06:17:49.430 --> 06:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
consequences other than that I would I
 
06:17:51.708 --> 06:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
would guess um I'd be happy to answer
 
06:17:53.110 --> 06:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
questions tomorrow if you do have a
 
06:17:55.190 --> 06:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
chance to read my testimony and with
 
06:17:58.350 --> 06:17:58.360 align:start position:0%

Jerry coula I'm a Veterinary and finally

get to meet
 
06:19:06.110 --> 06:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
you I have submitted a very length the
 
06:19:09.590 --> 06:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
um testimony online through the portal
 
06:19:14.070 --> 06:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
so you should have that I came to listen
 
06:19:17.670 --> 06:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
because I um was not involved in any of
 
06:19:20.750 --> 06:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
the case but I do have a special
 
06:19:23.468 --> 06:19:23.478 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the animal cruelty law as
 
06:19:28.150 --> 06:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
it is written right now and
 
06:19:31.708 --> 06:19:31.718 align:start position:0%
um I would like you to make sure that
 
06:19:33.990 --> 06:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
you take a look at the testimony that I
 
06:19:36.628 --> 06:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
sent in because I covered a lot of
 
06:19:38.750 --> 06:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
things and all I did was address the law
 
06:19:41.430 --> 06:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
I did not talk about this particular
 
06:19:43.230 --> 06:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
case that brought it all about to be
 
06:19:45.868 --> 06:19:45.878 align:start position:0%
because I don't know the ins and outs of
 
06:19:49.230 --> 06:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
it so um one of the things I would like
 
06:19:54.270 --> 06:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
to say is um you you're are aware of the
 
06:19:56.788 --> 06:19:56.798 align:start position:0%
two ways that you can seize animals in
 
06:19:59.910 --> 06:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
this state the first one is with a
 
06:20:02.230 --> 06:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
warrant because the we have the Fourth
 
06:20:04.788 --> 06:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights for people and animal
 
06:20:08.830 --> 06:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
are property under the law so nobody can
 
06:20:13.150 --> 06:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
take them without a warrant okay and
 
06:20:16.830 --> 06:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
they are also evidence in a cruelty case
 
06:20:18.510 --> 06:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
now in the warrant there has to be
 
06:20:21.230 --> 06:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
charges there has to be evidence that
 
06:20:24.548 --> 06:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
the law has been broken so something in
 
06:20:27.350 --> 06:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
that list of um essential elements in
 
06:20:30.350 --> 06:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
the law has to have
 
06:20:32.830 --> 06:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
triggered the need for a warrant and
 
06:20:35.190 --> 06:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
that comes with the investigation
 
06:20:37.510 --> 06:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay and the second as you know is the
 
06:20:39.548 --> 06:20:39.558 align:start position:0%
temporary protective custody which does
 
06:20:42.110 --> 06:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
have the Clause that a large a
 
06:20:45.430 --> 06:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
veterinarian licensed in the State uh
 
06:20:48.230 --> 06:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
has to determine probable cause meaning
 
06:20:50.548 --> 06:20:50.558 align:start position:0%
that they have to decide that that
 
06:20:52.910 --> 06:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
animal is in Dire Straits and needs to
 
06:20:55.708 --> 06:20:55.718 align:start position:0%
be taken out of that
 
06:21:00.670 --> 06:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
situation in this state um veterinarians
 
06:21:03.628 --> 06:21:03.638 align:start position:0%
are licensed uh they have to be
 
06:21:05.750 --> 06:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
graduates of a veterinary school which
 
06:21:08.708 --> 06:21:08.718 align:start position:0%
has standards all veterinary schools
 
06:21:10.468 --> 06:21:10.478 align:start position:0%
have the same standards and all
 
06:21:12.750 --> 06:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarians are trained in all species
 
06:21:12.760 --> 06:21:14.030 align:start position:0%
veterinarians are trained in all species
of

06:21:14.030 --> 06:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:21:16.430 --> 06:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
animals they need to be licensed they
 
06:21:19.830 --> 06:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
also need to obtain uh continuing
 
06:21:22.070 --> 06:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
education to maintain that
 
06:21:26.350 --> 06:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
license and um there's no requirement
 
06:21:29.070 --> 06:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
for specialization in the state so that
 
06:21:32.830 --> 06:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
you're not going to see a special um
 
06:21:35.150 --> 06:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
citation on somebody's license that
 
06:21:37.150 --> 06:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
they're only large animal or that
 
06:21:40.430 --> 06:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
they're cat vets or whatever uh and it's
 
06:21:43.948 --> 06:21:43.958 align:start position:0%
up to the veterinarians as as the SPCA
 
06:21:46.948 --> 06:21:46.958 align:start position:0%
has indicated to decide if they feel
 
06:21:49.150 --> 06:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
they're qualified to get involved with
 
06:21:54.190 --> 06:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
the cruelty case Okay um one of the
 
06:21:57.150 --> 06:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
things that was also brought up was the
 
06:21:59.708 --> 06:21:59.718 align:start position:0%
um indemnity clause at the end of the
 
06:22:03.590 --> 06:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
law that is in there right now just for
 
06:22:05.430 --> 06:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
veterinarians that they're absolved from
 
06:22:10.670 --> 06:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
any criminal or um civil um liability
 
06:22:14.310 --> 06:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
with their involvement in a cruelty case
 
06:22:16.230 --> 06:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
um that is there to encourage
 
06:22:18.708 --> 06:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
veterinarians to participate in animal
 
06:22:23.990 --> 06:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
cruelty cases and um to to in lie of
 
06:22:25.628 --> 06:22:25.638 align:start position:0%
making it
 
06:22:28.548 --> 06:22:28.558 align:start position:0%
mandatory um let me see what else came
 
06:22:30.750 --> 06:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
up that I thought I could
 
06:22:33.628 --> 06:22:33.638 align:start position:0%
clarify anyway I've gone through it I'm
 
06:22:35.868 --> 06:22:35.878 align:start position:0%
not going to testify any longer because
 
06:22:38.070 --> 06:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
I've just gone through every part of
 
06:22:40.590 --> 06:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
your law and made comments on the
 
06:22:43.310 --> 06:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
changes as best I could so I would
 
06:22:44.868 --> 06:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if you would at least take
 
06:22:48.270 --> 06:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
a look at that because
 
06:22:52.590 --> 06:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
um I know that in this
 
06:22:54.310 --> 06:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
state the
 
06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
cruelty Law changes are pretty much
 
06:22:59.110 --> 06:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
reactionary they're going to come about
 
06:23:03.510 --> 06:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
as a result of a case we don't do things
 
06:23:03.520 --> 06:23:04.990 align:start position:0%
as a result of a case we don't do things
proactively

06:23:04.990 --> 06:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
proactively
 
06:23:07.430 --> 06:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
like like it would be great to do to sit
 
06:23:09.190 --> 06:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
there and figure out what's going on
 
06:23:13.670 --> 06:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
Statewide and make proactive um
 
06:23:16.670 --> 06:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations in the law and um some
 
06:23:20.750 --> 06:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
of the stuff is good some of it is has
 
06:23:20.760 --> 06:23:22.190 align:start position:0%
of the stuff is good some of it is has
unintentional

06:23:22.190 --> 06:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
unintentional
 
06:23:26.350 --> 06:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
consequences for the whole field of
 
06:23:28.708 --> 06:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty investigation so I just
 
06:23:31.628 --> 06:23:31.638 align:start position:0%
like to that's it for now I'll take
 
06:23:34.430 --> 06:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
questions so I have a question uh which
 
06:23:39.628 --> 06:23:39.638 align:start position:0%
which is um the the uh protective St uh
 
06:23:45.110 --> 06:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
custody statute uh that I um I've been
 
06:23:47.788 --> 06:23:47.798 align:start position:0%
told that that is only applicable if the
 
06:23:50.868 --> 06:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
owner is not present is that clear from
 
06:23:52.510 --> 06:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
the way the statute is written no it is
 
06:23:55.430 --> 06:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
not clear and there are situations
 
06:23:58.110 --> 06:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
when um it might be used when the owner
 
06:24:00.510 --> 06:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
is present okay and what would those
 
06:24:02.868 --> 06:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
situations be those situations would be
 
06:24:05.310 --> 06:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
if there was a complaint
 
06:24:07.750 --> 06:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
and an investigating officer which at
 
06:24:10.868 --> 06:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
this time could be a police officer an
 
06:24:13.868 --> 06:24:13.878 align:start position:0%
animal control officer or an officer of
 
06:24:16.548 --> 06:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
a licensed Humane Society goes to
 
06:24:18.708 --> 06:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
investigate that complaint and they see
 
06:24:21.628 --> 06:24:21.638 align:start position:0%
an animal that is in dire shape and the
 
06:24:24.270 --> 06:24:24.280 align:start position:0%
owner's there and refuses to give it up
 
06:24:28.270 --> 06:24:28.280 align:start position:0%
they can still um take that animal if if
 
06:24:31.830 --> 06:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
they feel that it's exigent
 
06:24:34.590 --> 06:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances sometimes that may be in a
 
06:24:36.190 --> 06:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
household with more than one animal and
 
06:24:38.230 --> 06:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
it might be only one that they're not
 
06:24:41.708 --> 06:24:41.718 align:start position:0%
caring for but there remember that the
 
06:24:44.030 --> 06:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
cruelty law is there to protect the
 
06:24:47.670 --> 06:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
animals it's it's not to protect the
 
06:24:51.230 --> 06:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
people they have their own laws um and
 
06:24:55.110 --> 06:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
it is there the language or the
 
06:24:57.070 --> 06:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
Essential Elements of the law or what
 
06:25:00.270 --> 06:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
constitutes animal cruelty is what our
 
06:25:03.350 --> 06:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
society has decided this is no way to
 
06:25:06.830 --> 06:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
keep an animal so New Hampshire citizens
 
06:25:09.708 --> 06:25:09.718 align:start position:0%
have basically drafted this law with
 
06:25:12.910 --> 06:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
a knowing what's proper and right for
 
06:25:16.270 --> 06:25:16.280 align:start position:0%
the care of animals so
 
06:25:20.708 --> 06:25:20.718 align:start position:0%
um it's unusual to have an owner there
 
06:25:20.718 --> 06:25:21.990 align:start position:0%
um it's unusual to have an owner there
that

06:25:21.990 --> 06:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:25:26.468 --> 06:25:26.478 align:start position:0%
uh would deny care an example and I've
 
06:25:30.070 --> 06:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
actually seen this myself
 
06:25:33.910 --> 06:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
um dogs and hot cars police will come
 
06:25:33.920 --> 06:25:35.310 align:start position:0%
um dogs and hot cars police will come
out

06:25:35.310 --> 06:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:25:37.390 --> 06:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
they'll get the owner back they'll get
 
06:25:38.948 --> 06:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
the animal out of the
 
06:25:42.430 --> 06:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
car and they usually suggest that that
 
06:25:43.830 --> 06:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
owner take the animal to the
 
06:25:45.390 --> 06:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
veterinarian because this can be very
 
06:25:47.390 --> 06:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
critical they can die very quickly they
 
06:25:50.030 --> 06:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
can die after they' come out of the car
 
06:25:52.830 --> 06:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
and sometimes an owner will refuse it's
 
06:25:55.310 --> 06:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
my dog I'll do what I want to do with it
 
06:25:57.548 --> 06:25:57.558 align:start position:0%
the police officer can then take that
 
06:26:00.868 --> 06:26:00.878 align:start position:0%
animal directly to the veterinarian and
 
06:26:03.230 --> 06:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
do what needs to be done and
 
06:26:05.990 --> 06:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
then deal with the owner afterwards and
 
06:26:08.110 --> 06:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
that that would be under the protective
 
06:26:11.270 --> 06:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:14.510 --> 06:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
yeah is the do you believe the statute
 
06:26:16.948 --> 06:26:16.958 align:start position:0%
Ed is as it is currently written makes
 
06:26:20.830 --> 06:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:24.788 --> 06:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
clear I've I've always assumed that it
 
06:26:28.510 --> 06:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
could be um it does not say anything
 
06:26:30.350 --> 06:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
about owner being present so I would
 
06:26:32.788 --> 06:26:32.798 align:start position:0%
assume that it's a a lot of cases are
 
06:26:34.270 --> 06:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
when the owner is not present it's a
 
06:26:37.110 --> 06:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
abandonment um people sometimes the
 
06:26:39.110 --> 06:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
owner has actually passed away in the
 
06:26:41.590 --> 06:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
household or the owner's on vacation and
 
06:26:43.510 --> 06:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
the person was supposed to be taken care
 
06:26:46.110 --> 06:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
of them isn't it's there's a lot of
 
06:26:48.430 --> 06:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
different situations where that could
 
06:26:50.468 --> 06:26:50.478 align:start position:0%
come into play and obviously we can't
 
06:26:52.510 --> 06:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
sit here and think of all of them but to
 
06:26:55.390 --> 06:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
limit it to when the owner is not
 
06:26:58.190 --> 06:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
present might be hamstringing certain
 
06:27:00.468 --> 06:27:00.478 align:start position:0%
cases that come about right okay so I
 
06:27:02.230 --> 06:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
guess my qu the the intent of my
 
06:27:05.270 --> 06:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
question is that do we need to uh
 
06:27:07.910 --> 06:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
address any lack of clarity in that stat
 
06:27:09.070 --> 06:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
you could say whether the owner is
 
06:27:11.270 --> 06:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
present or not in fact I put that in my
 
06:27:14.670 --> 06:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
statement an option thank you are there
 
06:27:14.680 --> 06:27:17.230 align:start position:0%
statement an option thank you are there
other

06:27:17.230 --> 06:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
