introduce House Bill
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
1085 I've handed you a uh piece of
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
information um more than anything else
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's just my goal is to try to make sure
 
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:23.559 align:start position:0%
that you're aware that this situation
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
exists um as I sat in that seat that I
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier um I used to sit and
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
try to figure out how would I game the
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
system if I were um so inclined and this
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
is an area of concern of mine um and
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
I've brought this bill before it has
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
passed the house and then it is uh died
 
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
in the Senate so it's back again but
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
more than anything else I want everyone
 
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
sitting here to understand the
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
information that we've we've worked on
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
and and what we have with the Secretary
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
of State's um assistance and blessing um
 
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
the bill that you have before us by the
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
way the uh Secretary of State and I are
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
working on um actually probably the
 
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary Terry and I are working
 
00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
on some of the language of the questions
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
that are actually asked at the bottom of
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
that um there's some um word smithing
 
00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:28.039 align:start position:0%
that needs to take place there will be
 
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment coming um I think it's at
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
ol as as we speak but um what you have
 
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
in front of you is some work that was
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
done um on the 2016 election and and
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
what we started looking at were absentee
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
ballots that were uh the request for the
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot was mailed to the
 
00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799 align:start position:0%
clerks and with no evidence of of ID and
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
then requested by the clerk to mail it
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
to a different address than the address
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
that um the uh voter was registered at
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
these are only those that were mailed
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire so the um when
 
00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
they requested it we didn't the clerk
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
didn't know who they were um didn't have
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
positive ID is a better way of saying it
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
um and mailed the ballot outside of New
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you'll see from the chart um
 
00:29:35.789 --> 00:29:35.799 align:start position:0%
because we don't know the specific
 
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
address I had asked the Hava people to
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
at least give us how many of those
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
ballots that were mailed from New
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire clerks to Common addresses
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
outside New Hampshire um and what you
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
see before you is is the the work that
 
00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
they did they came back and I'll just
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
pick one two times New Hampshire clerks
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
in total mailed 21 ballots to the same
 
00:30:05.399 --> 00:30:06.590 align:start position:0%
in total mailed 21 ballots to the same
physical

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
physical
 
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
address somewhere outside New Hampshire
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
um the Hava people know what that
 
00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:17.559 align:start position:0%
address is um the secretary of
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
state has the information but can't
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
share it and that's really the purpose
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
of this bill um so that there is a way
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
that we're instructing the Secretary of
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
State to do something either an
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
investigation phase and Andor hand the
 
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
information to the attorney general for
 
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.590 align:start position:0%
information to the attorney general for
further

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
investigation that's what that's the
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
purpose of the
 
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
bill there are many reasons why these
 
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
can be explained um for example it's
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
possible those that two times that the
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Clark's mailed 21 ballots
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
to the same physical address it may be
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
that they went to Brown University or
 
00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
University of Massachusetts and then
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
from their Central mailbox it was sent
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
to a number of different
 
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
people that's that's possible it's also
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
possible that 21 ballots went to one
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
person at University of um uh
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as well we don't know but
 
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
but all of these I think demand some
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
further investigation because it is too
 
00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:38.519 align:start position:0%
easy because these people these ballots
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
that are sent or the requests that are
 
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
sent to the clerks have no positive ID
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
it is very possible for someone to
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
request multiple ballots from um at
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
least three sources that I've thought of
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
um I know know and I'm happy to give you
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
those three sources if if it's of
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
interest um one of them is college
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
students one of them is people that they
 
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:07.240 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
00:32:11.789 --> 00:32:11.799 align:start position:0%
telemarket um my mother was getting
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
phone call after phone call during the
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
election saying do you plan and the
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
first question was do you plan to vote
 
00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
in the next election um they knew she
 
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
was on the checklist but if she said no
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
I don't plan to vote in the next
 
00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:28.350 align:start position:0%
I don't plan to vote in the next
election

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
my belief is that can go in a separate
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
little pile and someone can request her
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
ballot and she would never go to the uh
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
town hall and check to see if somebody
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
had requested her ballot who would um
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
you know you didn't vote why would you
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
go and check to see if somebody used
 
00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:51.799 align:start position:0%
your ballot just never happens
 
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
so my point is this is not investigated
 
00:32:59.549 --> 00:32:59.559 align:start position:0%
this is not not um
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
reviewed mostly because the information
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
is just not available um it's in the
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
database it's just not available without
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
a court order um so I'm trying to say 60
 
00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:16.519 align:start position:0%
days after the election this information
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
should be available um the reason that
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
I've heard in the past why this is not
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
available is that it would be too easy
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
to find out who is not home and then
 
00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:30.919 align:start position:0%
they would be able to have their homes
 
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
burglarized um so I don't really I'm not
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
married to that 60 days you can make it
 
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
180 days you can make it a year I don't
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
care um the point is these should be
 
00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:46.629 align:start position:0%
care um the point is these should be
investigated

00:33:46.629 --> 00:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
investigated
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
where physical address where multiple
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
ballots have gone to a physical address
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
outside New Hampshire and and when it
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
happens I don't
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
care um with that I think I'll end my
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
testimony happy to answer questions I'm
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
sure um things have occurred to other
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
people and and I'm
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
not um I've said this time and time
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
again I'm not a smart guy I figured this
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
out I don't know why um someone that is
 
00:34:23.069 --> 00:34:23.079 align:start position:0%
much smarter um hasn't figured it out
 
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
and taken advantage of how our system is
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
set up so thanks with that I'll be happy
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
to answer questions Mr chairman other
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.470 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
Bay um I think you're a smart guy thank
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um do you have examples
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
of things like this that uh where they
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
were actually taken advantage of the
 
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
system was taken advantage of um thank
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
you for your question um no um I I have
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
no examples um because I don't know who
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you at the time that we
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
got this chart and we discussed it with
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
the Hava people sitting in the archives
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
um there were examples tossed out not
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
with specific addresses but they did
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
point out that one of them and I don't
 
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
know which one one of these addresses
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
happen to be a high rise in Boston in
 
00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
the financial district
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
why would multiple ballots be going to a
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
highrise in in Boston but no one has
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
ever gone to my knowledge the the next
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
step and found and gone and knocked on
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
the door of the high-rise and said why
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
are you know I don't know 14 uh New
 
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ballots coming to your address
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know thank you further questions
 
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
representative PM
 
00:35:59.309 --> 00:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
O'Brien okay that's thank you sir um and
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
I also think you're a smart guy so so
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you some questions
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
could those do you know if that highrise
 
00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
was associated with a a university
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
because if it's a okay no I don't I'm
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
sorry followup follow
 
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
up and also a large military base may
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
same uh no this this did not include any
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
U uaba okay okay all right that's but it
 
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
may be um just if I can elaborate it may
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
also be that uh The Villages or some
 
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
place like that that um has one central
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
location where mail is then distributed
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
within there
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
are I'm I'm conceding the fact that
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
these could be legitimate but no one
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
knows um and the fact that they were
 
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
sent to a common address is a should be
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
a red flag and the fact that um we don't
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
really know who these people are when
 
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
they requested the application for or
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
when they submitted the application for
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
the ballot we don't really know who they
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
are either so th the combination of the
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
two I think is worthy of
 
00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:15.550 align:start position:0%
two I think is worthy of
further

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
viewing representative
 
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
weary thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
um and obviously uh you've not commuted
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
into Boston a lot because it might it
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
that might be a cause for requesting an
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot but um for these Town
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
clerks do we you don't have the physical
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
address that they were mailed to do you
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
have the distribution of which town
 
00:37:45.069 --> 00:37:45.079 align:start position:0%
clerks uh no I don't um I don't know if
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh for instance those 14 were mailed
 
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
from a single town clerk's um location
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
or you know if it were me and I were
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
trying to be
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
sneaky um I would submit the application
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
um to a number of different people in
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
different areas because there's no cross
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
talk for any of that so um I but I have
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
no idea okay thank you thank you
 
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.270 align:start position:0%
no idea okay thank you thank you
representative

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
wood uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering does this imply
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
that um any of these ballots can go out
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
to any address so no one's tracking what
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
addresses um these ballots are going to
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
or that information is collected we just
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
can't get to
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
it um it's almost a distinction without
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
a difference um I I um I have full faith
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
and confidence that the information is
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
that is here is true that the ballots
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
did go to the same address physically I
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
I did not see them
 
00:38:59.470 --> 00:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
perform the actual actual search um I've
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
only seen this result so I guess it's
 
00:39:10.309 --> 00:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
um um I I'm not sure really how to
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
answer the question I I I would say that
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
there is a there is a a doubt um but
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
it's not proof positive in any way shape
 
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
or form that this is something nefarious
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
happening yeah can I follow up yep um
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
fine y yes uh sorry that was a little
 
00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
confusing but how did he get this data I
 
00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
mean do they keep track of this and you
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
you you you got this um I'm just trying
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
to figure out how how you even know this
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
so I first went to the Secretary of
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
State um
 
00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:53.079 align:start position:0%
and you have to um give me a little bit
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
of leway because I this is 2016 and I'm
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
having a hard time figuring out last
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
week so um this uh my my first
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
step that I went to the Secretary of
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
State and and asked him and he said I
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
don't have the information and at that
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
time we had to talk with the Hava people
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
that did have access to the information
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
to do the um the Sorting the uh the
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
request of the of this
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
database um I subsequently I have found
 
00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
out that the Secretary of State really
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
does have access to this but can't share
 
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
it and can't um manipulate it um for the
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
purpose of generating this himself um I
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
think that's true still um but the
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
information does exist of what what that
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
address is um and that's what I would
 
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
suspect when the amendment not suspect
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
but that's the amendment that's coming
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
is going to take this to the next step
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
and have that information that the
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State puts together be able
 
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
to go to the attorney general for
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
further investigation if he feels it
 
00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
warrants that representative
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you for taking my question
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
so uh currently is the SOS sending any
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
potential information over to the
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general if there is any
 
00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.150 align:start position:0%
attorney general if there is any
suspected

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
suspected
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
fraud uh thank you for your question no
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
because they're not there's no reason he
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
has no authority to do that there he
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
can't share that information that's in
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
the database is what I got from the
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State thank you you're
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
Bay thank you Mr chair um please uh let
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
me tell the spirit of my question I
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
actually tried to um get
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
um an absentee B for my daughter who
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
goes to college in another state far
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
away from here and I was told okay
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
either you make uh give this to your
 
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
daughter sign the form send it back to
 
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
us and so forth and I'm imagining when
 
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:09.640 align:start position:0%
they get it they'll check if uh my
 
00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
daughter's in the voting uh list and and
 
00:42:15.309 --> 00:42:15.319 align:start position:0%
send it so I my question is what do you
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
really mean when you say we don't really
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
know who they are okay so let's say that
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
that application is sitting on your um
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
daughter's or this young girl's um desk
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
at college and and someone asks her um
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
are you going oh you going to vote are
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
you going to send that in and she said
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
no I decided I'm going to um vote here
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to register here in whatever
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
state she
 
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
is that application um there's no reason
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
why her roommate or anyone couldn't take
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
that and fill it in with her her
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
name and mail it and have the have the
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
clerk send it anywhere else in the in
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
the well in the country I don't think
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
you could send it in the world but you
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
could send it and and she would never
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
know that she's voted in two
 
00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.270 align:start position:0%
know that she's voted in two
places

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
which if I was a college student would
 
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
worry me if I was on a on a checklist
 
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire but then decided
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
to register and vote somewhere else it
 
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
would worry me that there's the
 
00:43:33.309 --> 00:43:33.319 align:start position:0%
possibility that someone ask for my
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
ballot back here and that's true of any
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
any of their graduates from UNH or
 
00:43:41.309 --> 00:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
anywhere else after they graduate it's
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
very easy to get a list of of who
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
graduated and who was an out of state
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
student they typically leave um New
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and head somewhere else to
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
a job it would be no problem to apply
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
for that um for that uh person's
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot um easily follow up Mr
 
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
follow so uh so this uh procedures right
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
now where when when you make a request
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
you have to uh sign the form right so
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's basically uh in your
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
opinion is really not working so um I
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
believe the and I'm sure the chair can
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
correct me um my understanding was um
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
signatures are not acceptable to be
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
compared so they couldn't compare it to
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
this young girl and say that doesn't
 
00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:37.559 align:start position:0%
look like your signature I don't think
 
00:44:40.109 --> 00:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
it uh signature would be the catch for
 
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
this thank you that is correct the court
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
said that if we are to conduct signature
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
verification we have to provide
 
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
handwriting analysis training so that's
 
00:44:53.309 --> 00:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
not happening uh further questions uh I
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
have one quick question why did you
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
limit it to addresses outside of New
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire why what if there's 50 going
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
to an address in New Hampshire uh it
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
it's entirely possible um at the time we
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
were we were trying to um when I
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned it to the Secretary of State I
 
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
said um what would be a manageable
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
number for them to do since this was
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a fishing Expedition at the time
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
um but he did point out and I think
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere on this um handout that I
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
given you is the is the suggestion that
 
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state was going to go
 
00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:34.559 align:start position:0%
back and ask specifically for common
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
addresses within New Hampshire as well
 
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
um it it there's you're perfectly
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
correct that there this could obviously
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
be happening within New Hampshire um as
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
well as out of New Hampshire okay
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
Hill thank
 
00:45:57.069 --> 00:45:57.079 align:start position:0%
you uh only one of the only one of the
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
pink car in possessions deputy secretary
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
Hennessy and represent in could you
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
sheet good morning everyone Aaron
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hennessy deputy secretary of state I
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
spoke with representative Hill about
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
this bill recently um at the time he
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
collected his data I was sitting next to
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
him in the house of Representatives so I
 
00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
was not involved in his original data
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
collection um but I am happy to take
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
answer uh take questions on this and
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
give you just a little feedback I did
 
00:46:38.109 --> 00:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
request some language changing just to
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
change requests to application um and
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
also um suggest that um once he gets the
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
data what what is it that should be done
 
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
with the data typically when we get
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
requests for this type of information or
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
requirements in law um we have to share
 
00:46:56.549 --> 00:46:56.559 align:start position:0%
with the chair of the house election law
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
committee the senate election law
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
committee the speaker the House of
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
Representatives and the Attorney
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
General's office and then requ and then
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
the law would require them to
 
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
investigate so um some additional
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
language would be needed to um require
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
um the sharing and the investigation
 
00:47:14.829 --> 00:47:14.839 align:start position:0%
piece of it but I believe he's working

listening to representative Hill's
 
00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:06.520 align:start position:0%

00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
where if um if a town clerk were to um
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%

address and knows that 21 people don't
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
live there then we if and she contacted

our off office we would refer her to the
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
AG's office and then they would do some
 
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
investigation but as far as doing data
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
analysis in our office and giving that
 
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:35.800 align:start position:0%

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
half a cup of coffee so you know um I
 
00:49:34.109 --> 00:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
was just curious why the Senate didn't
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
act on it and were you aware did they
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
express their concerns when you took the
 
00:49:41.549 --> 00:49:41.559 align:start position:0%
bill over there uh thank you for the
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
question it's an excellent one um so one
 
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
time um that this was brought up I think
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
it and I'm scratching my memory here
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
without coffee um my understanding was
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
it was one of those it was a year that
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
we uh a number of bills ended up dying
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
on the table
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
um I think it was during the the yeah um
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it was during the shorten
 
00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.030 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it was during the shorten
year

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:50:15.549 --> 00:50:15.559 align:start position:0%
um yeah um correct so that that's my
 
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
recollection um such as it
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
is yeah I don't think it was based on
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
the me on the the merits of the bill
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
yeah there you go yeah I have had I
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
don't I haven't had my CL but I've had
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%

00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
and look at that it's 950 so we'll close
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%

00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
1085 signed up to speak I mean sorry um
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
blue sheet that didn't speak and one on
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
the sheet uh online there were 29 in
 
00:50:57.789 --> 00:50:57.799 align:start position:0%
support 20 opposed and I'm going to
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing uh going to
 
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on House Bill
 
00:51:05.549 --> 00:51:05.559 align:start position:0%
1092 creating a period for the placing
 
00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
of and removal of political advertising
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
on public property going to recognize
 
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
our own representative Howard for the
 
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
purpos of introduction of the Bill thank
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
you so much Mr chair and uh my name is
 
00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
representative Heath Howard I represent
 
00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
the District of straford 4 uh so I have
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
actually passed out an amendment already
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
for this bill uh to kind of allow for
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
two options uh for the committee to
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
consider uh I prefer the amended version
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
myself but essentially uh this would
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
clarify the rules of when we would be
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
allowed to post signage on public
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
property uh so a as we uh know when we
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
sign up to become Representatives we are
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
of course putting our names out into the
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
public and we also have cleanup dates
 
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
for those signs uh a week after the
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
election uh you know unless it's the
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
primary then we have uh another week uh
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh we'll have extended periods if we win
 
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
uh till the general but the thing is is
 
00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
that as we know uh and part of the
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
reason why I've uh gone and submitted
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
this legislation is because the town of
 
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
barington one of the towns that I
 
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
represent uh has requested this language
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh due to the fact that we had a
 
00:52:20.109 --> 00:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
candidate for select board who was
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
posting signage before the November
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
election uh in 2022 uh of course when
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
you're running for a position that is up
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
in March there's a little bit of voter
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
confusion that can happen uh in that
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
type of situation so I've of course was
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
receiving a number of questions about
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
this candidate and if we were going to
 
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
be having Town elections before uh March
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
and of course that was something where
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
it kind of caused a bit of a stir in the
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
community so this would at least kind of
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
clarify when we could put the signage
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
out in the amended version it would be
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
after uh the filing period uh which I
 
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
think is very fair and uh very
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh so with that being said
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
I'm open to any questions are there
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
committee um I actually do have
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
questions because I'm familiar with this
 
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
case that you're referring to um just so
 
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:16.799 align:start position:0%
if if another member wants to jump in on
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
this by the way because I'm just going
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
to kind of run here for a second but if
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
someone want to jump in let me know I
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to monopolize it um so this
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
case this is the guy running for
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
Selectmen he owns a gun store right or
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
something like that um and he's posting
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
a 4x8 if I recall 4 foot by8 foot sign
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
um on his property but it's in the
 
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
public right of way but it is on his
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
property MH right um so you know this I
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
hate I hate I loathe the slippery slope
 
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
argument because it's so you can use it
 
00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
for anything but you know if it's his
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
property and he's posting a sign posting
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
any political sign for me it doesn't
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
matter that he's a candidate he's
 
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
posting any political sign it could say
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
representative Barry is is a jerk
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah don't Vote Barry for governor um
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
how yeah I I I get like you know the
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
roundabouts the or if it's obstructing
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
public view right it's a safety hazard
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
like all of I I get I get true what I
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
would call truly public space and I get
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
safety concerns right but this sign my
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is it's it's back off of
 
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
it's not like on the road um but they
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
just don't like that it's up so early
 
00:54:35.789 --> 00:54:35.799 align:start position:0%
but he does have a First Amendment right
 
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
to express his political opinion even if
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
it's obnoxiously a year before his
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
election how who are we I guess to get
 
00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
to my question who are we to C curtail
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
his first amendment right on property
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
that he does own there's a public right
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
away but he owns that property um so if
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's not creating a safety concern it's
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
not it's his property who are we to tell
 
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
him what he can post specifically about
 
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
political speech on his property yeah so
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I mean I'm I'm fine with
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
whatever he wants to put up on his own
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
private property uh but the thing is is
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
that there were more than just the 4x8
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
there were the uh the uh the corrugated
 
00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:21.039 align:start position:0%
plastic uh signs that you know we buy in
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
bulk and those were all up and down
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
Route 125 and uh and in route n and uh
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
the thing is is that that was kind of
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
the concern that I had was the fact that
 
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
these are all in public spaces on right
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
of ways uh outside of the private
 
00:55:41.029 --> 00:55:41.039 align:start position:0%
property that he owns I understand that
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
there is some discomfort with that sign
 
00:55:47.069 --> 00:55:47.079 align:start position:0%
but uh as long as you know it's again
 
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
following all of the safety guidelines
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
and is posted on private property I I
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
don't have a concern with that the thing
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
is is with and that's why I specify
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
ified public spaces uh on the bill uh so
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
that it would be kind of uh a little bit
 
00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:04.599 align:start position:0%
clearer uh to kind of say if it's not
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
private uh but it's the public property
 
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
the you know uh the the intersections uh
 
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
and roundabouts as you mentioned that
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
would be kind of more concern to me uh
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
and concern to the voters as again they
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
were all over town okay so I'm so so
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
your intention is not the I'm talking
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
about where it's on his right it's on
 
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
the RightWay but it's not obstructing
 
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
and it's his property so we're not
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
talking about that we're talking about
 
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
the roundabouts the town squares right
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about truly public
 
00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:37.559 align:start position:0%
property okay all right so that I'm much
 
00:56:41.069 --> 00:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with um sorry I I
 
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to get I wanted to get that
 
00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
clarified representative Wei yeah thank
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
question is is there a legal definition
 
00:56:53.549 --> 00:56:53.559 align:start position:0%
for public Space versus private
 
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
property um that I am not uh aware of I
 
00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
tried to kind of make it as
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh well not necessarily as broad as
 
00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:07.039 align:start position:0%
possible but uh to specify the fact that
 
00:57:09.029 --> 00:57:09.039 align:start position:0%
we're focusing on public spaces and not
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
private property so I mean I can try and
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
work on something to uh get a better
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
answer for you uh followup yeah yeah I'm
 
00:57:18.839 --> 00:57:20.069 align:start position:0%
answer for you uh followup yeah yeah I'm
just

00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh as it's written could there be
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
someone um you know declaring well I can
 
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
see it it's in public space and even
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
though it might be on private property
 
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
or that sort of thing starting to try to
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
enforce this using that as a mechanism
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
where there's potentially a
 
00:57:45.029 --> 00:57:45.039 align:start position:0%
conflict you know with the private
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
property uh allowances and and
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
so what are your thoughts on on that um
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
well I I I think that in terms of the
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
way that we've uh been kind of trying to
 
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
approach it there is legislative intent
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
and we can kind of make the argument
 
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
that this is intended for specifically
 
00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
public spaces uh as we've already
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
discussed here you know uh right of way
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
public right of ways roundabouts
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
Etc Y where yes
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
followup so uh just you know in in uh
 
00:58:25.029 --> 00:58:25.039 align:start position:0%
Hudson for example if someone if someone
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
were to do this the Public Works would
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
come by if it was on uh you know public
 
00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
property as it were
 
00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
um Public Works would come by they'd
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
sweep them up if the person wanted them
 
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
they'd pick them up at you know the Town
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
Center um uh and you know could repost
 
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
them again if they wanted to and then
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
they would you know get picked up again
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
guess is does bearing not have this
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
capacity to pick these up or is is it
 
00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:01.559 align:start position:0%
just because it was on private property
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
and so they weren't allowed to I'm just
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the well I think
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
they wanted to clarify the rules a bit a
 
00:59:09.309 --> 00:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
little bit because as I had said these
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
signs uh were up and down Route
 
00:59:16.029 --> 00:59:16.039 align:start position:0%
125 uh and Route 9 and uh they were in
 
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
public spaces not on private property
 
00:59:22.589 --> 00:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
and so uh they they were not uh
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily Pi having those picked up
 
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh so they were staying out in public
 
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
spaces which is part of the reason why
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
they requested this
 
00:59:34.029 --> 00:59:34.039 align:start position:0%
legislation further
 
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
questions um yes representative query
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
quae excuse me wow representative quy
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
representative the guy that I beat in my
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
race why we really went into a aware of
 
00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:47.799 align:start position:0%
there yes representative qua and thank
 
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman for that thorough
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
introduction and and thank you
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
representative Howard for taking my
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
question um I'm just reading here
 
00:59:59.710 --> 00:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
66417 and it states
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
explicitly no political advertising
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
shall be placed on or fixed to any
 
01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.190 align:start position:0%
shall be placed on or fixed to any
public

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
property including Highway rights of way
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
or private property without the owner's
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
consent does that suggest at all that
 
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
the means already exist in the law for
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
for say a municipality where someone has
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
posted signage on the municipal property
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
already has the authority to not Grant
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
permission and require it to be removed
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you yeah this this is that part
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
of the statement that's basically saying
 
01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
that we as candidates cannot Place
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
signage wherever we would like on even
 
01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh private rways like if you put it in
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
front of somebody's home without asking
 
01:00:47.029 --> 01:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
them first and without their
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
consent uh followup and wouldn't that
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
imply that municipalities you actually
 
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
own some public proper property for
 
01:00:57.309 --> 01:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
example would would have the authority
 
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
to refuse permission to put a sign of
 
01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
any sort on that property already
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that already have that
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
Authority thank you I I don't know
 
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
because the way the way that I've read
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
that it's it's mostly to kind of give
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
Property Owners uh a little bit further
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
uh uh rights over the land that they are
 
01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:21.079 align:start position:0%
owning is if you're putting out on
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
something that may be public but right
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
in front of their home it may look like
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
they are supporting you uh in your race
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
but they may be supporting a different
 
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
candidate for instance and so this would
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
kind of allow them to uh remove that
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
signage uh legally
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
speaking okay thank you representative
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
taking the question um the law currently
 
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
States political advertising placed on
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
or fixed to any public property may be
 
01:01:58.269 --> 01:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
removed by state city or town
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
maintenance or law enforcement Personnel
 
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
isn't that already in
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
law um well I I think that this is to
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
kind of uh further that statement and
 
01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
kind of because there are certain
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities where towns do take
 
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
liberties with what is allowed and what
 
01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
is acceptable of postage of political
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
signage in public spaces and this would
 
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
kind of create a uh a an area where they
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
could kind of say this is our start
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
period you just can't place it after or
 
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
I mean before this point uh and after
 
01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
people have filed for their election and
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
freely um any other questions
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative Burnham thank you Mr
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
question do you think perhaps it might
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
be a little confusing to have the words
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
public spaces in one portion in the
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
second part public property perhaps if
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's adjusted as public property that
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
might be a little more clear yeah I mean
 
01:03:05.309 --> 01:03:05.319 align:start position:0%
I I would be open to amending that uh
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
further and um we we can definitely work
 
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
on that together um I mean as I stated
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
the reason I wanted to clarify public
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
versus private is that I didn't want to
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
restrict people's ability to uh voice
 
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
their First Amendment right on private
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
property so thank you further questions
 
01:03:25.359 --> 01:03:26.430 align:start position:0%
property so thank you further questions
representative

01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
wood thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question now you're proposing
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
two different versions uh one showing it
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
60 days before the election and one
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
after the filing period yeah so have any
 
01:03:42.029 --> 01:03:42.039 align:start position:0%
comments along the way of where you yeah
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
reset thanks so yeah sorry I I have had
 
01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
a number of conversations with other
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
groups where they cancern they had
 
01:03:52.109 --> 01:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
concerns over the 60-day period uh and I
 
01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
I have to agree with them I prefer the
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
in day version of the bill uh because
 
01:03:59.630 --> 01:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
that makes it very clear that once you
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
are a candidate uh then you can post uh
 
01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
the political signage but if you are not
 
01:04:07.789 --> 01:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily declaring that
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
beforehand uh then it kind of creates a
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
start period I mean we as as I stated we
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
already have a cleanup period uh where
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to clean up these signs
 
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
and this kind of just creates an end gap
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
on the other side where it says I'm
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
starting uh and I can then go and
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
publicly post uh signage in uh in these
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
spaces that are
 
01:04:32.109 --> 01:04:32.119 align:start position:0%
allowed further questions from the Comm
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
Bay thank you Mr chair okay this is
 
01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:39.319 align:start position:0%
probably nitpicky so if I for this one
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
if there's a 10-day filing period a
 
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
candidate can only put a sign after the
 
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
filing period would you
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh welcome an amendment that'll say
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
after the first day of the file fing
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
period or after the the candidate
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
actually filed yeah I I'd be I'd be open
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
to that thank you okay uh further
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
questions seeing n thank you
 
01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative Howard only have one
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
other pink card in my possessions deputy
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
Hennessee good morning everyone Aaron
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
Hennessy deputy secretary of state
 
01:05:23.079 --> 01:05:24.910 align:start position:0%
Hennessy deputy secretary of state
um

01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
the um as the chair of the committee
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
pointed out the political advertising on
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
on private property is free speech um
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
and to representative uh Burnham's point
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
the public spaces as defined in here
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
isn't very well defined
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
um back in I believe the 90s a similar
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
law was in place and I do not know the
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
details behind that but I would
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
recommend reaching out to OS or
 
01:05:57.069 --> 01:05:57.079 align:start position:0%
legislative research to find out why
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
that law was taken off the books um I
 
01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
think based on conversations with other
 
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
people there may have been a lawsuit and
 
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
so they legis the legislature at that
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
time took it off the books um I and
 
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
again I don't know the details but I
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
would recommend just reaching out to
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
legislative research to find out the
 
01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
history of this section um also better
 
01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:22.039 align:start position:0%
defining what public space means does it
 
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
mean that if I have a huge bumper
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
sticker that I keep on my vehicle for a
 
01:06:29.549 --> 01:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
candidate that ran for election eight
 
01:06:32.269 --> 01:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
years ago am I not allowed to park in a
 
01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
public parking spot um does it mean that
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
um I as an individual property owner own
 
01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
the land along the highway that you
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
spoke of and I'm sorry I don't know the
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
instance of that you're speaking of but
 
01:06:50.269 --> 01:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
I own that actual land and the state has
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
a RightWay through that land um and I've
 
01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
given an individual candidate right to
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
post signs all year round on my land
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
even though the state has a right away
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
there are they not allowed to do that um
 
01:07:05.069 --> 01:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
so just some clarification about what
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
public spaces means um and what um
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
anything that would be able to help
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
better Define for our office what what
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
the intent is and also I imagine I can't
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
speak for the AG's office but how to
 
01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:21.710 align:start position:0%
speak for the AG's office but how to
investigate

01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
01:07:24.109 --> 01:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
it will you be taking questions I would
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
love to take questions I might not have
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%

01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
that sounded a little far-fetched truly
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
happened to me in my community many
 
01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
years ago where I was asked to move my
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
vehicle because I had a it was on
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
this is a simple straightforward Bill
 
01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to allow for
 
01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
partisan School District elections House
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 1099 is enabling legislation which
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
means that the legislative body the
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
voters of a school district may choose
 
01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
to adopt the provisions or not and they
 
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
also may choose to resend the provisions
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
once adopted currently there is enabling
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
statute to allow for partisan Town
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
elections under RSA 6691 12 therefore it
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
only makes sense that we would allow for
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
partisan School District
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
elections now allow me to briefly
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
explain the provisions of this bill keep
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
in in mind that the provisions in this
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
bill before you mirror and also
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
reference the provisions for partisan
 
01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.430 align:start position:0%
reference the provisions for partisan
Town

01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
Town
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
elections as I mentioned in RSA
 
01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
669 if this enabling legislation statute
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
is adopted then partisan nominations for
 
01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
school district elections shall be
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
available to any political party which
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
pulled at least 3% of the entire vote
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
cast for the office of governor in the
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
last election
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire that would
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
include two parties Democrat and
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
Republican partisan nominations for
 
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
school district offices are made using a
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
caucus system by a secret ballot and
 
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
then put forward by the Democrat and
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
Republican Town committees in which the
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
school district is
 
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
located with this bill persons wishing
 
01:18:51.629 --> 01:18:51.639 align:start position:0%

01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:54.520 align:start position:0%

01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
ballot option one a person can file
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%

01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
office with the clerk of the Town
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
political committee the town political
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee then meets in caucus to vote
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
and select their party nominees for the
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
various open
 
01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
offices and then the town committee
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
would then notify the school district
 
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
clerk of their part an nominees so these
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
people that went through this process
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
they would be partisan nominees option
 
01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
two a person can alternatively collect
 
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
50 what is called nomination papers for
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
a particular school district office from
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
the voters of their political party
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
within the school district the person
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
would then present the required number
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
of nomination papers to the school
 
01:19:54.629 --> 01:19:54.639 align:start position:0%
district clerk this person then becomes
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
a partisan
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
nominee and then option three is a
 
01:20:01.149 --> 01:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
person who does not wish to seek any
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
partisan affiliation they simply would
 
01:20:07.149 --> 01:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
file with the town clerk or the school
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
district clerk using the same process
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
today this person then becomes an
 
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated nominee so additional
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
details to note with regards to this
 
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
bill the caucuses for selecting partisan
 
01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:24.920 align:start position:0%

01:20:27.629 --> 01:20:27.639 align:start position:0%
sixth Friday before the school district
 
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
election the caucus selection process is
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
outlined in RSA 669 colon 18 and RSA 669
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
col 37- 53 and it speaks to notice
 
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
location checklists ballots hours and
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
the filing certificates of nomination
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
each Town political committee can
 
01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
nominate one candidate for each open
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
Office position in the school district
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
with regards to ballots uh what the
 
01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
ballot will look like it would have
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
three columns listing the candidates for
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
each office Republican Democrat and
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
other and this is similar to the ballot
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
for the partisan state general elections
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
that were all familiar with and um also
 
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
notably The Ordering of the columns and
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
the candidates would be determined
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
annually by a random draw by the
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State lastly they I have an
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
amendment which I passed out to the bill
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
and this um relates to the process for
 
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
partisan scho School District elections
 
01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
when um a co-op is involved I forgot to
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
address that when I drafted this bill in
 
01:21:36.669 --> 01:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
the summer um and then filed the bill in
 
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
September so the amendment simply
 
01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
outlines that political Town Committees
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
of the towns in the co-op they would
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
combine their votes for their partisan
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
nominee for at large positions um like
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
the moderator the clerk or the the the
 
01:21:55.149 --> 01:21:55.159 align:start position:0%

01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
with regards to the enabling statute
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
that we have right now pertaining to
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
town elections I am not aware of any
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
towns based on my research however I am
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
aware of a number of towns that have
 
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
attempted to pass this enabling
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
legislation and they've the constituents
 
01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
have done done so through a petitioned
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
warrant article that being said I am
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
aware of the city of Portsmouth they do
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
have Municipal um partisan Municipal
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
elections for what is called their
 
01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
election officials I did speak to the to
 
01:25:31.629 --> 01:25:31.639 align:start position:0%
the to the clerk of the city of
 
01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:34.639 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and so that they that would
 
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
be an example of a municipality in New
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that does in fact have
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
partisan Municipal
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
elections further questions from the
 
01:25:47.629 --> 01:25:47.639 align:start position:0%
committee representative Brennan thank
 
01:25:50.990 --> 01:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question um
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
we're living in a very very divisive
 
01:25:59.229 --> 01:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
time with um extremes and it
 
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
causes challenges even at the local
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
level and I'm wondering if you have any
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
concerns about this bill contributing to
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
more division at the local level um
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
because you would be taking something
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
that is nonpartisan and serving the
 
01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
entire community and making it into
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
partisan um election do you have any
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
concerns about that thank you for the
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
question representative that's an
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
interesting questions question and um to
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
be clear you know politics whether you
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
know you wear a label or not it it is
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
partisan and you know people based on
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
their their views and what they bring to
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
the table to the elected positions and
 
01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
how they vote it is partis so I don't
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
see this as anything that's going to
 
01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:53.719 align:start position:0%
contribute to what is our already um a
 
01:26:58.750 --> 01:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
reality with regards to um government in
 
01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:01.719 align:start position:0%
our state representative
 
01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
taking another question uh but even
 
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
somebody is a Democrat or Republican
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
they can still sign up as other correct
 
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative that is correct as I
 
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
explained there's three options and
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
three ways to get on the ballot two
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
options you you would be a partisan
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
nominee and the third one is that yes
 
01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
correct you can choose not to to to
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
pursue a partisan um nomination and just
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
sign up as the process is today so that
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
is correct thank you representative
 
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
Lane I I think representative bone
 
01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
addressed my question thank
 
01:27:47.189 --> 01:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
you turn my own mic off representative
 
01:27:49.709 --> 01:27:49.719 align:start position:0%
rafter um yeah thank you Mr chair thanks
 
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um did you say
 
01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
earlier that if you wanted to be an
 
01:27:55.149 --> 01:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
independent you would have to get 50
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
signatures to be on the ballot and is
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
that a bit of a hurdle for people thank
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative so
 
01:28:06.270 --> 01:28:06.280 align:start position:0%
that so I explained an option two if um
 
01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
a person seeking a school district
 
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
office didn't want to go through the
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
caucus um process to become a partisan
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
nominee they could um alternatively get
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's signatures it's called nomination
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
papers of 50 and um to be
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
clear this bill is modeled exactly after
 
01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
the process for me you know partisan
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
Town elections so I'm not doing anything
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
different or above and beyond I feel
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
that it's it's important to keep things
 
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
um consistent across the board thank you
 
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative weie since
 
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
the Comm I am going to end questioning
 
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
for representative power at 10:30 to
 
01:28:50.189 --> 01:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
keep us on time representative we uh
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
just a quick logistical question
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
question if I may thank you Mr chair
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
just a quick logistical question um
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
amend the bill your Amendment says amend
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
the bill after replacing all of section
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
one so this part in the original Bill
 
01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:05.719 align:start position:0%
stays intact and then everything
 
01:29:07.229 --> 01:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
following it would be replaced by the
 
01:29:09.149 --> 01:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
amendment I just want to make sure that
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
is correct yes that's correct okay thank
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
you all right one more question for
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative power um representative
 
01:29:18.430 --> 01:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
Brennan just I I I just want
 
01:29:21.310 --> 01:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
clarification if that's okay um did you
 
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
say that there are zero municipalities
 
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
who that have chosen to enable partisan
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
elections aside from um the city of
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
Portsmith there are zero towns that have
 
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
enabled that thank you for the question
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
representative I have not had much
 
01:29:41.229 --> 01:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
success with the research Department
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
here in um that's availed to us so I did
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
my own research on my own time and I was
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
unable to find any so that doesn't mean
 
01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
that they're not out there but I would
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
emphasize the point that this is
 
01:29:59.109 --> 01:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation it's a tool in our
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
toolbox and if School dist well in this
 
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
case if School District or altern you
 
01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
know if a town would like to um and the
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
voters in that town would like to have
 
01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
this as an option it's there yes okay
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
with that we'll let representative power
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
go um thank you next up will be Eric
 
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:26.930 align:start position:0%
go um thank you next up will be Eric
power

01:30:26.930 --> 01:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.149 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
good morning honorable members of the
 
01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
election law committee my name is Eric
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
power I'm from the town of
 
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
Brookline I'm also the president of an
 
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
organization called the school district
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
governance Association of New Hampshire
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
and also I serve as the Secretary of our
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
Brookline Mason uh Republican
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
committee and I'd like to speak in favor
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill um I think it's an it's an
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
important bill um to allow voters to be
 
01:30:58.510 --> 01:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
able to have a partisan election for the
 
01:31:01.229 --> 01:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
school district like we can for the town
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
um I think it gives the voters more
 
01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:06.280 align:start position:0%
information and um our town committee
 
01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
would be eager to do that you know if
 
01:31:11.109 --> 01:31:11.119 align:start position:0%
you look at the legislation as proposed
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh as the I would be the clerk that
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
would be running the caucus that would
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
help select the school district
 
01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
nominees um this is uh a common sense
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
bill that allows the voters to have more
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
information and also allows the the
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
Committees in the town to be able to be
 
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
more active in the town elections and in
 
01:31:32.189 --> 01:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
this case the school district
 
01:31:35.950 --> 01:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
elections the uh this year we in
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
Brookline we have a worn article to
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
adopt the municipal Town elections we
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
have not put that forth previously so we
 
01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
have that going and we did it by
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
petition and uh as part of that when I
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
was getting signatures and talking to
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
people said why can't we do this for the
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
school district District too we really
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
would like to do that and so logically
 
01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
it said well we can't quite do it yet
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature hasn't permitted it for
 
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
us so there's clearly um a need and a
 
01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:06.280 align:start position:0%
and a want for some folks to have that
 
01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
just to be clear so if you did it in a
 
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
school district you would all your
 
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
school district officials could be
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
nominated and elected on a partisan
 
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
basis the the most common you would
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
think of would be the school board if
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
you had a Cooperative School District it
 
01:32:22.109 --> 01:32:22.119 align:start position:0%
would be your school board and if you
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
had a Cooperative budget committee they
 
01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
would also be under that as well as your
 
01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:26.870 align:start position:0%
would also be under that as well as your
other

01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
officers the um the other thing that may
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
not be clear exactly um you're all state
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
representatives and I know that
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes the Republicans caucus and the
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
democrat's caucus that's available to
 
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
you under 91a because you were elected
 
01:32:44.189 --> 01:32:44.199 align:start position:0%
on a partisan
 
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
basis so if you have a school board that
 
01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
is elected or a Cooperative budget
 
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
committee that's elected on a part basis
 
01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
they could also have a partisan caucus
 
01:32:57.109 --> 01:32:57.119 align:start position:0%
the same way you have a partisan caucus
 
01:32:59.950 --> 01:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
here in the uh in the state house as
 
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats so that's
 
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
another very powerful tool that becomes
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
part of this if you uh if if it's
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
adopted by the school
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
district um I would say that this is
 
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
this is enabling legislation so it's
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
just available if You' like it or not if
 
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
the voters want it they can vote for it
 
01:33:19.109 --> 01:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
if the voters don't want it they don't
 
01:33:20.669 --> 01:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
they can resend it if they don't see it
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
working for them and I think that you
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
know we we live sort of in a world where
 
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
there is politics whether you like to
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
admit it or not and so this just allows
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
the the voters with more information
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
about who they're voting for and I think
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
it it makes a lot of
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
sense so with that I will close thank
 
01:33:41.310 --> 01:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
you will you be taking questions from
 
01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
the committee yes I will all right are
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative PR
 
01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
O'Brien I thank you for taking my
 
01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman do you
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
think this would increase voter
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
participation in those notoriously vot
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
loer low voter turnout elections uh on
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
the school and town level what do you
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
think that's a great question
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
question the I think it will increase
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
voter engagement because they'll see
 
01:34:14.189 --> 01:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
they'll see the partisan piece of it in
 
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
there whether you're an independent or
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
you're a republican you're a Democrat we
 
01:34:20.830 --> 01:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
are I don't know about most towns but in
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
our town we range anywhere from 15 to
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
25% turnout it's often below
 
01:34:30.030 --> 01:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
20% and I think it just would engage
 
01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
more voters there's a lot of apathy out
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
there and this is a tool that was that
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
was the main reason we actually have put
 
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
forth the article for adopting the
 
01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
partisan elections for our town this
 
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
year um I know that there was another
 
01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
attempt at um adopting partisan
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
elections that did not pass that was in
 
01:34:48.669 --> 01:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
Atkinson in
 
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
2022 so there there is a there 's a
 
01:34:54.109 --> 01:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
desire and I think that folks are like
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
well if why can't we have partisan
 
01:34:58.629 --> 01:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
ballots for for the school and the town
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
so I think it would make sense and I
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
think that there might even be more
 
01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
interest in it if you could do it that
 
01:35:06.109 --> 01:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
way and that would increase voter
 
01:35:08.189 --> 01:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
turnout I believe thank
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
Brennan thank you um just going back to
 
01:35:16.109 --> 01:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
your testimony about enabling uh
 
01:35:19.109 --> 01:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
caucusing among school board members so
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
you my school board has five members
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
let's say three of them were Republicans
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
and two of them were Democrats would it
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
not create a situation where you have
 
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
isolated members of the school board uh
 
01:35:36.669 --> 01:35:36.679 align:start position:0%
say if it was 4 to
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
one would it wouldn't it create a
 
01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.350 align:start position:0%
one would it wouldn't it create a
situation

01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:47.159 align:start position:0%
where you are not encouraging working
 
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
together thank you for the question I
 
01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
think it's the same you would ask the
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
same question question does that does
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
being partisan here in this committee
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
offer the
 
01:35:59.470 --> 01:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
same get working together or not I think
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's a valuable tool and I
 
01:36:02.830 --> 01:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
think it you know elections have
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
consequences and who's on the board um
 
01:36:07.870 --> 01:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
makes a difference and who the caucuses
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
are and I think the caucuses are you
 
01:36:11.709 --> 01:36:11.719 align:start position:0%
know the way it works is you take a
 
01:36:14.109 --> 01:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
temporary break and then you come back
 
01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
so I think it it leads it it it helps
 
01:36:19.149 --> 01:36:19.159 align:start position:0%
people work together I think by
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
caucusing together I think that you can
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
arrive at compromises a little bit more
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
because you can in a private caucus I
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
can talk to fellow Republicans and
 
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
decide what's the right way ahead how
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
can we compromise I think it would
 
01:36:32.430 --> 01:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
increase cooperation followup please
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
we're go representative Lane unless she
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
wants to
 
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
yield y rep yes representative
 
01:36:41.709 --> 01:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
Brennan thank you um if this is a way
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
that we were going to this was a road we
 
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
were going to take would you support
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
requiring students to register with a
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
political party as well so that they
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
would would know um that they have
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
representation on their school
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
board I don't see that that's relevant
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
to this question I I I served I didn't
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
mention this but I served as a
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School Board member for
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
three years and I think that if if
 
01:37:11.229 --> 01:37:11.239 align:start position:0%
students are old enough they should go
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
register to vote but I think you know
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
and they they would know who the
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
partisan candidates are if they're if
 
01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.189 align:start position:0%
partisan candidates are if they're if
they're

01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
voting further questions representative
 
01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:21.950 align:start position:0%
voting further questions representative
Lane

01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
Lane
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you U Mr chair I have a similar
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
followup to representative Brennan and
 
01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
what representative bone was talking
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
about to the previous um
 
01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
witness are you aware that over onethird
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
of the voters in New Hampshire are
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
other I I am aware of the statistics
 
01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
about the Republican Party having a
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
slight Edge over the Democrats currently
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and then um um with
 
01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
Independence being the biggest block yes
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
I am so that but there's still a path
 
01:37:59.550 --> 01:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
for people to be independent you know
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
the the ballot would have Republicans
 
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
and Democrats and other so there's this
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
is just enabling if you want to be part
 
01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
of the partisan process you can but
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
you're not forced to further
 
01:38:14.589 --> 01:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bay thank you
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair with regard to um uh partisan
 
01:38:21.790 --> 01:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
elections identifying the parties as um
 
01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
just additional information on the
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
candidates do you know of anything
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
that's uh precluding um candidate in a
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan election uh to identify
 
01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
their party affiliation in their uh
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
materials that they distribute in their
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
campaign thank you representative there
 
01:38:43.229 --> 01:38:43.239 align:start position:0%
is nothing that prohibits it in the
 
01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:45.320 align:start position:0%
campaign materials the signs and such
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
and some do and I did um but uh but
 
01:38:51.629 --> 01:38:51.639 align:start position:0%
having it actually on the ballot
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
this is really um something that voters
 
01:38:56.109 --> 01:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
would like to know because not everybody
 
01:38:58.149 --> 01:38:58.159 align:start position:0%
sees all the advertising that's out
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
there it's always hard to reach voters
 
01:39:02.430 --> 01:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
so like I said more information is
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
better for those who want
 
01:39:09.149 --> 01:39:09.159 align:start position:0%
it okay further questions see um okay
 
01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.159 align:start position:0%
well we're going to we're going to keep
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
things going along we'll have one more
 
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
question then we're going to bring up
 
01:39:14.589 --> 01:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
the next
 
01:39:17.229 --> 01:39:17.239 align:start position:0%
speaker yeah so would would this uh
 
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
my question so would this so say in uh
 
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
town I I from the green party and I
 
01:39:28.109 --> 01:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to register to vote is there any
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
mechanism that would allow me to say
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
that I was from the green party and
 
01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to you know uh participate in the
 
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
ballot in that with that sort of
 
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
affiliation is is it so that even if I
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
was separate from the caucuses I would
 
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
still be able to
 
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
identify if you will my political
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
leanings by that party
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
affiliation thank you for the question
 
01:39:55.629 --> 01:39:55.639 align:start position:0%
under today's law with the with the uh
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
partisan Town elections it's only
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
available to those parties that received
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
3% or more in the previous election for
 
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
governor so if the green party did have
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
3% they could uh have a caucus and they
 
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
could nominate someone but that's the
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
way the law is for uh Municipal Town
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
elections for partisan so that's the
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
same same thing that we're following for
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
the uh School District okay thank you so
 
01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
much uh we're going to let you go
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
um next up is Barrett Christina from the
 
01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire School Board Association

the last pink card that I have R vber if
 
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
you start shipping me the blue sheet
 
01:40:33.629 --> 01:40:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
excellent never mind it's already in my
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
possession thank you thank you chairman
 
01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:41.679 align:start position:0%
Barry thank you members of the committee
 
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is Barrett
 
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
Christina I am the executive director of
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school boards
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
Association we are not taking a position
 
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
on this bill primarily because it's
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
enabling um um and and and when there's
 
01:40:55.229 --> 01:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
enabling bills we often don't take
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
positions with them however I do want to
 
01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
just highlight um a couple issues with
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
the bill and sort of the larger policy
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
issues and perhaps answer a couple
 
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
questions um that that have been asked
 
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
where there may be some some some CL
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
some some confusion or or some answer
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
still may be needed um first of all it
 
01:41:17.709 --> 01:41:17.719 align:start position:0%
it's hard enough to find people to run
 
01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
for local elections these days whether
 
01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
or not a school board um a select board
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh your school district uh clerk your
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
school district moderator NH hsba would
 
01:41:31.629 --> 01:41:31.639 align:start position:0%
have a concern that identifying these as
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
partisan positions would only lessen the
 
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
pool of people who are who are willing
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
and able to run for locally elected
 
01:41:41.950 --> 01:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
office um second of all from a school
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
district perspective um the first aspect
 
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
of good Schoolboard governance is
 
01:41:50.430 --> 01:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
students not party affiliation or or
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
partis in
 
01:41:55.149 --> 01:41:55.159 align:start position:0%
politics um second um I guess somewhat
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
related how would this bill I know this
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
isn't the purview of this committee I
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
understand that but how would this bill
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
help students nhba views everything
 
01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
relative to school districts whether
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's elections or the delivery of
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
services is that how it impacts and how
 
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
it helps
 
01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
students um continuing um a typical
 
01:42:15.149 --> 01:42:15.159 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard member I know we have a
 
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
couple former school board members on on
 
01:42:20.430 --> 01:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
on this committee as it as it as it is
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
um but in my experience your typical
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard parent is is a soccer mom or
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
a soccer dad who's just trying to be be
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
maintain an interest in their child's
 
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
School help out where they can provide
 
01:42:34.990 --> 01:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
the voice of other parents within the
 
01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
district it it's not about being a
 
01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
Republican or a Democrat or an
 
01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
party um in terms of gathering
 
01:42:47.589 --> 01:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
information um about a particular
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
candidate's um positions or views many
 
01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
many candidates will have a Facebook
 
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
page Joe Smith for conquered School
 
01:42:57.390 --> 01:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
Board um many school boards will have
 
01:42:59.430 --> 01:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
you meet the candidates night before
 
01:43:01.589 --> 01:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
March election where they'll come in and
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
and the members of the public may have
 
01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to interview and ask
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
candidates their particular views on
 
01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
school funding or books in the library
 
01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
or the building project or whatever it
 
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
might be um we also have concerns as how
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
this might impact employees um if a
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
school board um is of one particular
 
01:43:24.990 --> 01:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
party or another um and uh through um
 
01:43:27.629 --> 01:43:27.639 align:start position:0%
School through teachers union work um
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
are are teachers going to be targeted
 
01:43:30.669 --> 01:43:30.679 align:start position:0%
for positions that they're taking in
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
their private time that may not be
 
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
popular with the with the with the the
 
01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
majority of of their elected School
 
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
Board um also um we would have concerns
 
01:43:42.270 --> 01:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
that policies and programming would
 
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
swing back and forth every March if our
 
01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
par if our School Board elections um
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
became partisan um you know things like
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh curriculum
 
01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
and and and and textbooks and computer
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
programs those are those are expensive
 
01:43:58.030 --> 01:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
and we don't want one side picking this
 
01:43:59.589 --> 01:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
one election and the other side picking
 
01:44:03.149 --> 01:44:03.159 align:start position:0%
this a following election um to some of
 
01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
the other questions that were raised um
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
I I did not know that this was T that
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
the primary language was lifted from uh
 
01:44:12.669 --> 01:44:12.679 align:start position:0%
similar Provisions in RSA 669 until
 
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative power mentioned that um
 
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
that statute was enacted in
 
01:44:21.149 --> 01:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
1979 um I did do um I I sent a text to
 
01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
my colleagues at the New Hampshire
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and asked if any
 
01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh towns um have implemented the
 
01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
provisions of of um uh RSA 669 col 12
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
the answer was none so 45 years later no
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities have chosen to enact the
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
municipal uh I'm sorry the partisan
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
election system um and relative to that
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
um you
 
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
know speaker before me said that there's
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
there's politics you know in in in our
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
schools whether we like it or not well
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
whether we like it or not shouldn't
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily be um the question um if we
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
don't like it I'm not sure that adding
 
01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
more politics into um our Public School
 
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
uh discussions and decisions is going to
 
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
help alleviate partisanship whether or
 
01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
not that's on the local level the state
 
01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:14.199 align:start position:0%
level or the national level so um I
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
think that's it um uh the other one
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
practical Point um uh we talked about
 
01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:22.639 align:start position:0%
sort of the election the the
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
pre-election system for getting on the
 
01:45:29.149 --> 01:45:29.159 align:start position:0%
ballot um and and currently if go to the
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
town clerk or the school district clerks
 
01:45:33.229 --> 01:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
you fill out a form you pay your $10 and
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
you're on the ballot now we're talking
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
about having a a republican caucus and
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
delegates just just just to get on the
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
ballot it seems like we're inserting a
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
an unnecessarily difficult process um to
 
01:45:48.669 --> 01:45:48.679 align:start position:0%
to to to to achieve what we don't think
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily has a great outcome anyway
 
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
anyway so thank you for your time Mr
 
01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for your time committee
 
01:45:54.990 --> 01:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:46:00.270 --> 01:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
representative P Brian thank you sir uh
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that textbooks and
 
01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
software are expensive and you wouldn't
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
want one person one side picking that
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
but if one side was ending up to pick
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
those things wouldn't it be reflective
 
01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
of the will of the populace of the will
 
01:46:19.149 --> 01:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
of the voters thank you very much
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
question yeah well it it it would
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
certainly be reflective of the will of
 
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
election questions on the committee
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
further questions um I do have one um so
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
these uh Town elections School Board
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
elections the same day um the
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
notoriously low turnout which if you
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
ever follow this committee you know has
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
been a huge um sticking point for me one
 
01:46:48.030 --> 01:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
of the reasons they are low turnout is
 
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
because voters do not know who the
 
01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
candidates are one of the reasons we
 
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
have party preference is because it
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
gives you kind of a boilerplate of who
 
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
that candidate aligns with so wouldn't
 
01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
this bill one of there there's negative
 
01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
effects there's positive effects but
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't one of the positive effects be
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
that we could actually see increased
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
turnout in these elections um because
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
voters would know by default going in
 
01:47:15.070 --> 01:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
which which candidates align with their
 
01:47:16.750 --> 01:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
particular Viewpoint sure thank you very
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
much for the question and that's
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
certainly a reasonable um take on on on
 
01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
why we might want to do this I think
 
01:47:23.950 --> 01:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
there may be other reasons though why
 
01:47:26.589 --> 01:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
voter turn out in local elections is is
 
01:47:29.550 --> 01:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
less than it is when we having election
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
general elections in November when
 
01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
you're when you're voting for your for
 
01:47:35.589 --> 01:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
your your school board there may be one
 
01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
person on the belt or one seat on the
 
01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
Belt when we're going to a general
 
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
election in November there may be
 
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
president Senators House of
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives some State elections so
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
on and so forth so to your point yes I I
 
01:47:49.589 --> 01:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
think that's a valid point but I don't
 
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
know if that's necess neily the entire
 
01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:52.270 align:start position:0%
know if that's necess neily the entire
reason

01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
why as a we'll end here we'll end you
 
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
with there I don't see any other
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
questions I will remark with this your
 
01:47:59.229 --> 01:47:59.239 align:start position:0%
school's taxes are the largest portion
 
01:48:01.229 --> 01:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
of your tax bill so just on a personal
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
level I have trouble accepting that
 
01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
argument I think it's because they don't
 
01:48:05.589 --> 01:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
know who the the candidates are but
 
01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
thank you so much that's my little
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's my little pardon gift to you
 
01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
there's no one else um to speak um so
 
01:48:13.709 --> 01:48:13.719 align:start position:0%
with that we'll close the public hearing
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
um online it was 31 in support uh three
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
oppose zero neutral I'm going to yield
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
the chair uh to represent Vice chairman
 
01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
bill opening up the public hearing on
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1126
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
and we're hear from representative Barry
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
who is the Prime sponsor of the Bill
 
01:48:59.589 --> 01:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um this is a
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up piece of legislation to what
 
01:49:04.990 --> 01:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
we passed I believe it was bipartisan uh
 
01:49:07.149 --> 01:49:07.159 align:start position:0%
last year um this has been one of those
 
01:49:08.669 --> 01:49:08.679 align:start position:0%
things that I've been getting at now I
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
guess for four years now um about making
 
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
these absentee ballot lists more
 
01:49:16.709 --> 01:49:16.719 align:start position:0%
accessible and available to candidates
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
so to give you guys kind of the history
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
here um a bill we passed passed I
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
believe it was I want to say it was the
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
first session of my first so I want to
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
say in 2021 uh we passed a bill that
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
gave candidates the right to have
 
01:49:33.629 --> 01:49:33.639 align:start position:0%
electronic access to the absentee ballot
 
01:49:37.709 --> 01:49:37.719 align:start position:0%
list requests um so in that language it
 
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
said that you as a candidate could
 
01:49:41.589 --> 01:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
basically email your town clerk but
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
saying Hey I want to get the list of
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
people who requested absentee ballots
 
01:49:47.709 --> 01:49:47.719 align:start position:0%
one of the shortcuts we did there was we
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
used existing RSA referencing the um
 
01:49:53.790 --> 01:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
election database the election like
 
01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
portal um and it turns out that there
 
01:49:58.189 --> 01:49:58.199 align:start position:0%
are limitations to what you can get out
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
of that already defined in the statute
 
01:50:02.109 --> 01:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
we referenced uh so specifically the
 
01:50:03.550 --> 01:50:03.560 align:start position:0%
information that you were legally
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
allowed to get was the voter name the
 
01:50:08.910 --> 01:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
voter adid number the date the ABS
 
01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
ballot was requested and the date the
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
ABS ballot was returned um so that's
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
great for people like me who are able to
 
01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
create relational databases and take the
 
01:50:21.149 --> 01:50:21.159 align:start position:0%
voter ID number use it as has a um it's
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
called a reference key and then tag it
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
to the voter file then spit out the
 
01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
address um so if you know how to do that
 
01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
life's great if you don't know how to do
 
01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
that the list is worthless um so what
 
01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
I'm doing here is I'm adding that you
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
get the address where registered so not
 
01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
the address where it's mailed we heard
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
that and I know that that's going to be
 
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
a debate but the address where the
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
voter's registered uh the voter's party
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
affiliation um the type of the election
 
01:50:46.910 --> 01:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
the ballot was cast in and I'll talk
 
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
about that in a second and the date it
 
01:50:50.189 --> 01:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
was mailed so right now you get the date
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
that it was requested and the date it
 
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
was returned but you'll also get the
 
01:50:56.109 --> 01:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
date that the clerk sent it out um the
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
type of the election the ballots cast in
 
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
um most a lot of Voters in these um not
 
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
the odd year elections but the evene
 
01:51:06.189 --> 01:51:06.199 align:start position:0%
elections they request their primary
 
01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
ballot and their um uh general election
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
ballot in in the same in the same poll
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
right they'll send in the form so you
 
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
need to be able to see as a candidate
 
01:51:17.709 --> 01:51:17.719 align:start position:0%
which election you're talking about
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's the primary or the general
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
um but I'm hoping it's pretty
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
non-controversial the information with
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
the exception of the date it was mailed
 
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
the information is already all of this
 
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
can be hobbled together um if you have
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
the right um uh data set skills but um I
 
01:51:35.229 --> 01:51:35.239 align:start position:0%
don't think it should be limited to just
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
those that can create relational
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
databases I think everybody should be
 
01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
able to to use this to communicate with
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
their voters and with that I'm happy to
 
01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:42.550 align:start position:0%
their voters and with that I'm happy to
take

01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:51:45.629 --> 01:51:45.639 align:start position:0%
questions any questions representative
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you Mr chair um why is the
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
both voter ID number needed why is it
 
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
needed yeah um well we already get it um
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
it is a way to identify the individual
 
01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
voter it's the you know everything
 
01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
everything stems from that right um so
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
last names can change right all sort
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
change but your voter number stays the
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
same so it's just a way of tracking
 
01:52:09.310 --> 01:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
tracking people we already get
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
it yeah it's already the voter ID number
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
is already public information as well so
 
01:52:16.069 --> 01:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
it's not that's not like a secret a
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
secret number thank you representa PR
 
01:52:21.149 --> 01:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
Brian thank you
 
01:52:23.229 --> 01:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
is it possible that there could be say
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
two people with the same name and an
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
address and that would clear that sort
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
of thing up you know like a father and
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
son sort of thing correct cuz sometimes
 
01:52:32.109 --> 01:52:32.119 align:start position:0%
the Juniors and the seniors gets left
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
off you really do need the voter ID
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
number um I mean that that you currently
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
get it um but you really do need it to
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh create you know distinction in
 
01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
certain cases I'd say definitely limited
 
01:52:48.589 --> 01:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
cases representative
 
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
warry thank you thank you Mr chair um on
 
01:52:54.189 --> 01:52:54.199 align:start position:0%
the earlier bill that we heard today
 
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
with respect to absente ballots it
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned kind of a 60-day period um so
 
01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
that you know if someone were gone for a
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
period of
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
time uh you know Snowbird or that sort
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
of situation that you wouldn't be making
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
them subject to vandalism or that sort
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
of thing or even though this current
 
01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
regulation doesn't have that would are
 
01:53:20.069 --> 01:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
you amendable to something like that oh
 
01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely not no um so the first thing
 
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
is is this is limited to candidates um
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's not a public access list the
 
01:53:28.109 --> 01:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
candidates already have the rights to it
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
and it is explicitly for the purposes of
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
campaigning so when you put a 60-day
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
delay on it um you make the whole thing
 
01:53:36.669 --> 01:53:36.679 align:start position:0%
I like if you appr that I would I would
 
01:53:38.189 --> 01:53:38.199 align:start position:0%
I would go down swinging on it fighting
 
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
it it's uh candidates have a right to
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
know um yeah I I talked about this all
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
the time candidates have certain rights
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
to candidates have a right to know who
 
01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
their voters are um candidates have a
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
right to campaign to those voters even
 
01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
if those voters sometimes don't want to
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
be campaigned to um you know that's the
 
01:53:55.629 --> 01:53:55.639 align:start position:0%
first amendment stuff but you know if
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
you are voters who are pulling an
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
absente ballot you have a very short
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
window especially in a general election
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
you have a very short window to get to
 
01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
them right right now it's like 45 days
 
01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
so you know you want like I have a very
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
large seat I you're Hudson right Hudson
 
01:54:12.030 --> 01:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
so you have a large seat as well right I
 
01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
think actually we're probably similar um
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
I have 30,000 constituents I think
 
01:54:18.189 --> 01:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
you're right around there right um I
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
can't get to everybody in 4 uh if that's
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
I can't physically get to everybody um
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
in a week it's not possible um I knocked
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
4,500 doors the first time I ran um that
 
01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
would have been you know roughly 20 30%
 
01:54:31.950 --> 01:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
of my voters um and that's a lot and
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's more than some people represent
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
so you you have to when you get these
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
kind of larger Flo terial districts
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
larger towns um and you're starting to
 
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
see you know ABS ballots tend to be
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
around 10% of the request right so it's
 
01:54:47.069 --> 01:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
pretty simple math you know 30,000 times
 
01:54:49.629 --> 01:54:49.639 align:start position:0%
about 70% eligible registration time 10%
 
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
% um you're talking about you know you
 
01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
end up with like in my case you end up
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
with about 800 to 900 ABS ballot
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
requests um once that while the voter
 
01:55:01.069 --> 01:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
does have an ability to go and pull
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
their absentee ballot out on Election
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
Day and that's a whole
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
another box to unpack um the reality is
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
is once a voter has sent in their
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot the likelihood that
 
01:55:14.069 --> 01:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
they're going to make a correction um or
 
01:55:15.470 --> 01:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
a change rather it's probably a better
 
01:55:18.270 --> 01:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
word um is basically slim to none so you
 
01:55:20.109 --> 01:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
really want to get to as a candidate
 
01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
who's in a competitive election you
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
really want to get to that absentee
 
01:55:24.910 --> 01:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
voter as early as possible as quickly as
 
01:55:26.189 --> 01:55:26.199 align:start position:0%
possible because they they've raised
 
01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
their hand and effectively indicated
 
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
that they're voting early um I know that
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
is probably distinction without a
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
difference but they have effectively
 
01:55:34.669 --> 01:55:34.679 align:start position:0%
indicated that they are voting early and
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
you need to get to that voter as soon as
 
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
possible so I'll talk about something
 
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
that I do and I've mentioned this before
 
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
in this committee um is I keep I keep a
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
huge track of who's taking those abs
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
ballots um who's requested one from the
 
01:55:49.550 --> 01:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
general election and I pre-write letter
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
letters and I hand signed them and I
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
hand and I put a stamp on them um and I
 
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
wait and I wait and I wait until that
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
town clerk uh drops the ABS ballots in
 
01:55:58.910 --> 01:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
the mail then I send mine on the same
 
01:56:01.550 --> 01:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
day um so they get it at the same time
 
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
um and I'm very very happy to say that
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
when they were recounting w six there
 
01:56:06.589 --> 01:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
were a lot of ballots that had folds in
 
01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
them that were uh for the opposite party
 
01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
and then um You' see a bunch of them
 
01:56:11.470 --> 01:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
with representative Barry check to the
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
very bottom which is why I won my
 
01:56:17.069 --> 01:56:17.079 align:start position:0%
election so um turns out if you campaign
 
01:56:18.629 --> 01:56:18.639 align:start position:0%
um the voters will vote for you if you
 
01:56:25.950 --> 01:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:28.350 --> 01:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
representa thank you um thank you for
 
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question I am just curious um
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
the voters checklist already has an
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
address in party affiliation how come
 
01:56:36.159 --> 01:56:36.910 align:start position:0%
address in party affiliation how come
the

01:56:36.910 --> 01:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
absentee um voter list doesn't yeah well
 
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
it it didn't because of we um it was a
 
01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
um unintended consequences of how we
 
01:56:50.109 --> 01:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
wrote the law we used um we use
 
01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
basically uh we referenced another piece
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
of RSA that basically said that's the
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
only information you can get out of the
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
election net system so we're basically
 
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
cracking that open and saying you can
 
01:57:03.310 --> 01:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
get um you can get the F you can expand
 
01:57:04.709 --> 01:57:04.719 align:start position:0%
the information you get it's not going
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
to be like a huge burden um they already
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
the information's there um it's not
 
01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be burdening the
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
town clerk with this they already
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
pulling the file you're just adding um 1
 
01:57:20.069 --> 01:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
2 3 four columns to it
 
01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:28.270 --> 01:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
have no more questions I have
 
01:57:31.149 --> 01:57:31.159 align:start position:0%
one one of the problems we have here you
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
have address where registered but in a
 
01:57:36.270 --> 01:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
lot of cases abente ballots corre are
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
going where they're not registered for
 
01:57:43.629 --> 01:57:43.639 align:start position:0%
example in another couple of weeks um a
 
01:57:46.350 --> 01:57:46.360 align:start position:0%
for a resident of litfield is
 
01:57:49.390 --> 01:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
vacationing or summer home in Florida is
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
going to call me up and ask me who to
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
vote for so I mean because he's got an
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot but it's going to
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
Florida so should that be on your list
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
um so I mean personally I would support
 
01:58:02.910 --> 01:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
that I didn't put it on there because I
 
01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
know that there is contention among the
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
committee about that um I tried to make
 
01:58:10.589 --> 01:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
the bill as I I would love to be a 20 on
 
01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
consent and I knew that if it went to
 
01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
address where mailed um that I might
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
lose some people um on a personal level
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
totally down to have that on there so if
 
01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
during Z we all agree that that's cool
 
01:58:23.310 --> 01:58:23.320 align:start position:0%
then I would definitely vote for it um
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
but I try to um when I bring in
 
01:58:28.270 --> 01:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
legislation I I like this I try to be
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
here's where I think we're going to land
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
um even if it's not everything that I
 
01:58:33.550 --> 01:58:33.560 align:start position:0%
want it to
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
be okay sh no more
 
01:58:40.350 --> 01:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
questions oh
 
01:58:42.629 --> 01:58:42.639 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chair just a quick
 
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
question representative on line seven
 
01:58:48.069 --> 01:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
there um it refers to the type of
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
election the ballot was cast in M aren't
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
you trying to get these for campaigning
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
ahead of time you yeah that might be typ
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
we need to fix your tense is wrong yeah
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
cuz I guess you're right yeah the bout
 
01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
hasn't been cashed yet um so I guess
 
01:59:06.109 --> 01:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.030 --> 01:59:10.040 align:start position:0%
maybe we can fix that good catch yeah
 
01:59:11.709 --> 01:59:11.719 align:start position:0%
was request see even I can't do it right
 
01:59:14.069 --> 01:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:59:14.079 --> 01:59:16.310 align:start position:0%
the first
time

01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
okay no more oh represent
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
just a clarification the uh address
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
where a voter is
 
01:59:29.669 --> 01:59:29.679 align:start position:0%
registered in the case that my friend
 
01:59:34.069 --> 01:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
chairman B referenced uh where someone
 
01:59:36.750 --> 01:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
is spending a great deal of time in
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
Florida say or as a snowbird would they
 
01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
not have their mail where they're
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
registered be forwarded to that other
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
Home in Florida and wouldn't that
 
01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
resolve the issue that
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
it might and I'm definitely down to have
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
that debate and conversation um it might
 
01:59:55.109 --> 01:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
it could just be that they're away on
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
vacation in Aruba um thank you you know
 
02:00:00.589 --> 02:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a com
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
the there's there's information that is
 
02:00:04.069 --> 02:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
inherently excluded right we don't get
 
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
protected voters right um you know
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
personally on a very personal level I
 
02:00:09.870 --> 02:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
think you have a right to know where the
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
ballot went um I I just think you do and
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
it's not just a campaign perspective
 
02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
it's I think as a voter and a candidate
 
02:00:17.069 --> 02:00:17.079 align:start position:0%
you have a right to know where your
 
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
ballots are going um but I know not
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
everybody in the committee holds that
 
02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
worldview and I I didn't want to um
 
02:00:24.510 --> 02:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
sounds like we have another vehicle in
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
which we can explore that uh
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
conversation I just don't want it to be
 
02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:29.750 align:start position:0%
conversation I just don't want it to be
this

02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:31.669 align:start position:0%
this
one

02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:00:33.709 --> 02:00:33.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
you represent Barry next on the list is
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:47.470 --> 02:00:47.480 align:start position:0%
henesy good morning everyone Aaron
 
02:00:49.629 --> 02:00:49.639 align:start position:0%
Hennessy Deputy sake good to see
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
everybody again
 
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
um this um language in the bill would be
 
02:00:57.229 --> 02:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
something that our office could do um
 
02:00:59.629 --> 02:00:59.639 align:start position:0%
easily with um creating new reports
 
02:01:01.629 --> 02:01:01.639 align:start position:0%
within our Statewide voter registration
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
system um to the Chairman's um testimony
 
02:01:08.350 --> 02:01:08.360 align:start position:0%
this um the reports would be generated
 
02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
by our office templates for them and
 
02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
then your local Clerk or if requested on
 
02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
a Statewide level our office would um
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
generate that report through that
 
02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
template so that no um inappropriate
 
02:01:22.310 --> 02:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
information would be given out um so
 
02:01:24.030 --> 02:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
it's something that can be done um very
 
02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
similar to what is done now uh to
 
02:01:28.069 --> 02:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
representative Wards point we would
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
request some language clarification in
 
02:01:33.709 --> 02:01:33.719 align:start position:0%
in the bill um um in two different
 
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
places one is the um type of election
 
02:01:39.790 --> 02:01:39.800 align:start position:0%
the ballot was cast in I would recommend
 
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
that that would be changed to um
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
election the ballot was requested for um
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
additionally um the date mailed not all
 
02:01:52.830 --> 02:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
um absentee ballots are mailed um
 
02:01:54.189 --> 02:01:54.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're hand delivered for
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
example in January when I went in to get
 
02:02:01.229 --> 02:02:01.239 align:start position:0%
my um pay my car tax um and my daughter
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
was registering to vote my clerk asked
 
02:02:05.149 --> 02:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
if I would like my absentee ballot which
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
I had already requested and she hand
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
delivered it to me um so maybe just
 
02:02:13.350 --> 02:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
semantics around um our system will not
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
be able to tell you if it was hand
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
delivered or mailed so just um sent or
 
02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
another word versus mailed um that would
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
make sense to you and and um solve any
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
um questions about if we need to make a
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
a change in our system or not I'm happy
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
02:02:35.709 --> 02:02:35.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:39.030 --> 02:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
questions no representative warry ju uh
 
02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:40.149 align:start position:0%
questions no representative warry ju uh
just

02:02:40.149 --> 02:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:02:44.109 --> 02:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
to um on the possibility that we might
 
02:02:47.470 --> 02:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
reach a consensus on where where it was
 
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
mailed to if if we were to go for that
 
02:02:53.629 --> 02:02:53.639 align:start position:0%
piece of data as well would that be
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
readily available or possible through
 
02:02:59.069 --> 02:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
this mechanism if you were to put in
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
this bill that we would be required to
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
also provide the address to which it was
 
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
mailed our system would have that and
 
02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:13.030 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay with that thank you and no more
 
02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
people on the list the blue sheet was
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.589 --> 02:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
at who looked it up um who signed in
 
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
electronically so with that I close the
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
02:03:37.950 --> 02:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
11:26 and turn the gavel back over to
 
02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:40.109 align:start position:0%
11:26 and turn the gavel back over to
the

02:03:40.109 --> 02:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
chair okay o

11:05 Cas somebody should asked another
[Laughter]

02:04:06.990 --> 02:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
question uh I don't have 11 I don't have
 
02:04:12.549 --> 02:04:12.559 align:start position:0%

[Laughter]
[Music]

02:04:40.629 --> 02:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.760 --> 02:05:05.350 align:start position:0%
 
morning

02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:14.229 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.239 --> 02:05:16.310 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
bille okay 11:05 going to reopen the
 
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
Public House election law committee for
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
the purpos of public hearing on house
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
1134 relative to inventory controls of
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
paper ballots we'll recognize our own
 
02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative bham for the purpose of
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill representative
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
burnhams good to see
 
02:06:00.910 --> 02:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:06:03.069 --> 02:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me to introduce
 
02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
this bill um so essentially this is just
 
02:06:08.430 --> 02:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
to uh have
 
02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
accountability from the Inception of the
 
02:06:15.149 --> 02:06:15.159 align:start position:0%
ballot um until uh they are uh finally
 
02:06:20.109 --> 02:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
reconciled and um put away uh um for
 
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
such a time if necessary uh this will
 
02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:27.229 align:start position:0%
such a time if necessary uh this will
help

02:06:27.229 --> 02:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
um local elections and also
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
um should there be any question as to
 
02:06:38.589 --> 02:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
the uh amount of ballots um that are
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
generated and provided by our printer
 
02:06:46.030 --> 02:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
all the way to um election day as to how
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
many are received from the local town
 
02:06:52.750 --> 02:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
level and um as well as the absentee
 
02:06:56.350 --> 02:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
ballots that are also in that um same
 
02:06:58.830 --> 02:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
process so it just kind of
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
clarifies some of the issues that tend
 
02:07:03.709 --> 02:07:03.719 align:start position:0%
to happen at the end of the evening of
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
Elections with the moderator checklist
 
02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
certificate so hopefully all the numbers
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
balance out and there aren't any backing
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
up issues that tend to happen that
 
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
evening to get the proper numbers so
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's all I have all
 
02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlet thank you Mr
 
02:07:27.109 --> 02:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:07:31.629 --> 02:07:31.639 align:start position:0%
question sure um so we I just want to
 
02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
have a clarification about what this is
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
asking for we we
 
02:07:39.149 --> 02:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
already uh keep count of how many blank
 
02:07:42.189 --> 02:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
ballots you know we that are given to
 
02:07:44.189 --> 02:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
the polling place and how many blank
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
ballots are given out to voters and then
 
02:07:49.149 --> 02:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
how many
 
02:07:51.709 --> 02:07:51.719 align:start position:0%
uh of those ballots are how many blank
 
02:07:53.669 --> 02:07:53.679 align:start position:0%
ballots are left over at the end so
 
02:07:53.679 --> 02:07:54.510 align:start position:0%
ballots are left over at the end so
there's

02:07:54.510 --> 02:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
already a a very
 
02:08:04.149 --> 02:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:08.069 --> 02:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
ballots okay so uh what
 
02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
um what else is this asking
 
02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
for this is actually at the beginning
 
02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
phase of the ballots that's not included
 
02:08:22.030 --> 02:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
such as the order requested from the
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
printer yep I don't see anybody else
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
those absolutely thank you um so so how
 
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
does that help uh how how does uh how
 
02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
does that help you know verify the
 
02:08:35.629 --> 02:08:35.639 align:start position:0%
number of people that actually
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
voted it's actually tracking the actual
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
ballot itself not so much how many just
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
voted but also how many have been
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
ordered and printed prior to receiving
 
02:08:48.510 --> 02:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
in the town it kind of adds that
 
02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:50.589 align:start position:0%
in the town it kind of adds that
beginning

02:08:50.589 --> 02:08:50.599 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
02:08:52.750 --> 02:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
State yeah keep keep going if any one
 
02:08:56.549 --> 02:08:56.559 align:start position:0%
else wants to jump in on sure okay so I
 
02:08:59.069 --> 02:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
I well I guess I don't want to debate it
 
02:09:02.069 --> 02:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
I just don't understand why that helps
 
02:09:05.950 --> 02:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
with the accuracy of the the votes um
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
think that matter I'm sorry I think that
 
02:09:10.470 --> 02:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative weary has some
 
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
information to share on
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
that so he can go into more detail he is
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
up next thank you
 
02:09:20.589 --> 02:09:20.599 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
Burnham and representative wey is up
 
02:09:37.069 --> 02:09:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chair and honorable
 
02:09:41.310 --> 02:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record my name
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
is Robert worry I have the privilege of
 
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
serving in Hillsboro County's 13th
 
02:09:48.990 --> 02:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
District the great town of Hudson
 
02:09:53.189 --> 02:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
um just want to give a little preamble
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
to um why this uh particular bill was
 
02:10:03.189 --> 02:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
put forward um so in December 2022 the
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
report of special committee on voter
 
02:10:06.549 --> 02:10:06.559 align:start position:0%
confidence stated that one of the
 
02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
reasons for high public confidence in
 
02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
the Safety and Security of New Hampshire
 
02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
elections is because quote each voter
 
02:10:14.350 --> 02:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
has a paper
 
02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
ballot so a proper inventory of printed
 
02:10:17.679 --> 02:10:18.870 align:start position:0%
ballot so a proper inventory of printed
ballots

02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
02:10:21.149 --> 02:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
starting at the printer enables the
 
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
reconciliation of ballots throughout the
 
02:10:25.390 --> 02:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
election life cycle to be able to fully
 
02:10:27.470 --> 02:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrate accountability of every
 
02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
paper ballot not just kind of what's
 
02:10:33.669 --> 02:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
locally in the town but but also what's
 
02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
produced at the printing
 
02:10:39.189 --> 02:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
shop um an ability to fully reconcile
 
02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
ballots um or an inability to fully
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
reconcile all the printed ballots
 
02:10:46.510 --> 02:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
creates an uncertainty and may cast out
 
02:10:48.270 --> 02:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
on the full security of the paper ballot
 
02:10:52.270 --> 02:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
so to maintain that confidence in the
 
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
election um there are certainly some
 
02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
areas that don't have uh if you will
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
full accountability yet at least not in
 
02:11:04.350 --> 02:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
a recorded fashion and so the idea
 
02:11:06.910 --> 02:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
behind this bill is simply to do that in
 
02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
I I would say from more of a personal
 
02:11:11.149 --> 02:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
experience I'm used to dealing with um
 
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
highly regulated drugs which have a
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
certain labeling um that are required
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
for them and and you're really required
 
02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
to have a um amount of labels purchased
 
02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
um and then amount of labels shipped
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
amount of label used M labels disposed
 
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know very similar to what we do with
 
02:11:33.709 --> 02:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
election ballots but it begins with
 
02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
what's done at the printer and this is
 
02:11:39.069 --> 02:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
really to kind of get more granular
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
about those sorts of bits of information
 
02:11:45.229 --> 02:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
and so that really there's a full
 
02:11:47.709 --> 02:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
accountability of of that from beginning
 
02:11:49.470 --> 02:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
to end
 
02:11:51.629 --> 02:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
and with that I will take any questions
 
02:11:54.350 --> 02:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
if you wish questions from the committee
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
resent of H do you have a
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
question I said I had a feeling that you
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
would I could just thank you psychic
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
question um I don't think com comparing
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
the inventory of ballot is a good
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
comparison to the comparing the
 
02:12:15.790 --> 02:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
inventory of
 
02:12:19.870 --> 02:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
prescriptions um can you it's not it's
 
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
not prescription it's a it's a label for
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
the drugs where that is actually tightly
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
controlled by the Food and Drug
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
Administration for their regulations so
 
02:12:33.069 --> 02:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
it it's it's the it's the tight control
 
02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
inventory and Reconciliation of of
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical labeling and and that is
 
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
um and the analogy is perhaps that
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
there's there's a great problem with
 
02:12:47.790 --> 02:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
counterfeiting in the pharmaceutical
 
02:12:49.629 --> 02:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
industry industry and that that is
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
analogous to um concerns that at least
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
some parties have expressed with regard
 
02:12:59.830 --> 02:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
to ballots and whatnot so um and misuse
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
of ballots and this would simply end
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.510 --> 02:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
frankly further questions from the
 
02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%

scandin Dave David SC do we go David I
don't

02:13:20.589 --> 02:13:20.599 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
know either one is fine Mr
 
02:13:28.030 --> 02:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for the record I'm
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State David scanlin and I
 
02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to take the opportunity to just
 
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
inform the committee how the ballot
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
production process works um I understand
 
02:13:40.549 --> 02:13:40.559 align:start position:0%
the concerns that are out there about
 
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
inventory and you know making sure that
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
we account for
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
everything uh the concern I have is that
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
we can take a to a level that actually
 
02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
makes us more efficient and and causes
 
02:13:55.069 --> 02:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
problems with the election process
 
02:13:56.990 --> 02:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
because we're we're dealing with really
 
02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
tight time frames as we get in excuse me
 
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
close proximity to the election so
 
02:14:05.790 --> 02:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully when I explain the process it
 
02:14:08.109 --> 02:14:08.119 align:start position:0%
will alleviate some of the fears and
 
02:14:10.310 --> 02:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
concerns that are out there about how
 
02:14:12.549 --> 02:14:12.559 align:start position:0%
this process works and I know that we
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
have some local election officials in
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
the room so you know I think you already
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
have a you know have some understanding
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:14:22.669 --> 02:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
but when it comes time for an election
 
02:14:24.669 --> 02:14:24.679 align:start position:0%
the first thing uh that I do as
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is try to determine
 
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
how many voters I think are going to
 
02:14:31.549 --> 02:14:31.559 align:start position:0%
turn out at the polls on the day of the
 
02:14:35.709 --> 02:14:35.719 align:start position:0%
election and based on that I will
 
02:14:38.990 --> 02:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
determine how many ballots both absentee
 
02:14:41.629 --> 02:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
and official uh that we need to have
 
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
printed for every polling place uh in
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
02:14:50.109 --> 02:14:50.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then based on that uh and
 
02:14:53.109 --> 02:14:53.119 align:start position:0%
based on the filings you we have we have
 
02:14:56.549 --> 02:14:56.559 align:start position:0%
staff that that design the ballot
 
02:14:58.709 --> 02:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
according to the requirements in the
 
02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
statute it takes a tremendous amount of
 
02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
time to actually proof those ballots and
 
02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're completely
 
02:15:09.870 --> 02:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
accurate and even at that even after we
 
02:15:12.669 --> 02:15:12.679 align:start position:0%
go to print sometimes somebody will find
 
02:15:15.629 --> 02:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
you know a spelling error or something
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh and I'll talk about how we deal with
 
02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
that in a second second but the first
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
thing I do is I come up with a number of
 
02:15:25.549 --> 02:15:25.559 align:start position:0%
ballots that need to be printed and that
 
02:15:27.790 --> 02:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
number is delivered to the
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
printer um we have a uh a relationship
 
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
with a local printer that does that
 
02:15:38.910 --> 02:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
prints the ballots for us um when they
 
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
are doing that we have a presence at the
 
02:15:44.109 --> 02:15:44.119 align:start position:0%
Press with staff in my office so that
 
02:15:46.990 --> 02:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
they are are there uh kind of overseeing
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
that process
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
the ballots are organized by
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
numbers and we have these big big sheets
 
02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
of paper that we order from the pul mill
 
02:16:03.910 --> 02:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
and the the people at the Press will
 
02:16:06.990 --> 02:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
organize might be four or six or eight
 
02:16:10.189 --> 02:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
ballots per sheet of paper for the
 
02:16:14.910 --> 02:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
different towns and uh they run that you
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
know they they they do that run uh based
 
02:16:21.069 --> 02:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
on the numbers that I gave
 
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
them they excuse me they produced their
 
02:16:28.390 --> 02:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
own sheet that tells how many ballots
 
02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
they actually
 
02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
printed and then when those uh when the
 
02:16:36.589 --> 02:16:36.599 align:start position:0%
sheets are printed they go to a cutter
 
02:16:38.790 --> 02:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
and the cutter then Cuts all trims all
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
the excess paper off so that we're left
 
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
with just the
 
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
ballots the the towns on an individual
 
02:16:49.230 --> 02:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
large sheet of paper May vary
 
02:16:52.629 --> 02:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
somewhat excuse me in
 
02:16:56.349 --> 02:16:56.359 align:start position:0%
size um and so for you know for one town
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
we might order 3,000 ballots for another
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
town it might be 3500 another town it
 
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
might be
 
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
3250 but in the end the uh the printer
 
02:17:12.309 --> 02:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
will take the number of ballots that we
 
02:17:15.669 --> 02:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
ordered from that stack and give them to
 
02:17:18.190 --> 02:17:18.200 align:start position:0%
the staff that we have in the press that
 
02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
are actually boxing the ballots up and
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
shipping them to the individual polling
 
02:17:27.750 --> 02:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
places the leftover ballots um the
 
02:17:30.910 --> 02:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
excess ballots I'll say are kept at the
 
02:17:34.509 --> 02:17:34.519 align:start position:0%
press and we call those overrun ballots
 
02:17:37.469 --> 02:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
so that if there is a town that feels
 
02:17:38.910 --> 02:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
like they're getting nervous because
 
02:17:40.230 --> 02:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
they feel like they're running low on
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
ballots they call us up what do we do we
 
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
usually have those overrun ballots that
 
02:17:48.629 --> 02:17:48.639 align:start position:0%
we can put in a box and get to them
 
02:17:51.950 --> 02:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
right away but each step of the way when
 
02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
I order the ballots we keep track of
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
that when the printer prints them we
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
keep track of that so we know how many
 
02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
ballots was actually printed versus the
 
02:18:06.429 --> 02:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
order and we have an idea of the number
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
of overruns that we have at the
 
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
Press because we're dealing with so many
 
02:18:13.950 --> 02:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
sheets of paper in a general election
 
02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's well over a million ballots
 
02:18:18.270 --> 02:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
that we print
 
02:18:19.669 --> 02:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh we don't sit there we don't have
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
somebody actually counting each stack
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
they have these uh tools that they call
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
stab counters that you know will you
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
kind of push it into the pile and it'll
 
02:18:33.629 --> 02:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
pull out the set amount it's not perfect
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's usually within one or two uh either
 
02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:37.990 align:start position:0%
it's usually within one or two uh either
way

02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:18:41.709 --> 02:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
so uh we tell the moderator we tell the
 
02:18:44.190 --> 02:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
town how many ballots are in the box
 
02:18:45.309 --> 02:18:45.319 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
receiving but then there's a law that
 
02:18:49.870 --> 02:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
requ requires the moderator to actually
 
02:18:52.629 --> 02:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
physically count those ballots once they
 
02:18:54.990 --> 02:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
get them so they have the exact number
 
02:18:57.469 --> 02:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
of ballots that they actually received
 
02:19:00.669 --> 02:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:00.679 --> 02:19:02.469 align:start position:0%
 
State

02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
State
 
02:19:05.830 --> 02:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
if a town receives overrun ballots
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
because they got low we keep track of
 
02:19:09.429 --> 02:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
that we keep track of how many ballots
 
02:19:11.589 --> 02:19:11.599 align:start position:0%
we sent to them sometimes we have a
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
candidate that will pass away and if
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
there is enough time between that event
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
and the ction and the party gives us the
 
02:19:22.589 --> 02:19:22.599 align:start position:0%
name of a replacement we will reprint
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
the whole set of ballots for that town
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
we keep track of that um some I
 
02:19:31.150 --> 02:19:31.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned sometimes we find a mistake
 
02:19:32.709 --> 02:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
you know candidate's name is spelled
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
wrong or something we will reprint the
 
02:19:37.750 --> 02:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
ballots and keep track of that but you
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
know there is a you know we we keep
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
track of those numbers so then we get to
 
02:19:45.709 --> 02:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
the election day um and these are the
 
02:19:48.429 --> 02:19:48.439 align:start position:0%
numbers that are really important it is
 
02:19:50.349 --> 02:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
the number of ballots that were actually
 
02:19:52.510 --> 02:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
cast how many ballots went through the
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
machine and how many were handc counted
 
02:19:58.270 --> 02:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
combined uh or if it's a hand countown
 
02:20:00.270 --> 02:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
how many you know ballots came out of
 
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
the box and they were counted and then
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
comparing that number with the number of
 
02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
Voters that checked in on the day of the
 
02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
election and hopefully they match um
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's more ballots than
 
02:20:15.710 --> 02:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
voters checked in and that's usually
 
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
because the ballot cler got to
 
02:20:19.510 --> 02:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
socializing a little bit too much and
 
02:20:22.150 --> 02:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
somebody forgot to cross a name off the
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
checklist so you know if there's a a two
 
02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
or three vote variation there we don't
 
02:20:30.030 --> 02:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
get too excited about that um if it's
 
02:20:32.429 --> 02:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
much larger then uh we have to figure
 
02:20:32.439 --> 02:20:33.990 align:start position:0%
much larger then uh we have to figure
out

02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
why when we do our training with local
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
election officials we we uh give them
 
02:20:44.150 --> 02:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
different ways that they can reconcile
 
02:20:45.790 --> 02:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
the numbers that they have at the end of
 
02:20:48.469 --> 02:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
the night and you know it might be
 
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
finding a couple of the major candidates
 
02:20:52.830 --> 02:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
on the ballot getting their totals
 
02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
adding in the undervotes and the and the
 
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
overvotes in a particular race you know
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:05.349 --> 02:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
closely it it is not unusual because
 
02:21:07.230 --> 02:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
this is not a perfect system that you
 
02:21:09.190 --> 02:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
know there is minor variations in those
 
02:21:12.070 --> 02:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
numbers and uh that's why you see the
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
election officials get really excited if
 
02:21:17.910 --> 02:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
everything matches exactly um and
 
02:21:19.750 --> 02:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes they just don't you know some
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's it's late at night and
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're tired and the numbers
 
02:21:27.790 --> 02:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
are off and they just can't figure it
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
out um they send us the report as it is
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
and then we try and sit down with them
 
02:21:36.469 --> 02:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
after the election you know to help them
 
02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
reconcile uh as best we can those
 
02:21:43.950 --> 02:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
numbers when the election is over all of
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
the cast ballots are stored in sealed by
 
02:21:51.670 --> 02:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
boxes and all of the uncast ballots that
 
02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
were sent to the polling place are
 
02:21:57.790 --> 02:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
stored in sealed boxes there is no
 
02:22:00.190 --> 02:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
requirement at a recount that you know
 
02:22:03.309 --> 02:22:03.319 align:start position:0%
the the uncast ballots have to be
 
02:22:06.670 --> 02:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
counted up uh the law just says that the
 
02:22:10.349 --> 02:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
cast ballots are counted uh at a recount
 
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
and so that is what we do but we have
 
02:22:17.469 --> 02:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
all of the physical evidence if we had
 
02:22:20.910 --> 02:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
to you know reconcile a you know the
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
number of ballots that were uh printed
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
and used at an election for an election
 
02:22:30.750 --> 02:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
with in reason uh are there and those
 
02:22:33.190 --> 02:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
summary numbers that I mentioned to you
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
we do keep track of and they're
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
available you know upon request for um
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
anyone that's
 
02:22:44.230 --> 02:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
interested and then the last thing that

very helpful can you talk about how
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
spoiled ballots are accounted
 
02:23:30.990 --> 02:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
for a so if a voter uh makes a mistake
 
02:23:33.269 --> 02:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
on their ballot they go to the moderator
 
02:23:35.830 --> 02:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh and ask for a new one the moderator
 
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
will write spoiled on uh the back of the
 
02:23:41.469 --> 02:23:41.479 align:start position:0%
ballot and initial it and then keep
 
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
those uh ballots so that they are they
 
02:23:48.389 --> 02:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
are uh
 
02:23:52.269 --> 02:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
kept and maintain along with the all the
 
02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
other ballot materials from that
 
02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
election uh sealed in a box and when we
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
conduct a recount boxes open up the
 
02:24:03.269 --> 02:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
spoiled ballots are there so that you
 
02:24:04.590 --> 02:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
know people can see that there were
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
ballots of that
 
02:24:09.190 --> 02:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
nature follow up ribs and Bone you want
 
02:24:13.269 --> 02:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
to yield yep if I understand your
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
testimony correctly it sounds like you
 
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
are s satisfied with the inventory
 
02:24:21.550 --> 02:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
controls for accountability of paper
 
02:24:23.429 --> 02:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
ballots am I understanding your
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
testimony correctly I'm satisfied yes my
 
02:24:29.309 --> 02:24:29.319 align:start position:0%
my job is to help you understand that so
 
02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
you're satisfied and that's the that's
 
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
the goal here and we need to do that to
 
02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
instill confidence in our elections it's
 
02:24:40.030 --> 02:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
not what I believe it's what everybody
 
02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
else believes it's involved in this
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
process thank you Vice chairman
 
02:24:46.429 --> 02:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
taking the question more of a statement
 
02:24:51.550 --> 02:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
would you believe some decades
 
02:24:54.910 --> 02:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
ago we were running I was selectman and
 
02:24:57.150 --> 02:24:57.160 align:start position:0%
we were running out of ballots and I
 
02:24:59.030 --> 02:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
called the Secretary of State's office
 
02:25:01.389 --> 02:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
and they said oh we have some and I
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
still couldn't now till this day why
 
02:25:06.830 --> 02:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
would you have more balance that we
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have and you answered the
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
question so and that's it's a good point
 
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
that our state law has a process for
 
02:25:18.830 --> 02:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with time that might run out of
 
02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
ballots and in the first instance uh
 
02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
when when a town runs out of official
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
ballots they're supposed to keep
 
02:25:32.070 --> 02:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
one uh and then start using leftover
 
02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots the clerk should
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
initial those to make them official
 
02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
ballots and then they can be passed out
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
to the voters if the town runs out of
 
02:25:44.910 --> 02:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballots Then That official
 
02:25:48.670 --> 02:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
ballot that was held can be copied uh
 
02:25:51.150 --> 02:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
but the clerk has to initial every
 
02:25:54.389 --> 02:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
single copy that is used making that an
 
02:25:56.510 --> 02:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
official ballot and then those have to
 
02:25:58.349 --> 02:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
be accounted for in the inventory at the
 
02:26:01.230 --> 02:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
end of the night uh you when the
 
02:26:03.469 --> 02:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
moderator is filling out the
 
02:26:05.910 --> 02:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork fun times further questions
 
02:26:08.710 --> 02:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative P Brian thank you uh I
 
02:26:10.590 --> 02:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate the invitation to see the
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
ballots printed and I'll take you up on
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
that we have that happening soon with
 
02:26:17.230 --> 02:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
the local elections so um before you go
 
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
any further on that the the towns are
 
02:26:22.030 --> 02:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for the ballots at their
 
02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
local election so the next
 
02:26:26.670 --> 02:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh for the state will be
 
02:26:29.429 --> 02:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
leading up to the state primary thank
 
02:26:31.389 --> 02:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative wood oh I
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
had a followup
 
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
but all right you can have your followup
 
02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so I don't want to cast
 
02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
dispersions on any specific printing
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
company so I'll just say in general if
 
02:26:44.830 --> 02:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
there was a printing
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
company that was in involved in printing
 
02:26:49.950 --> 02:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
ballots and they were very if they were
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
very sloppy and they took their extra
 
02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
printed ballots and they just put them
 
02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:55.309 align:start position:0%
printed ballots and they just put them
unattended

02:26:55.309 --> 02:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
unattended
 
02:26:58.030 --> 02:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
outside you're confident that even if a
 
02:27:01.469 --> 02:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
company was sloppy like that that your
 
02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
process would be
 
02:27:08.150 --> 02:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
um would would have the highest of uh
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
integrity and there wouldn't
 
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
be the option for someone to take those
 
02:27:15.269 --> 02:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
ballots and put them into the system and
 
02:27:17.790 --> 02:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
then try to cast them as if they were
 
02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
voters that had cast them um so we would
 
02:27:23.429 --> 02:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
not deal with a sloppy printer company
 
02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
and and the printing of ballots is one
 
02:27:28.269 --> 02:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
area where we don't have to go out to
 
02:27:31.269 --> 02:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
bid you know to find a printer we can go
 
02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
with a printer that we know we'll do a
 
02:27:37.230 --> 02:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
good job you know that we trust uh we
 
02:27:40.590 --> 02:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
keep the local the printer local so that
 
02:27:42.670 --> 02:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
if we have to you know react quickly to
 
02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
some issue uh you know we can do that um
 
02:27:49.150 --> 02:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
so the printer that we have now um and
 
02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
the printer that we had uh probably a
 
02:27:53.870 --> 02:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
dozen years ago that was different we
 
02:27:57.630 --> 02:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
had the highest confidence in uh you the
 
02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
way they ran their business you know was
 
02:28:02.510 --> 02:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
all first class um and they worked with
 
02:28:03.870 --> 02:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
us very very
 
02:28:06.990 --> 02:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
well representative wood thank you Mr
 
02:28:09.790 --> 02:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
chair thank you m Mr secretary uh thank
 
02:28:13.070 --> 02:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
you for the explanation on uh the early
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
explanation now I know you explanation
 
02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
was a thorough but looking at this um
 
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
inventory control on the front end when
 
02:28:23.830 --> 02:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
the order do you feel that this is
 
02:28:25.030 --> 02:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
already being
 
02:28:27.269 --> 02:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
accomplished from what you understand of
 
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
the of the spill yes yes we keep track
 
02:28:32.349 --> 02:28:32.359 align:start position:0%
of the numbers that are being requested
 
02:28:35.389 --> 02:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
at the front end um and and as I said
 
02:28:37.870 --> 02:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
you know we can Pro produce those okay
 
02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
so if the follow up please uh so if
 
02:28:43.349 --> 02:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
there is um
 
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
overruns um that are outside of what you
 
02:28:48.750 --> 02:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
they normally expect you would know that
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
what you normally expect because usually
 
02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
when you do printing there's normal
 
02:28:55.150 --> 02:28:55.160 align:start position:0%
overruns and there's accidental overruns
 
02:28:58.190 --> 02:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
those those there's very sta varying
 
02:29:00.550 --> 02:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
stages but you feel that's under control
 
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes and so the overruns are put on these
 
02:29:09.630 --> 02:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
carts and they are kept you know in our
 
02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
staff Presence at the printer so you
 
02:29:14.269 --> 02:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
know we know where they are if if
 
02:29:16.110 --> 02:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
there's a request for overruns from a
 
02:29:16.120 --> 02:29:17.230 align:start position:0%
there's a request for overruns from a
town

02:29:17.230 --> 02:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:29:18.990 --> 02:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
it's my staff that are the ones that go
 
02:29:21.950 --> 02:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
and retrieve it box it seal it and make
 
02:29:23.469 --> 02:29:23.479 align:start position:0%
sure the towns get
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
it thank you further
 
02:29:28.349 --> 02:29:28.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative P
 
02:29:31.150 --> 02:29:31.160 align:start position:0%
Brian again thank you for that detailed
 
02:29:32.750 --> 02:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
explanation I really appreciate it I
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate your conscientiousness and
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
the conscientiousness of the printer
 
02:29:38.429 --> 02:29:38.439 align:start position:0%
that you work with and that you choose
 
02:29:40.510 --> 02:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
for those uh
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
attributes should this be codified in
 
02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
law so that seven eight 10 Secretary of
 
02:29:47.910 --> 02:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
States in the future we'll be using the
 
02:29:50.349 --> 02:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
exact same process and the and the and
 
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
people will know that that's what's
 
02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
happening that's a question I had not
 
02:29:59.950 --> 02:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
um I my preference would be to leave it
 
02:30:05.150 --> 02:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
like it is you know and then if if
 
02:30:07.070 --> 02:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
there's an issue in the future then you
 
02:30:09.349 --> 02:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
know then tighten the screws a little
 
02:30:12.190 --> 02:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
bit but during the time that we were
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
printing the ballots the the printer
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
actually keeps the doors to the building
 
02:30:20.550 --> 02:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
locked even during business hours you
 
02:30:22.630 --> 02:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
know for somebody to enter they have to
 
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
ring the doorbell to get in and then
 
02:30:27.309 --> 02:30:27.319 align:start position:0%
there's a log that's kept of every
 
02:30:30.790 --> 02:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
single person that enters uh the
 
02:30:33.550 --> 02:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
building with their contact
 
02:30:36.469 --> 02:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
information further questions seeing
 
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
none thank you Mr secretary I don't have

02:31:18.670 --> 02:31:18.680 align:start position:0%
number of ballots as um and I saw
 
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
represent Andrews are you here to
 
02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill representive
 
02:31:37.710 --> 02:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:40.670 --> 02:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
yes good morning honorable house
 
02:31:43.309 --> 02:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
election committee I am here this
 
02:31:47.030 --> 02:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
morning regarding this bill and
 
02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
is there was an issue in my district and
 
02:31:52.630 --> 02:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
we would never have known about it if
 
02:31:54.150 --> 02:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
there hadn't been a
 
02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
recount now in the end these papers I'm
 
02:32:00.670 --> 02:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
passing passing around had the rec has
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
the recount in my district and I believe
 
02:32:07.550 --> 02:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
there is a problem and maybe other
 
02:32:09.389 --> 02:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
districts where they hand count the
 
02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
ballots 14 errors in 5 PBS is not
 
02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
acceptable I've been a bookkeeper all my
 
02:32:18.630 --> 02:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
life and uh one in one always had to
 
02:32:21.190 --> 02:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
make two
 
02:32:24.269 --> 02:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
and I realize people are tired at the
 
02:32:26.110 --> 02:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
end of the day when they count the
 
02:32:28.429 --> 02:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
ballots and all that but we have to do
 
02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:36.110 --> 02:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
recount somebody might have been W lost
 
02:32:39.230 --> 02:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
the election and just walked away and I
 
02:32:41.309 --> 02:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
would probably one of those people that
 
02:32:42.670 --> 02:32:42.680 align:start position:0%
would have just walked away and never
 
02:32:43.950 --> 02:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
asked for a
 
02:32:47.309 --> 02:32:47.319 align:start position:0%
recount I don't know all the answers to
 
02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
this and I'm looking to each member of
 
02:32:52.190 --> 02:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
you on the committee to help and I'm not
 
02:32:54.750 --> 02:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
going to keep you because like I said I
 
02:32:56.910 --> 02:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
don't have all the answers I just wish
 
02:33:01.469 --> 02:33:01.479 align:start position:0%
we could find a way in the law to make
 
02:33:01.479 --> 02:33:03.030 align:start position:0%
we could find a way in the law to make
people

02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:33:05.990 --> 02:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
accountable when they count the ballots
 
02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:09.389 align:start position:0%
accountable when they count the ballots

02:33:13.030 --> 02:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
02:33:15.550 --> 02:33:15.560 align:start position:0%
Andrews yep okay she had to think about
 
02:33:17.710 --> 02:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
it so everybody very nice are the
 
02:33:19.750 --> 02:33:19.760 align:start position:0%

representative
 
02:33:26.269 --> 02:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
Andrews one other pink card is deputy
 
02:33:35.269 --> 02:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
Hennessy good morning everyone Aaron
 
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
Hennessy deputy secretary of
 
02:33:42.990 --> 02:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
state um a little bit of background uh
 
02:33:44.950 --> 02:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
when we do our training for our election
 
02:33:47.030 --> 02:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
officials um and I I know some of you in
 
02:33:49.429 --> 02:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
here have gone to that training uh we do
 
02:33:52.670 --> 02:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of talking um either in person or
 
02:33:54.389 --> 02:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
um in our online trainings about
 
02:33:58.469 --> 02:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
reconciliation process as a CPA um
 
02:34:00.870 --> 02:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
non-practicing I love um when numbers
 
02:34:04.110 --> 02:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
work out and uh doing reconciliation was
 
02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
something I did in my former life um so
 
02:34:10.110 --> 02:34:10.120 align:start position:0%
I usually take over the training on the
 
02:34:13.389 --> 02:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
reconciliation process um one different
 
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
thing we did this year in the
 
02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:16.640 align:start position:0%
presidential primary
 
02:34:19.429 --> 02:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
um was that for each of the um ballots
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
um for the return of votes not the
 
02:34:23.510 --> 02:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
actual ballots um The Return of votes
 
02:34:25.190 --> 02:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
were set up like a
 
02:34:27.429 --> 02:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
Reconciliation and we could do this
 
02:34:31.710 --> 02:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
because um there was just one One race
 
02:34:33.510 --> 02:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
um even though there was many candidates
 
02:34:36.150 --> 02:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
on it there was one race so we set it up
 
02:34:40.349 --> 02:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
to um show um to help the moderators
 
02:34:42.990 --> 02:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
reconcile the number of ballots uh the
 
02:34:45.429 --> 02:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
number of votes cast for a candidate
 
02:34:47.790 --> 02:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
including the rins um the number of
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
undervotes and the number of
 
02:34:52.349 --> 02:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
overvotes um and yes there are
 
02:34:56.070 --> 02:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
undervotes um even with um just one um
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
race being run so
 
02:35:01.550 --> 02:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
um some of the um reconciliations were
 
02:35:07.630 --> 02:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
done really well um some of them had
 
02:35:10.150 --> 02:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
difficulty one of the issues that we we
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
came across with the reporting of
 
02:35:14.790 --> 02:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
undervotes on the election return this
 
02:35:19.790 --> 02:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
year was that um there was a big um
 
02:35:23.349 --> 02:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
campaign for a write in campaign and the
 
02:35:26.990 --> 02:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
way a um our acote system uh B
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting devices are
 
02:35:31.790 --> 02:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
set up is that if a ballot is completely
 
02:35:35.389 --> 02:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
blank um so in a um in a presidential
 
02:35:37.309 --> 02:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
primary election if somebody didn't fill
 
02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
in the oval but they wrote a name in The
 
02:35:41.269 --> 02:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
Ballot accounting device would see that
 
02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
as a completely Bank blank ballot those
 
02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
are um diverted into different bin um or
 
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
if the diverter is not working at some
 
02:35:51.830 --> 02:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
places they they manually go through
 
02:35:53.429 --> 02:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
every single ballot to see if there's
 
02:35:56.710 --> 02:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
any writings um but the um if it is
 
02:35:58.990 --> 02:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
diverted um the ballot counting device
 
02:36:03.150 --> 02:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
will report that as an undervote um and
 
02:36:05.070 --> 02:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
the counting the hand counting teams
 
02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
will see those ballots and they will see
 
02:36:09.230 --> 02:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
them as a write in for a candidate as
 
02:36:10.790 --> 02:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
they're instructed to do because if
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
somebody writes the a name in but
 
02:36:14.309 --> 02:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't fill in the oval the voter
 
02:36:16.070 --> 02:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
intent is for that person who they WR
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
the a in for but one interesting thing
 
02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
on the reconciliation or the return of
 
02:36:23.630 --> 02:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
votes was that some of our towns didn't
 
02:36:26.269 --> 02:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
realize that they have to reduce the
 
02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
number of O undervotes because they've
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
increased the number of of wrin um so
 
02:36:33.429 --> 02:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
that was a a
 
02:36:35.910 --> 02:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
tricky a tricky thing that some of our
 
02:36:38.630 --> 02:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
moderators didn't quite grasp with this
 
02:36:40.590 --> 02:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
um with this election in particular and
 
02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
I think just the number of wrin votes um
 
02:36:46.349 --> 02:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
Statewide really put a highlight on that
 
02:36:48.750 --> 02:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
so we will be planning on doing more
 
02:36:51.790 --> 02:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
training on the um on the undervote side
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
of things where even though you're tape
 
02:36:56.429 --> 02:36:56.439 align:start position:0%
says one thing for undervotes you have
 
02:36:59.309 --> 02:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
to reconcile it to the number of writin
 
02:37:01.230 --> 02:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
that you've recorded where the bubble
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
was not filled in so that being said um
 
02:37:06.269 --> 02:37:06.279 align:start position:0%
I want I just wanted to give you this
 
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
story to show you that the
 
02:37:10.230 --> 02:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
reconciliation process is not an easy
 
02:37:13.349 --> 02:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
process um especially for somebody um
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
who doesn't deal with numbers all the
 
02:37:18.870 --> 02:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
time and and say um it's midnight or if
 
02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
you were with me in Windom um past
 
02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:23.150 align:start position:0%
you were with me in Windom um past
midnight

02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
midnight
 
02:37:26.429 --> 02:37:26.439 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not an easy process um so
 
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
there there are um some mistakes that
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
are made but um in looking at the
 
02:37:34.269 --> 02:37:34.279 align:start position:0%
language of this bill this would require
 
02:37:37.590 --> 02:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
that um every reconciliation would be
 
02:37:40.269 --> 02:37:40.279 align:start position:0%
done um on the return of votes but it
 
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
does not require um the reconciliation
 
02:37:46.110 --> 02:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
to include overvotes um and that would
 
02:37:49.469 --> 02:37:49.479 align:start position:0%
be um I see that just as a an error
 
02:37:50.750 --> 02:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
because you always have to include
 
02:37:53.150 --> 02:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
overvotes um in your reconciliation
 
02:37:55.469 --> 02:37:55.479 align:start position:0%
otherwise um you don't get the total
 
02:37:58.110 --> 02:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
number of um votes cast we call it some
 
02:38:01.510 --> 02:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
of all votes so um I would if you're
 
02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to pass this bill I would
 
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
recommend you include overvotes but one
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
thing that we would have would be
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
difficult for our office to do would be
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
to include a Reconciliation on the
 
02:38:16.269 --> 02:38:16.279 align:start position:0%
return of votes for every single office
 
02:38:18.469 --> 02:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
or question on the ballot so in the
 
02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
general election um we would have to
 
02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
include a Reconciliation on the return
 
02:38:25.230 --> 02:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
of votes for every single race that
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
there is including any constitutional
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
question or if your town is going to
 
02:38:32.830 --> 02:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
vote on changing your polling hours um
 
02:38:35.590 --> 02:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to get an extremely
 
02:38:39.190 --> 02:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
lengthy number of pages for each return
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
of votes um
 
02:38:45.269 --> 02:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
and um in our training we always train
 
02:38:47.269 --> 02:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
our ction officials to do
 
02:38:49.269 --> 02:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
reconciliations we have not trained them
 
02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
to do um a Reconciliation for every
 
02:38:55.870 --> 02:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
single question or um or race uh we we
 
02:38:58.269 --> 02:38:58.279 align:start position:0%
do recommend that they do at least three
 
02:38:59.830 --> 02:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
um just to make sure that everything has
 
02:39:01.990 --> 02:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
reconciled and for your information the
 
02:39:03.630 --> 02:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
reconciliation would be the sum of all
 
02:39:06.429 --> 02:39:06.439 align:start position:0%
votes to the number of ballots cast to
 
02:39:08.790 --> 02:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
the number of Voters checking in so it's
 
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
we call it the three legs of our stool
 
02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
so the number of votings Voters checking
 
02:39:14.590 --> 02:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
in should equal the number of physical
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
ballots that were cast should equal the
 
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
sum of all votes that were cast with
 
02:39:21.710 --> 02:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take questions other
 
02:39:24.550 --> 02:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
questions from the commit represent
 
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
gab thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I guess this
 
02:39:31.910 --> 02:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
particular sheet doesn't have the number
 
02:39:35.269 --> 02:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
of undervotes on here however I do see
 
02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
some of the Merit in it because I know
 
02:39:40.349 --> 02:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
when I look to win even in the recount
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
that was done for example there was two
 
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
recounts done one for district uh 17 and
 
02:39:48.750 --> 02:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
one for District 35 District 35 happened
 
02:39:51.630 --> 02:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
at like 10: in the morning and I don't
 
02:39:54.269 --> 02:39:54.279 align:start position:0%
know District 17 was at like 12:30 but
 
02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
nonetheless if you look at the at the
 
02:39:58.910 --> 02:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
voters checked in it was
 
02:40:01.750 --> 02:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
2033 and then if you end up looking at
 
02:40:04.230 --> 02:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
the district 35 recount it equates to
 
02:40:07.309 --> 02:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
226 ballots and then the 17 recount
 
02:40:11.510 --> 02:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
equates to 232 ballots so it seems like
 
02:40:13.150 --> 02:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
in between those two recounts there were
 
02:40:14.670 --> 02:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
definitely some ballots missing and I
 
02:40:16.269 --> 02:40:16.279 align:start position:0%
could see the same thing potentially
 
02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
knowing how thoroughly it's done at the
 
02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
recount and there were still B ballots
 
02:40:23.590 --> 02:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
missing that there could be some done
 
02:40:26.190 --> 02:40:26.200 align:start position:0%
some missing at the election but I guess
 
02:40:27.910 --> 02:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
what would we do if they did realize
 
02:40:29.750 --> 02:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
that there was some missing what what
 
02:40:31.550 --> 02:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
Authority would the town have if they
 
02:40:33.750 --> 02:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
said hey our numbers aren't working out
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
the right way it seems like some of
 
02:40:36.670 --> 02:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
these votes weren't counted what could
 
02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
they do about
 
02:40:40.750 --> 02:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
it um so I think there was a lot of
 
02:40:43.309 --> 02:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
questions in there but um sorry I I
 
02:40:44.670 --> 02:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't know what you're
 
02:40:48.349 --> 02:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
looking at in front of you um
 
02:40:50.590 --> 02:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
but I don't sorry I don't know what that
 
02:40:53.469 --> 02:40:53.479 align:start position:0%
is um I don't I don't have it it's the
 
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
original numbers of the votes in this
 
02:40:56.630 --> 02:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
district and then the recounts that
 
02:40:58.630 --> 02:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
happened after but the the overvotes are
 
02:41:01.110 --> 02:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
missing from here so that's why I just
 
02:41:03.150 --> 02:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
equated another District where I did see
 
02:41:04.910 --> 02:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
that some the numbers are off in that
 
02:41:07.030 --> 02:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
one as well so that's why I was so yeah
 
02:41:08.830 --> 02:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
to do a proper reconciliation you would
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
need the overvotes um otherwise the
 
02:41:13.590 --> 02:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
numbers are not going to reconcile
 
02:41:16.990 --> 02:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
unless there were no overvotes um to
 
02:41:19.710 --> 02:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
what uh secretary scanland testified to
 
02:41:23.269 --> 02:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
in in the last um in the last bill um
 
02:41:26.670 --> 02:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
this is a human process um and I and I
 
02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
if anyone has not been to a recount I
 
02:41:30.910 --> 02:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
recommend going there um there are two
 
02:41:33.110 --> 02:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
people that physically count each of the
 
02:41:37.230 --> 02:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
ballots um and they take turns um
 
02:41:40.110 --> 02:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes you will witness um the two
 
02:41:42.349 --> 02:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
people not having the same number and so
 
02:41:44.590 --> 02:41:44.600 align:start position:0%
they count and they count and they count
 
02:41:46.910 --> 02:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
so there is there's sometimes where the
 
02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
ballots will stick together and they
 
02:41:50.429 --> 02:41:50.439 align:start position:0%
just cannot even though how many times
 
02:41:51.630 --> 02:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
one person counts it they're not going
 
02:41:53.550 --> 02:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
to get the same number but they stay
 
02:41:55.910 --> 02:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
until they figure oh yes you got 25 I
 
02:41:59.230 --> 02:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
got 25 so that just goes to highlight
 
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
there may be an instance where one
 
02:42:03.870 --> 02:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
person counts it two ballots were stuck
 
02:42:05.469 --> 02:42:05.479 align:start position:0%
together another person counts it two
 
02:42:08.190 --> 02:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
ballots were stuck together so I can't
 
02:42:10.870 --> 02:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
explain why and I haven't looked at it
 
02:42:13.469 --> 02:42:13.479 align:start position:0%
what um why those count of those ballots
 
02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
would be different but they're there
 
02:42:17.389 --> 02:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
could be instances where two people
 
02:42:19.349 --> 02:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
count the same pile and they come up
 
02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
with the same number but it is an
 
02:42:25.830 --> 02:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
incorrect number because it is a human
 
02:42:28.750 --> 02:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
process yes that's fine so I guess what
 
02:42:30.830 --> 02:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'm asking is though if they did this
 
02:42:32.590 --> 02:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
process where they realized at the night
 
02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the election
 
02:42:36.910 --> 02:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
that counting the overvotes undervotes
 
02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
and like let's say it was a vote vote
 
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
four they divided and they said nope
 
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
like we were supposed to have 2,000
 
02:42:44.590 --> 02:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
ballots this is only accounting for
 
02:42:47.790 --> 02:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
19900 90 ballots if we did this process
 
02:42:49.790 --> 02:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
what what value is it going to add
 
02:42:51.230 --> 02:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
because what can they do with that
 
02:42:52.830 --> 02:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
information how can they figure out
 
02:42:54.429 --> 02:42:54.439 align:start position:0%
where those 10 votes are missing from
 
02:42:55.950 --> 02:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
what Authority do they have to check
 
02:42:57.030 --> 02:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
that I guess is what I'm really trying
 
02:42:58.510 --> 02:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
to get at so at the the night of the
 
02:43:00.590 --> 02:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
election we train the moderators not to
 
02:43:02.190 --> 02:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
announce the results until they've done
 
02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:02.910 align:start position:0%
announce the results until they've done
a

02:43:02.910 --> 02:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:43:05.070 --> 02:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
Reconciliation um and I've been at a
 
02:43:06.990 --> 02:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
polling location where they realize that
 
02:43:10.070 --> 02:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
they did not include the um ballots from
 
02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
the side pocket the some some places
 
02:43:14.910 --> 02:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
they have very few side pocket ballots
 
02:43:16.510 --> 02:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
they did removed those side pocket
 
02:43:17.950 --> 02:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
ballots they just didn't include them in
 
02:43:20.030 --> 02:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
their final count and once they did it
 
02:43:22.030 --> 02:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
was within one or two votes and they
 
02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
were happy that they had done that
 
02:43:25.309 --> 02:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
reconciliation because otherwise those
 
02:43:27.150 --> 02:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
side pet ballots wouldn't have been
 
02:43:29.670 --> 02:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
counted so they they have authority to
 
02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
continue to count until they've
 
02:43:34.190 --> 02:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
announced their numbers and taped
 
02:43:36.150 --> 02:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
everything up and sealed it and once the
 
02:43:37.910 --> 02:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
ballots are sealed in the boxes they
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't have an authority to open them
 
02:43:42.630 --> 02:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
back up representative Howard thank you
 
02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:43:46.469 --> 02:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
question uh so because the uh
 
02:43:48.550 --> 02:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
reconciliation does happen at the end of
 
02:43:54.590 --> 02:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
the night and uh under uh RSA 659 73 uh
 
02:43:58.190 --> 02:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
section 4 uh part L there is the
 
02:44:00.910 --> 02:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
statement of for each contest or ballot
 
02:44:03.469 --> 02:44:03.479 align:start position:0%
question the number of overvotes and
 
02:44:07.230 --> 02:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
undervotes uh so and of course that's
 
02:44:09.469 --> 02:44:09.479 align:start position:0%
under uh section four which states the
 
02:44:12.269 --> 02:44:12.279 align:start position:0%
moderator shall fill out a moderator uh
 
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:13.920 align:start position:0%

closing the polls or other time ordered
 
02:44:22.230 --> 02:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
by the Secretary of State and submitted
 
02:44:24.030 --> 02:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
to the clerk uh the worksheet shall
 
02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
include uh set information uh because
 
02:44:29.429 --> 02:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
this already takes place and is already
 
02:44:32.110 --> 02:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
covered by part L uh is there a reason
 
02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:38.230 --> 02:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for the question um I and
 
02:44:40.150 --> 02:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
I I can't speak to the intent of the
 
02:44:41.950 --> 02:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor but I think the sponsor was
 
02:44:44.910 --> 02:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
actually looking for a Reconciliation
 
02:44:47.950 --> 02:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
and and I don't maybe if you choose to
 
02:44:50.070 --> 02:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
do this you would specify what that
 
02:44:52.389 --> 02:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
reconciliation would include I know we
 
02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
train people that the reconciliation is
 
02:44:57.630 --> 02:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
to sum of all votes the number of Voters
 
02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
checking in and the ballots
 
02:45:02.469 --> 02:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
cast thank you further questions from
 
02:45:05.550 --> 02:45:05.560 align:start position:0%

02:45:38.389 --> 02:45:38.399 align:start position:0%

02:45:38.399 --> 02:45:39.309 align:start position:0%

voters we're a vote 10 town for State
 
02:45:44.910 --> 02:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
Rep you want to talk about a race that's
 
02:45:46.510 --> 02:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
difficult ult to
 
02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
reconcile I will tell you however um
 
02:45:51.830 --> 02:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
that something that gets forgotten and
 
02:45:53.309 --> 02:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
there's lots of people that like to look
 
02:45:56.269 --> 02:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
at numbers and they play they do the
 
02:45:58.070 --> 02:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
math and they do all these
 
02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
things when you report your total voters
 
02:46:02.269 --> 02:46:02.279 align:start position:0%
you report your total
 
02:46:04.590 --> 02:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
voters on that
 
02:46:09.790 --> 02:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
day not every voter in a September
 
02:46:13.429 --> 02:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
primary or a November race or a November
 
02:46:16.950 --> 02:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
election is actually eligible to vote in
 
02:46:18.469 --> 02:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
every single
 
02:46:21.469 --> 02:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
race so that reconciliation you need to
 
02:46:23.070 --> 02:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
be very careful when looking at your
 
02:46:25.269 --> 02:46:25.279 align:start position:0%
total voters versus total
 
02:46:27.550 --> 02:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
votes um because there are federal
 
02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
office only voters so if you're looking
 
02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
at the total voters that voted in an
 
02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
election and you want the numbers to all
 
02:46:38.670 --> 02:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
total that may not happen on the further
 
02:46:41.950 --> 02:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
down ballot races that are not federal
 
02:46:44.349 --> 02:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
and I don't know what exactly you were
 
02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
looking at but I just want to make sure
 
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
that everybody is aware that a
 
02:46:53.110 --> 02:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
Reconciliation like this would need to
 
02:46:55.870 --> 02:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
actually break that all out um and
 
02:46:59.030 --> 02:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about pages and pages of
 
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
paperwork we actually use a spreadsheet
 
02:47:05.110 --> 02:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
in Dair to keep track of this um I I
 
02:47:07.790 --> 02:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
know some other towns do as well to make
 
02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
sure that we have counted all votes at
 
02:47:13.309 --> 02:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
the end of the night but um I I don't
 
02:47:16.429 --> 02:47:16.439 align:start position:0%
know what all the other towns do but I
 
02:47:19.469 --> 02:47:19.479 align:start position:0%
do want to caution people from just um
 
02:47:22.429 --> 02:47:22.439 align:start position:0%
looking at something and thinking oh
 
02:47:24.630 --> 02:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
well it should all total CU sometimes
 
02:47:26.830 --> 02:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
that number may change based on the
 
02:47:29.429 --> 02:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
eligible voters that's all and I will
 
02:47:31.870 --> 02:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
take any questions okay any questions
 
02:47:34.030 --> 02:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
about the dreaded Foo ballot federal
 
02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:35.030 align:start position:0%
about the dreaded Foo ballot federal
office

02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
only all right seeing none thank you um
 
02:47:39.550 --> 02:47:39.560 align:start position:0%

02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet was empty online there
 
02:47:44.990 --> 02:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
was 31 people signed in in support to
 
02:47:47.269 --> 02:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
opposed uh with that I'm going to close

they're usually overseas voters yeah and
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%

committee is currently in caucus during
 
04:01:33.189 --> 04:01:33.199 align:start position:0%

04:01:52.670 --> 04:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative Alvin C from Lowden and I
 
04:01:55.389 --> 04:01:55.399 align:start position:0%

04:01:59.429 --> 04:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
District in marac County um I'm
 
04:02:01.790 --> 04:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
introducing House Bill
 
04:02:05.990 --> 04:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
1157 uh relative to over voted and under
 
04:02:08.830 --> 04:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
voted ballots and this bill was a
 
04:02:12.189 --> 04:02:12.199 align:start position:0%
intended to provide a way for the new
 
04:02:13.870 --> 04:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
digital electronic ballot counting
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
devices to prove that they can process
 
04:02:18.750 --> 04:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
ballots without having large numbers of
 
04:02:20.990 --> 04:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
reported overvotes as we have seen with
 
04:02:22.429 --> 04:02:22.439 align:start position:0%
the old ACU vote
 
04:02:24.550 --> 04:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
machines i'
 
04:02:26.830 --> 04:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
originally I was originally encouraged
 
04:02:29.750 --> 04:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
to make the uh legislation consistent
 
04:02:32.469 --> 04:02:32.479 align:start position:0%
with all devices authorized to use for
 
04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
use in New Hampshire and that all voters
 
04:02:36.910 --> 04:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
would have equal experience but on
 
04:02:38.990 --> 04:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
reflection there there will never be
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
equal experiences
 
04:02:43.950 --> 04:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
for uh for all voters since some voters
 
04:02:45.990 --> 04:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
will be in machine count towns others in
 
04:02:49.510 --> 04:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
hand count towns uh other cases would be
 
04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
iners versus absentee voting and we can
 
04:02:54.429 --> 04:02:54.439 align:start position:0%
make a long list of
 
04:02:59.870 --> 04:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
of there two two classes of uh voters so
 
04:03:03.269 --> 04:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
um with that i' like to introduce
 
04:03:06.309 --> 04:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2024
 
04:03:10.070 --> 04:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
0589 h to address the new digital ball
 
04:03:11.870 --> 04:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
counting devices and to take advantage
 
04:03:13.990 --> 04:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
of features that these devices have to
 
04:03:16.550 --> 04:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
enhance the voting
 
04:03:18.870 --> 04:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
experience okay is that all you got for
 
04:03:21.910 --> 04:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
us um I'd like to uh continue to discuss
 
04:03:24.110 --> 04:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment if I may you I will I will
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
allow the hearing to continue on the
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
amendment as a courtesy without
 
04:03:31.030 --> 04:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
objection thank you uh the amendment
 
04:03:34.750 --> 04:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
calls for the uh new devices to be
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
programmed to um when when you put a
 
04:03:41.110 --> 04:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
ballot in before you before it actually
 
04:03:44.189 --> 04:03:44.199 align:start position:0%
counts and adds in the total of B votes
 
04:03:47.429 --> 04:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
on it hold it if it detects any
 
04:03:50.189 --> 04:03:50.199 align:start position:0%
overvotes undervotes or blank
 
04:03:54.149 --> 04:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
ballots and gives the in-person voter a
 
04:03:57.990 --> 04:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
chance to um take the ballot back to
 
04:04:02.910 --> 04:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
correct it or to uh pass it uh have the
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
machine accepted as
 
04:04:10.110 --> 04:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
is the um and this this is a
 
04:04:13.670 --> 04:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
um uh something that the uh help America
 
04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
voter Act is is uh wants us to
 
04:04:22.389 --> 04:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
do as written the U this amendment will
 
04:04:24.790 --> 04:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
leave the old ACU votes alone without
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
any changes these devices will still be
 
04:04:29.429 --> 04:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
programmed to return to the voter any
 
04:04:34.030 --> 04:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
ballot which the device detects as an
 
04:04:36.550 --> 04:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
overvote the new digital ballot counting
 
04:04:38.389 --> 04:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
devices use different techn know you to
 
04:04:41.149 --> 04:04:41.159 align:start position:0%
read the ballots and determine how the
 
04:04:43.510 --> 04:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
voter cast his or her
 
04:04:46.189 --> 04:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
votes this should be much more immune to
 
04:04:48.550 --> 04:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
incorrectly detecting overvotes as
 
04:04:51.429 --> 04:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
compared to the old ACU vote devices the
 
04:04:53.149 --> 04:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
new devices will still need to be
 
04:04:54.990 --> 04:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
programmed to report the number of
 
04:04:57.710 --> 04:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
overvotes and undervotes for each office
 
04:05:00.189 --> 04:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
or question on the ballot so that they
 
04:05:05.189 --> 04:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
can um be on the uh election night
 
04:05:09.469 --> 04:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
returns uh per RSA
 
04:05:11.910 --> 04:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
the candidates in cities and towns using
 
04:05:14.269 --> 04:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
new devices should closely monitor
 
04:05:17.149 --> 04:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
election night reports as to the number
 
04:05:20.269 --> 04:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
of overvotes and computer with um
 
04:05:22.229 --> 04:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
compare with results of
 
04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:29.910 --> 04:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
needed and this should be done even if
 
04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill and amendment is not pass
 
04:05:36.189 --> 04:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
the new machine should be watched
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
closely when the absence ballots are
 
04:05:41.469 --> 04:05:41.479 align:start position:0%
being processed if they're being run
 
04:05:43.550 --> 04:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
through the machine the election
 
04:05:46.229 --> 04:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
official can just select the accept the
 
04:05:47.469 --> 04:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
ballot as
 
04:05:50.950 --> 04:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
is uh it's not stated in the bill but
 
04:05:55.070 --> 04:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
the election official May uh put in the
 
04:05:57.630 --> 04:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
um bot absentee ballots in the auxiliary
 
04:06:00.269 --> 04:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
compartment for later hand counting if
 
04:06:02.269 --> 04:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
they detect things that may make the
 
04:06:04.910 --> 04:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
ballot unreadable such as a torn Ballot
 
04:06:08.910 --> 04:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
or um tape on it or any other issues
 
04:06:14.269 --> 04:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:19.070 --> 04:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
them and um the only um other thing that
 
04:06:24.070 --> 04:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
ought to be U looked at just in in case
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
you want to consider it um if the
 
04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
ballots are returned for undervotes that
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
may slow down the election process for
 
04:06:33.600 --> 04:06:34.309 align:start position:0%
may slow down the election process for
the

04:06:34.309 --> 04:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:06:37.630 --> 04:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
whole um election simply because a lot
 
04:06:40.469 --> 04:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
of of people don't bother voting for all
 
04:06:42.910 --> 04:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
offices on the ballot so that could be
 
04:06:47.309 --> 04:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
an issue um and you you could amend this
 
04:06:50.590 --> 04:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
to just only deal with overvotes if you
 
04:06:50.600 --> 04:06:51.309 align:start position:0%
to just only deal with overvotes if you
uh

04:06:51.309 --> 04:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:06:54.830 --> 04:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
wanted um so with that I'd like to
 
04:06:57.070 --> 04:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
encourage you to vote off to pass with
 
04:07:00.830 --> 04:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
the bill and the amendment and uh
 
04:07:02.950 --> 04:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I would like to take
 
04:07:04.950 --> 04:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
questions but I need to run back to my
 
04:07:07.309 --> 04:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
committee for exec session all right
 
04:07:09.510 --> 04:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative c um I don't
 
04:07:12.830 --> 04:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
have any other pink cards on this bill
 
04:07:16.149 --> 04:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
um if you could pass the blue sheet over
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
um online
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
1157 had 18 people in support nine
 
04:07:25.630 --> 04:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
opposed um and I'm going is the sheet
 
04:07:27.670 --> 04:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
blank same me the
 
04:07:31.109 --> 04:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
time no no somebody signed
 
04:07:35.149 --> 04:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
in one one one person signed up not
 
04:07:37.830 --> 04:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
speaking that was opposed uh with that
 
04:07:39.510 --> 04:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public hearing on

both parties take this respective time
 
04:07:50.910 --> 04:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
to caucus before our executive session
 
04:07:52.189 --> 04:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
so that we can get out of here even
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:06.640 --> 04:26:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
125

04:26:46.070 --> 04:26:46.080 align:start position:0%

voter registration investigation of
 
04:27:02.910 --> 04:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
voter verification letters relative to
 
04:27:05.149 --> 04:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
the terms resident inhabitant residence
 
04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
and residen
 
04:27:08.870 --> 04:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
um I believe
 
04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative Horan is here to
 
04:27:15.870 --> 04:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:18.309 --> 04:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
law thank you I served on Election law
 
04:27:21.189 --> 04:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
my first term with uh former resident
 
04:27:23.389 --> 04:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
Bob Perry who sitting in the audience um
 
04:27:24.990 --> 04:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
I've gotten much older than them Bob is
 
04:27:26.670 --> 04:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
still the same so
 
04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh um anyway I'm represent Timothy
 
04:27:31.149 --> 04:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
Horgan from straford County District 10
 
04:27:35.510 --> 04:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
the town of Durham um which I guess is a
 
04:27:36.990 --> 04:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
may have something to do with why I
 
04:27:41.070 --> 04:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill and um and my I've
 
04:27:42.550 --> 04:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony which I submitted
 
04:27:45.149 --> 04:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
submitted to the website um and I know
 
04:27:46.950 --> 04:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
one other individual did somebody from
 
04:27:49.070 --> 04:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
granted State taxpayers and he I just
 
04:27:50.550 --> 04:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
want to caution you I don't know whether
 
04:27:52.229 --> 04:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
he's coming in or not or most of you
 
04:27:53.550 --> 04:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
probably seen the testimony he's going
 
04:27:55.630 --> 04:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
about the address on the driver's
 
04:27:57.389 --> 04:27:57.399 align:start position:0%
license being proof of residency and
 
04:27:59.229 --> 04:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily always the case
 
04:28:01.670 --> 04:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know you are when you move either
 
04:28:03.510 --> 04:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
from one state to another or within a
 
04:28:04.550 --> 04:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
state you're supposed to change your
 
04:28:06.510 --> 04:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
driver's license Within I think it's 60
 
04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
days or some period of time but the
 
04:28:10.429 --> 04:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
penalty for not doing so is merely a
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
minor motor vehicle uh violation it's
 
04:28:15.109 --> 04:28:15.119 align:start position:0%
not a MISD demeanor so you shouldn't
 
04:28:16.710 --> 04:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
lose your right to vote just because you
 
04:28:19.309 --> 04:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
forgot neglected or forgot to change
 
04:28:21.189 --> 04:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
your address on your driver's license
 
04:28:23.590 --> 04:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
but anyway just thought I'd do a
 
04:28:25.630 --> 04:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
preemptive thing without like amplifying
 
04:28:28.309 --> 04:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
his testimony too much and this bill and
 
04:28:30.710 --> 04:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sure most of you been in this
 
04:28:31.950 --> 04:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
committee for a while you certainly were
 
04:28:34.429 --> 04:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
all here last year uh it's virtually
 
04:28:37.630 --> 04:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
identical to hb40 2023 which came before
 
04:28:39.870 --> 04:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
this committee last year also the same
 
04:28:42.389 --> 04:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
as HP 538 which came to the committee 3
 
04:28:45.590 --> 04:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
years ago HP40 ended up being tabled and
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
died on the table HP 538 was introduced
 
04:28:50.590 --> 04:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
in the covid-19 emergency as one of
 
04:28:52.550 --> 04:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
several dozen bills all of which were
 
04:28:55.389 --> 04:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
ited in community which ended up never
 
04:28:57.590 --> 04:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
getting a floor vote which wasn't really
 
04:28:59.030 --> 04:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to happen but those were
 
04:29:00.550 --> 04:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
strange times and exceptional
 
04:29:04.469 --> 04:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
circumstances um and now it's 2024 and
 
04:29:09.389 --> 04:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
I'm back um HB 538 is now HB
 
04:29:11.590 --> 04:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
1149 It's a combination of two bills
 
04:29:13.269 --> 04:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
which I sponsored with many co-sponsors
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
in 2019 passed the House and Senate
 
04:29:17.830 --> 04:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
before being vetoed by the
 
04:29:21.670 --> 04:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
governor and um HB 106 covered the sing
 
04:29:24.149 --> 04:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
arounds the Senate bill which was also
 
04:29:28.269 --> 04:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
vetoed in 2019 um anyway so this bill
 
04:29:30.950 --> 04:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
looks long looks complicated if passing
 
04:29:33.149 --> 04:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
the law it would simply undo three
 
04:29:35.229 --> 04:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
earlier bills which in my opinion and
 
04:29:37.149 --> 04:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
other people opinions unfairly restrict
 
04:29:39.429 --> 04:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
voting rights generally make the voting
 
04:29:41.429 --> 04:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
process less user friendly or to put it
 
04:29:44.710 --> 04:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
in another way uh more user
 
04:29:47.550 --> 04:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
hostile and those three bills which all
 
04:29:51.229 --> 04:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
passed between 20 was 20 hp 1264 passed
 
04:29:54.750 --> 04:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
in 2018 sp3 in 2020
 
04:29:59.030 --> 04:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
2017 and S SP 318 in 2012 sp3 is one
 
04:30:01.070 --> 04:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
that made the more changes is like you
 
04:30:02.109 --> 04:30:02.119 align:start position:0%
know the most
 
04:30:04.109 --> 04:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
controversial um so I live in Durham
 
04:30:06.429 --> 04:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
which is a college town um students
 
04:30:08.630 --> 04:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
living here they're not the only voters
 
04:30:10.710 --> 04:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
who are adversely affected by the
 
04:30:13.790 --> 04:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
changes of voting right laws which uh HB
 
04:30:16.469 --> 04:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
1149 aims to undo but my constituent in
 
04:30:18.870 --> 04:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
dur was a college town they they do
 
04:30:21.229 --> 04:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
perceive uh these changes in Attack the
 
04:30:24.630 --> 04:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
students uh right to vote and then every
 
04:30:27.550 --> 04:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
any um every any citizen over the age of
 
04:30:29.389 --> 04:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
18 has the right to be vote in the
 
04:30:31.189 --> 04:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
community where he or she lives and we
 
04:30:33.830 --> 04:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
can play games with semantics but like
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
college students and other people who
 
04:30:37.590 --> 04:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
have just been in town a short time are
 
04:30:40.630 --> 04:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
still res still residents and still Idol
 
04:30:43.030 --> 04:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
to claimed the places are domicile and
 
04:30:44.990 --> 04:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
um so you have the right to live in the
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
community where you live and make that
 
04:30:49.229 --> 04:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
your domicile and it doesn't matter why
 
04:30:51.229 --> 04:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
you moved here it doesn't really we
 
04:30:52.349 --> 04:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
don't have a durational voting
 
04:30:53.790 --> 04:30:53.800 align:start position:0%
requirements it doesn't matter how long
 
04:30:55.750 --> 04:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
ago and if we had a durational voting
 
04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
requirement that's usually for about a
 
04:31:00.630 --> 04:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
month or so you know so much much
 
04:31:03.469 --> 04:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
shorter period of time than people such
 
04:31:06.429 --> 04:31:06.439 align:start position:0%
as college students it also affects uh
 
04:31:06.439 --> 04:31:07.590 align:start position:0%
as college students it also affects uh
military

04:31:07.590 --> 04:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
military
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
personnel maybe people who are people
 
04:31:11.870 --> 04:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
who think they're living someplace
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
temporarily to do a job and then stay on
 
04:31:16.189 --> 04:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
and a number of other peoples but it's
 
04:31:18.070 --> 04:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
primarily the controversy is mostly
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
about students who do have the right to
 
04:31:20.830 --> 04:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
vote in fact should be encouraged to
 
04:31:24.269 --> 04:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
vote because a good lifetime um lifetime
 
04:31:27.309 --> 04:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
um habits so the I'm Point your
 
04:31:28.990 --> 04:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
attention the second
 
04:31:32.070 --> 04:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
article article 11 part 1 of our state
 
04:31:34.030 --> 04:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
constitution all elections are to be
 
04:31:35.750 --> 04:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
free in every inhabitant of the state at
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
18 years age mother shall have an equal
 
04:31:40.229 --> 04:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
right to vote in any election every
 
04:31:42.630 --> 04:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
person shall be considered an inhabitant
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
for voting in the town Ward or
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
unincorporated place where he could
 
04:31:49.269 --> 04:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
could also at some point we should
 
04:31:50.910 --> 04:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
probably have a cicr to change that to
 
04:31:53.070 --> 04:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
he or she or they but
 
04:31:56.630 --> 04:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
anyway he has his domicile and the
 
04:31:59.229 --> 04:31:59.239 align:start position:0%
domicile um has a somewhat complicated
 
04:32:00.670 --> 04:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
concept but a lot of the commentary
 
04:32:03.550 --> 04:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
about Doan residency is just plain false
 
04:32:06.750 --> 04:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
like for example what may be about to
 
04:32:08.830 --> 04:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
hear from the grand estate taxpayers
 
04:32:11.189 --> 04:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
organization so anyway basically if you
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
live here in New Hampshire you can vote
 
04:32:14.590 --> 04:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
here period and that's what the law says
 
04:32:17.109 --> 04:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
that's what it should be and this rather
 
04:32:19.870 --> 04:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
lengthy bill is just simply putting the
 
04:32:21.309 --> 04:32:21.319 align:start position:0%
voter fors back to where they are
 
04:32:22.950 --> 04:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
because I think they more accurately
 
04:32:26.269 --> 04:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
reflected that constitutional reality so
 
04:32:29.229 --> 04:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
that's a that's my bill I know most of
 
04:32:30.750 --> 04:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
you went through the whole hearing
 
04:32:32.830 --> 04:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
almost exactly a year ago but um if you
 
04:32:34.349 --> 04:32:34.359 align:start position:0%
have any questions I'd be happy to try
 
04:32:36.030 --> 04:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
to answer them
 
04:32:39.469 --> 04:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:43.189 --> 04:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
committee representative weary yep
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
thanks uh thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:32:48.309 --> 04:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan for taking my
 
04:32:48.319 --> 04:32:50.670 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan for taking my
question

04:32:50.670 --> 04:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:32:53.590 --> 04:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm reminded of the great Cole Porter
 
04:32:57.670 --> 04:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
musical anything goes um it seems like
 
04:33:00.710 --> 04:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
you're removing any restrictions from
 
04:33:04.869 --> 04:33:04.879 align:start position:0%
any so anyone comes in here at any time
 
04:33:04.879 --> 04:33:06.551 align:start position:0%
any so anyone comes in here at any time
can

04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:33:09.750 --> 04:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
vote if they're in the for more than a
 
04:33:11.949 --> 04:33:11.959 align:start position:0%
an evening is
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
that um what you're that's what you're
 
04:33:17.310 --> 04:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
implying here that's not my intent I
 
04:33:19.189 --> 04:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
know many people believe that that's
 
04:33:21.590 --> 04:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
what even the current law says and what
 
04:33:25.070 --> 04:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
it said before that's simply uh that's
 
04:33:27.070 --> 04:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
simply not true everybody who wants to
 
04:33:29.629 --> 04:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
vote needs uh proof of identity which
 
04:33:31.310 --> 04:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
can include a driver's license proof of
 
04:33:33.830 --> 04:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
residency and also proof of citizenship
 
04:33:35.910 --> 04:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:33:37.949 --> 04:33:37.959 align:start position:0%
if you have those three things here um
 
04:33:40.390 --> 04:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really matter why you lived
 
04:33:42.189 --> 04:33:42.199 align:start position:0%
why you move to the place where you are
 
04:33:45.310 --> 04:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
and um technically I guess if you move
 
04:33:46.949 --> 04:33:46.959 align:start position:0%
here just for a day and then vote and go
 
04:33:48.789 --> 04:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
away that I believe could be a violation
 
04:33:51.670 --> 04:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
of election law but there's a not any
 
04:33:54.590 --> 04:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
evidence of large numbers of people uh
 
04:33:56.189 --> 04:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
large numbers of people doing that even
 
04:33:58.590 --> 04:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
though there's sort of a belief but the
 
04:34:00.990 --> 04:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
evidence you know nobody for example
 
04:34:03.390 --> 04:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
there's a legendary voter buses from
 
04:34:05.150 --> 04:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts no one has actually seen
 
04:34:07.349 --> 04:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
those buses no one has ever infiltrated
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
those buses no one has man to get a
 
04:34:13.150 --> 04:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
picture of them so you wonder like uh I
 
04:34:14.230 --> 04:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
maybe I shouldn't have brought that up
 
04:34:15.429 --> 04:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
that's something I know many people
 
04:34:17.269 --> 04:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
believe is true but there's absolutely
 
04:34:19.029 --> 04:34:19.039 align:start position:0%
no evidence of it in fact people in
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or any other state they
 
04:34:21.429 --> 04:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
want to vote in their own States
 
04:34:22.830 --> 04:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
election they're not really all that
 
04:34:26.750 --> 04:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
concerned with with ours um so um I
 
04:34:28.949 --> 04:34:28.959 align:start position:0%
would just say no anything doesn't go
 
04:34:30.390 --> 04:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
and we're just putting the law the way
 
04:34:32.670 --> 04:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
it was back to 2012 and that law had
 
04:34:34.510 --> 04:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
been in place for a long time and uh you
 
04:34:36.830 --> 04:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
know and anything didn't go back then
 
04:34:39.189 --> 04:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
anything doesn't go now anything isn't
 
04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
going to go um if we pass my bill so
 
04:34:44.551 --> 04:34:44.561 align:start position:0%
that's my answer
 
04:34:46.830 --> 04:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
thanks further questions from the
 
04:34:49.390 --> 04:34:49.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative P Brian thank
 
04:34:51.551 --> 04:34:51.561 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my
 
04:34:54.189 --> 04:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking at page
 
04:34:57.670 --> 04:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
13 for uh registering more than 30 days
 
04:35:00.029 --> 04:35:00.039 align:start position:0%
in advance of an election and it's all
 
04:35:02.510 --> 04:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
struck out so this bill would also
 
04:35:04.310 --> 04:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
remove the requirement that someone
 
04:35:05.830 --> 04:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
would have
 
04:35:08.590 --> 04:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
a driver's license to show their
 
04:35:12.070 --> 04:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
identity uh a government ID with a photo
 
04:35:14.349 --> 04:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
on it to show their identity um a
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
government issued check a benefit
 
04:35:17.869 --> 04:35:17.879 align:start position:0%
statement or tax document to show their
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
identity what would be acceptable to
 
04:35:23.029 --> 04:35:23.039 align:start position:0%
show their identity maybe just a note
 
04:35:26.830 --> 04:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
from someone or um well you um You
 
04:35:28.789 --> 04:35:28.799 align:start position:0%
probably actually does anybody have an
 
04:35:30.750 --> 04:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
extra copy of the bill I think I brought
 
04:35:32.349 --> 04:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
a bunch of paper but not that one see
 
04:35:33.470 --> 04:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're talking about I
 
04:35:33.480 --> 04:35:34.189 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're talking about I
think

04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:35:40.709 --> 04:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:42.869 --> 04:35:42.879 align:start position:0%
them I mean certainly before that you
 
04:35:44.349 --> 04:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
still had to show ID when when
 
04:35:46.230 --> 04:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
registering we did put in a thing we
 
04:35:47.949 --> 04:35:47.959 align:start position:0%
have to show it at the polling place
 
04:35:51.629 --> 04:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
which this does
 
04:35:55.949 --> 04:35:55.959 align:start position:0%
um which this does uh make this would
 
04:35:58.349 --> 04:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
would change so yes see line 13 yes
 
04:36:01.029 --> 04:36:01.039 align:start position:0%
Crossing out uh is crossing a lot of
 
04:36:03.269 --> 04:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
language that was added about uh there's
 
04:36:04.910 --> 04:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
a special procedure currently for if
 
04:36:06.990 --> 04:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
you're 30 days advance of the election
 
04:36:07.000 --> 04:36:08.310 align:start position:0%
you're 30 days advance of the election
but

04:36:08.310 --> 04:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:36:11.349 --> 04:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
I I believe and you may want have a work
 
04:36:12.629 --> 04:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
session or call on the Secretary of
 
04:36:14.709 --> 04:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
State to get the straight answer um of
 
04:36:16.789 --> 04:36:16.799 align:start position:0%
it but this bill has been introduced
 
04:36:20.470 --> 04:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
several times um it would go back to the
 
04:36:22.429 --> 04:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
old form which still required ID and
 
04:36:23.709 --> 04:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
proof do you live there and all that
 
04:36:27.109 --> 04:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
stuff so that's I I I think your I think
 
04:36:28.670 --> 04:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
your fears fears are unfounded you're
 
04:36:31.629 --> 04:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
certainly um certainly welcome to call
 
04:36:32.830 --> 04:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
have a work session and ask the
 
04:36:34.390 --> 04:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State exactly what the
 
04:36:35.789 --> 04:36:35.799 align:start position:0%
current law said says what the current
 
04:36:38.029 --> 04:36:38.039 align:start position:0%
law didn't but that's um that's my
 
04:36:41.709 --> 04:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
answer thanks so it might just
 
04:36:44.310 --> 04:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
understand so this bill when you say
 
04:36:46.949 --> 04:36:46.959 align:start position:0%
show a for of ID you're including in
 
04:36:49.590 --> 04:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
that definition an
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
affidavit just to clarify well there is
 
04:36:53.551 --> 04:36:53.561 align:start position:0%
a procedure for an affidavit for
 
04:36:54.869 --> 04:36:54.879 align:start position:0%
somebody who's missing some of the
 
04:36:57.310 --> 04:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
documentation I think we now recently we
 
04:36:59.990 --> 04:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
put in a provisional ballot the number
 
04:37:02.310 --> 04:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
of those affidavit is pretty pretty
 
04:37:05.109 --> 04:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
small but uh they do include that as a
 
04:37:07.429 --> 04:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
workaround you still you're feeling that
 
04:37:09.390 --> 04:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
under penalty of perjury so you know if
 
04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
you uh you're taking a big risk if you
 
04:37:14.429 --> 04:37:14.439 align:start position:0%
file a false Avid Aid so that's
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
especially since people are uh keeping
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
an eye on it that is something that's a
 
04:37:21.429 --> 04:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
lot of concern about in the public so so
 
04:37:23.230 --> 04:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
followup if I may unless somebody wants
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
to jump in so this would repeal s SP 418
 
04:37:26.400 --> 04:37:28.230 align:start position:0%
to jump in so this would repeal s SP 418
or

04:37:28.230 --> 04:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:37:32.349 --> 04:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
no SP 318 sp3 and hb1 1264 but then it
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
reenacts the previous law which covered
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
um pretty much pretty much the same
 
04:37:40.310 --> 04:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
ground as what those three bills have
 
04:37:42.990 --> 04:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
put in place so yes so we would be going
 
04:37:45.910 --> 04:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
back to a system where you can show up
 
04:37:48.029 --> 04:37:48.039 align:start position:0%
to the voting to the polling location
 
04:37:48.039 --> 04:37:48.949 align:start position:0%
to the voting to the polling location
with

04:37:48.949 --> 04:37:48.959 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:37:51.429 --> 04:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
nothing and be just be handed a ballot
 
04:37:53.150 --> 04:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
or am I just am I off base on this I'm
 
04:37:54.269 --> 04:37:54.279 align:start position:0%
try trying to figure out what this bill
 
04:37:56.310 --> 04:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
does well a little little off base it is
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
theoretically to file um those three
 
04:38:00.629 --> 04:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
requirements if you don't have the
 
04:38:02.629 --> 04:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
paperwork and you're willing to testify
 
04:38:04.670 --> 04:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
so under penalty perjury you you could
 
04:38:06.629 --> 04:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
fill out affidavits if I recall
 
04:38:08.869 --> 04:38:08.879 align:start position:0%
correctly and I don't know about the
 
04:38:10.869 --> 04:38:10.879 align:start position:0%
Comm we have a provisional valid
 
04:38:13.551 --> 04:38:13.561 align:start position:0%
procedure in place which I think exactly
 
04:38:15.310 --> 04:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
I think maybe one person used it in the
 
04:38:17.109 --> 04:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester mayor election so that's it's
 
04:38:19.349 --> 04:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
not not a large number of people even
 
04:38:21.629 --> 04:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
before that who were like going that
 
04:38:23.109 --> 04:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
route so I don't think it's affected any
 
04:38:26.429 --> 04:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
elections so got it okay representative
 
04:38:28.709 --> 04:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you uh and thank you for
 
04:38:31.590 --> 04:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh so under Section 8
 
04:38:35.789 --> 04:38:35.799 align:start position:0%
on page 20 uh it says that the Secretary
 
04:38:37.551 --> 04:38:37.561 align:start position:0%
of State may become a member of a
 
04:38:39.789 --> 04:38:39.799 align:start position:0%
program or organization who is composed
 
04:38:43.750 --> 04:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
of State local uh DC or voting
 
04:38:46.750 --> 04:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
territories uh election officials from
 
04:38:48.349 --> 04:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
the United States whose purpose is to
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
share and exchange information to
 
04:38:52.470 --> 04:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
improve accuracy and efficiency of voter
 
04:38:54.910 --> 04:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
registration system does this mean that
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
you would enable the uh SOS to enroll Us
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
in something like
 
04:38:59.279 --> 04:39:00.869 align:start position:0%
in something like
Eric

04:39:00.869 --> 04:39:00.879 align:start position:0%
Eric
 
04:39:03.590 --> 04:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
I I believe it would you may want to
 
04:39:06.310 --> 04:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a I'm not 100% sure they
 
04:39:07.470 --> 04:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
answer that question it certain be
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them under certain
 
04:39:11.709 --> 04:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances toh to do so and they have
 
04:39:13.869 --> 04:39:13.879 align:start position:0%
in the past it does mention one
 
04:39:16.390 --> 04:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
particular Interstate voter rtion cross
 
04:39:18.990 --> 04:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
check program which was uh that was like
 
04:39:21.269 --> 04:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
several years ago but it that
 
04:39:23.429 --> 04:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
organization made had a lot of problems
 
04:39:23.439 --> 04:39:24.629 align:start position:0%
organization made had a lot of problems
it

04:39:24.629 --> 04:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:39:27.990 --> 04:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
was it was a system for matching the
 
04:39:29.949 --> 04:39:29.959 align:start position:0%
names to names other states was like
 
04:39:31.750 --> 04:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
throwing out huge numbers of false
 
04:39:35.551 --> 04:39:35.561 align:start position:0%
positives and so we are trying to
 
04:39:36.949 --> 04:39:36.959 align:start position:0%
trying to make it unable for them to
 
04:39:38.590 --> 04:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
participate in that one but yeah they
 
04:39:41.110 --> 04:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
can you know I don't think that I think
 
04:39:43.708 --> 04:39:43.718 align:start position:0%
it's think either before right now and
 
04:39:45.310 --> 04:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
after this bill passed I think I believe
 
04:39:46.670 --> 04:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
they'll still be able to participate in
 
04:39:48.150 --> 04:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
such programs and once again you may
 
04:39:50.470 --> 04:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
want to you know may want to take
 
04:39:51.550 --> 04:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
another look at it even though I
 
04:39:53.070 --> 04:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
sponsored this bill several times and
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's been been looked at by OS multiple
 
04:39:56.990 --> 04:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
times and the Secretary of State's
 
04:39:59.670 --> 04:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
office multiple times but yes okay thank
 
04:40:01.310 --> 04:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
 
04:40:01.320 --> 04:40:02.350 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
representative

04:40:02.350 --> 04:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:40:04.948 --> 04:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:40:07.590 --> 04:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative hgan to your knowledge
 
04:40:11.190 --> 04:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
was anyone ever convicted or accused of
 
04:40:13.470 --> 04:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
voter fraud convicted of voter fraud
 
04:40:16.190 --> 04:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
under this law when it existed prior to
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
the numerous
 
04:40:20.430 --> 04:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
changes basically basically no there's a
 
04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
few cases of voter fraud and they're not
 
04:40:25.070 --> 04:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily the type of individual that
 
04:40:26.628 --> 04:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
certain people worry about committing
 
04:40:28.750 --> 04:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
voter fraud who had usually it's
 
04:40:31.150 --> 04:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
somebody who a lot of times ironically
 
04:40:33.670 --> 04:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
they seemen hard a lot of times you see
 
04:40:35.550 --> 04:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
ironically not necessar neily be be
 
04:40:37.390 --> 04:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
Democrats and not necessarily young I
 
04:40:39.910 --> 04:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
mean occasionally somebody will vote in
 
04:40:41.948 --> 04:40:41.958 align:start position:0%
uh Massachusetts for example another
 
04:40:43.390 --> 04:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire but it's a
 
04:40:45.510 --> 04:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
handful of people and the
 
04:40:48.190 --> 04:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
Secretary State and the Attorney General
 
04:40:50.350 --> 04:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
have a robust system in place for trying
 
04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
to catch people to do that and some
 
04:40:53.590 --> 04:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
people actually have been prosecuted but
 
04:40:55.350 --> 04:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
um I don't know it's not hordes of
 
04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
people anyway
 
04:40:59.070 --> 04:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
thanks further questions on the
 
04:41:01.270 --> 04:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
committee all right I will end with this
 
04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
one because it's my favorite question to
 
04:41:05.788 --> 04:41:05.798 align:start position:0%
ask when we get to voter ID
 
04:41:08.230 --> 04:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
if somebody signs an affidavit and you
 
04:41:10.868 --> 04:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
haven't seen their driver's license so
 
04:41:12.990 --> 04:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
you don't know where they live you don't
 
04:41:15.190 --> 04:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
know who they are who they say they are
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
how do you track them down to prosecute
 
04:41:21.230 --> 04:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
them people have been people have been
 
04:41:23.110 --> 04:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
tracked down and prosecuted the driver's
 
04:41:25.110 --> 04:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
license by the way is not a requirement
 
04:41:27.350 --> 04:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
to vote you're nobody's allowed to carry
 
04:41:29.470 --> 04:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
a driver's license although then you
 
04:41:31.788 --> 04:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
lose your and that's primarily designed
 
04:41:33.310 --> 04:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
to show that you're qualified to operate
 
04:41:35.708 --> 04:41:35.718 align:start position:0%
a motor vehicles it's not and it's not
 
04:41:39.310 --> 04:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
really um a proof of address and I think
 
04:41:41.590 --> 04:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
hardly maybe a few people believe it's a
 
04:41:43.670 --> 04:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship but it's not that
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
either so that's uh you know the the
 
04:41:48.590 --> 04:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
actual who signs out the affidavit and
 
04:41:50.430 --> 04:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
what happens to is a matter of public
 
04:41:52.350 --> 04:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
record and it's a very manageable number
 
04:41:55.150 --> 04:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
of people so they uh you know so that's
 
04:41:56.430 --> 04:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
that's my answer there we're kind of
 
04:41:59.470 --> 04:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
like a this is um I think these laws
 
04:42:00.990 --> 04:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
were a passw where the usually old
 
04:42:02.788 --> 04:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
cliche we have here they were Solutions
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
in search of a problem but
 
04:42:07.350 --> 04:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh with that seeing no other
 
04:42:08.550 --> 04:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Horan
 
04:42:10.788 --> 04:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
I don't have anyone else signed up to
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill um so can you I
 
04:42:16.190 --> 04:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
didn't look online yet that's my
 
04:42:18.750 --> 04:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
apologies can you guys pass me the blue
 
04:42:20.110 --> 04:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
sheet and I
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
was reading chapter l so I don't have my
 
04:42:25.670 --> 04:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
phone on the right screen
 
04:42:28.910 --> 04:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
1140 nobody 11 okay uh there's no one
 
04:42:32.670 --> 04:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
one one again and oh yep uh one person
 
04:42:34.868 --> 04:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
signed up who didn't speak and they were
 
04:42:37.150 --> 04:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
and that was the Secretary of State's
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
office um so uh and let me get the
 
04:42:43.990 --> 04:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
online here why it would help if I could
 
04:42:46.390 --> 04:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
count all right here we go all right
 
04:42:49.470 --> 04:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
11:49 we had 20 signed up in support 60
 
04:42:51.788 --> 04:42:51.798 align:start position:0%
in opposition Zer neutral and with that
 
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
I will close the public hearing on House
 
04:42:54.120 --> 04:42:55.270 align:start position:0%
I will close the public hearing on House
Bill

04:42:55.270 --> 04:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:42:57.708 --> 04:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
1149 and the committee will stand in
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:03.480 --> 04:50:54.548 align:start position:0%
 
150

04:50:54.548 --> 04:50:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:58.628 --> 04:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
okay it's 150 means we're back going to
 
04:51:02.190 --> 04:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
open up the public hearing on House Bill
 
04:51:05.868 --> 04:51:05.878 align:start position:0%
1348 relative to polling places at which
 
04:51:07.990 --> 04:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
total ballot counts exceed the total
 
04:51:09.868 --> 04:51:09.878 align:start position:0%
number of registered voters uh
 
04:51:10.910 --> 04:51:10.920 align:start position:0%

04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
a uh celebrity chair of
 
04:51:20.910 --> 04:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
Finance the committee that no one in
 
04:51:22.070 --> 04:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
this room will ever be good enough to be
 
04:51:22.080 --> 04:51:23.708 align:start position:0%
this room will ever be good enough to be
on

04:51:23.708 --> 04:51:23.718 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:51:29.350 --> 04:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.150 --> 04:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
me it's the best Committee in the house

God bless God bless anybody who wants
 
04:51:34.910 --> 04:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
wants to sit on
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
finance get to hear everything but then
 
04:51:38.270 --> 04:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
again they probably say that about
 
04:51:40.910 --> 04:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
election law so or they don't
 
04:51:40.920 --> 04:51:45.788 align:start position:0%
election law so or they don't
representative

04:51:45.788 --> 04:51:45.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:48.070 --> 04:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
wer can can you hit your microphone for
 
04:51:51.350 --> 04:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
me see we in election law we use the
 
04:51:53.910 --> 04:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
microphon that's a good idea see it's I
 
04:51:54.948 --> 04:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
I went both directions so now
 
04:51:56.510 --> 04:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's happy right now we're all

okay
[Music]

04:52:06.110 --> 04:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:52:07.868 --> 04:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
congratulations with all the bills you
 
04:52:12.628 --> 04:52:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:14.548 --> 04:52:14.558 align:start position:0%
time very
 
04:52:18.070 --> 04:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
good so 10 years ago the secretary of
 
04:52:19.990 --> 04:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
state would declare a good turnout for
 
04:52:21.708 --> 04:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
presidential election if the
 
04:52:23.430 --> 04:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
participation was
 
04:52:26.510 --> 04:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
50% in 2016 the legislature ordered the
 
04:52:28.470 --> 04:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to write letters to
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
all the same day registrants in that
 
04:52:32.430 --> 04:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
election we were get letting them get
 
04:52:35.150 --> 04:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
away with affidavits that year he was
 
04:52:37.510 --> 04:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat selective in whom he mailed to
 
04:52:41.310 --> 04:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
but over 8,000 letters were sent out 5
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
5,300 came back as
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
undeliverable no such person at that
 
04:52:49.590 --> 04:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
address the results of the 2016 election
 
04:52:51.910 --> 04:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
was somewhat surprising the Republicans
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
had a 220 to 170 majority in the house
 
04:52:57.270 --> 04:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
the Senate was 14 to10
 
04:52:59.948 --> 04:52:59.958 align:start position:0%
Republicans however both Congress people
 
04:53:01.470 --> 04:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
and the Senate went
 
04:53:03.670 --> 04:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
Democrat one might conclude that the
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
5,300 fake votes were all for Democrats
 
04:53:08.150 --> 04:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
and the illegal voters only did the top
 
04:53:09.788 --> 04:53:09.798 align:start position:0%
of the ballot so they could hurry to the
 
04:53:12.390 --> 04:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
next polling place and fill out more
 
04:53:14.948 --> 04:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
affidavits that was my conclusion when I
 
04:53:17.510 --> 04:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
would go in to warm up at my polling
 
04:53:19.628 --> 04:53:19.638 align:start position:0%
place and the the seven or eight seats
 
04:53:21.270 --> 04:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
at the table for affidavits always
 
04:53:23.150 --> 04:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
filled somebody would finish the
 
04:53:24.590 --> 04:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
paperwork they get up another person
 
04:53:27.670 --> 04:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
would sit down and fill out paperwork in
 
04:53:30.628 --> 04:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
my little place of couple of thou of
 
04:53:33.150 --> 04:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
couple thousand voters there must have
 
04:53:33.160 --> 04:53:34.708 align:start position:0%
couple thousand voters there must have
been

04:53:34.708 --> 04:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:53:38.350 --> 04:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:40.948 --> 04:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
affidavits I found some election results
 
04:53:43.590 --> 04:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
some election audits that an auditor did
 
04:53:46.948 --> 04:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
for the 2022 election normally we see a
 
04:53:48.910 --> 04:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
lower turnout in a midterm election she
 
04:53:50.788 --> 04:53:50.798 align:start position:0%
states that New Hampshire had a close to
 
04:53:54.750 --> 04:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
90% turnout for the 2022 election and
 
04:53:57.830 --> 04:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
due to same day registrations she finds
 
04:54:00.430 --> 04:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
22 polling places where the numbers
 
04:54:00.440 --> 04:54:02.470 align:start position:0%
22 polling places where the numbers
exceeded

04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
exceeded
 
04:54:04.708 --> 04:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
100% I'm convinced that we are still
 
04:54:06.390 --> 04:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
seeing a massive cheating in our
 
04:54:08.070 --> 04:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
elections and the results would seem to
 
04:54:10.548 --> 04:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
indicate that it is a democratic funded
 
04:54:12.830 --> 04:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
Affair a few years ago a package from
 
04:54:14.350 --> 04:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
China broke open while it was being
 
04:54:16.670 --> 04:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
unloaded at O'Hare Airport the picture
 
04:54:19.548 --> 04:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
showed many fake driver's license we
 
04:54:21.270 --> 04:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
need far more efforts to stop this
 
04:54:23.590 --> 04:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
illegal voting in our state this bill is
 
04:54:26.670 --> 04:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
only one small step I'm hopeful that
 
04:54:28.350 --> 04:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
this committee will see the need to pass
 
04:54:31.350 --> 04:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
it in the 2020 election some secretaries
 
04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
of State Certified election where the
 
04:54:36.990 --> 04:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
ballots outnumbered the population we
 
04:54:39.470 --> 04:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
need to give our secretary this tool and
 
04:54:42.310 --> 04:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
I'll on the back side of my piece I show
 
04:54:45.150 --> 04:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
you how much information we know about
 
04:54:47.990 --> 04:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
the voting age population and this is
 
04:54:51.548 --> 04:54:51.558 align:start position:0%
available by town and City so that they
 
04:54:53.948 --> 04:54:53.958 align:start position:0%
should be able to know how many people
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
there are in that town that are over
 
04:55:00.750 --> 04:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
18 and that should be the N the maximum
 
04:55:01.708 --> 04:55:01.718 align:start position:0%
number of
 
04:55:06.910 --> 04:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
votes and I recall uh counties in
 
04:55:10.150 --> 04:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
Michigan where the ballots vastly
 
04:55:12.270 --> 04:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
outnumbered the total population and yet
 
04:55:15.070 --> 04:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
it was certified so this is the sort of
 
04:55:17.150 --> 04:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
thing if our secretary of state has a
 
04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
law that says I can't certify this
 
04:55:20.868 --> 04:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
04:55:23.708 --> 04:55:23.718 align:start position:0%
because the the ballots
 
04:55:26.910 --> 04:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
outnumber the residents or outnumber the
 
04:55:29.350 --> 04:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
voting residents so that's that's my
 
04:55:31.628 --> 04:55:31.638 align:start position:0%
attempt to try to stifle some of this
 
04:55:34.868 --> 04:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
cheating that goes on and this uh 2022
 
04:55:36.750 --> 04:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
election she did find several places
 
04:55:39.430 --> 04:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
where they brought in bunches of people
 
04:55:42.548 --> 04:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
to go sign up to vote that day more than
 
04:55:45.670 --> 04:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
they should have been by the numbers of
 
04:55:47.390 --> 04:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
registered voters even including the
 
04:55:49.390 --> 04:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
ones registering that day happy to
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you okay
 
04:55:52.470 --> 04:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:55:55.350 --> 04:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none representative
 
04:55:57.948 --> 04:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
bom's not going to let you get away that
 
04:56:01.030 --> 04:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
easy question
 
04:56:05.548 --> 04:56:05.558 align:start position:0%
um so what about I'm my issue on this
 
04:56:08.470 --> 04:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
is there are people that legally
 
04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
voted so what do we do to fix that their
 
04:56:14.788 --> 04:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
vote shouldn't be negated uh should we
 
04:56:19.230 --> 04:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
have a another election I mean just say
 
04:56:24.270 --> 04:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
that um that those votes don't count so
 
04:56:27.548 --> 04:56:27.558 align:start position:0%
how do you think we should fix it what
 
04:56:30.628 --> 04:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
else can you do if if somebody comes in
 
04:56:33.670 --> 04:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
and dumps a bunch of phony ballots
 
04:56:35.310 --> 04:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
they've been the ones that destroyed the
 
04:56:37.750 --> 04:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
election in that polling place not the
 
04:56:40.150 --> 04:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
not the legitimate voters what else can
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
we do but say we can't count this it's
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
been flawed yeah and also you mentioned
 
04:56:48.910 --> 04:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you uh I remember some
 
04:56:51.670 --> 04:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
years ago in Kings County Seattle
 
04:56:53.590 --> 04:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
Washington where the governor's race and
 
04:56:55.990 --> 04:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
they kept recounting the ballots over
 
04:56:57.788 --> 04:56:57.798 align:start position:0%
and over again then even after the
 
04:57:00.510 --> 04:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
ballots were counted they and they took
 
04:57:02.350 --> 04:57:02.360 align:start position:0%
it to court and the judge ruled it out
 
04:57:04.230 --> 04:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
because even know it proved that in
 
04:57:06.868 --> 04:57:06.878 align:start position:0%
King's County they had 10% more votes
 
04:57:09.670 --> 04:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
than residents in King County so I mean
 
04:57:13.708 --> 04:57:13.718 align:start position:0%
but what you know and it was
 
04:57:15.990 --> 04:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
certified I I assume this is a would you
 
04:57:19.350 --> 04:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
believe yeah but thing all right sorry
 
04:57:22.430 --> 04:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
problem is what I think we still need to
 
04:57:25.788 --> 04:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
do something like it's terrible to
 
04:57:29.910 --> 04:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
negate a legitimate vote right but the
 
04:57:32.548 --> 04:57:32.558 align:start position:0%
the it was negated by the Crooked people
 
04:57:34.430 --> 04:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
that that
 
04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:42.150 --> 04:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
voters representative wood thank you Mr
 
04:57:44.510 --> 04:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:57:45.990 --> 04:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh I noed a couple of things here in
 
04:57:49.270 --> 04:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
item six 90% turnout what's a typical
 
04:57:52.510 --> 04:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
turnout do do you how we compare that to
 
04:57:54.190 --> 04:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
typical turnout in
 
04:57:56.868 --> 04:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
2022 do you have information on that I'm
 
04:58:00.510 --> 04:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
not even talking about the 100% the 2022
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
had had an average of 90% so all of it
 
04:58:05.910 --> 04:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
was at average a 90% so average all of
 
04:58:08.788 --> 04:58:08.798 align:start position:0%
it average 90% but 22 polling places out
 
04:58:12.430 --> 04:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
of the hundreds had more than 100% yeah
 
04:58:14.230 --> 04:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm one of those people that like oh
 
04:58:17.470 --> 04:58:17.480 align:start position:0%
can I have a follow sorry I was having a
 
04:58:19.830 --> 04:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
must I fell asleep I was having no I was
 
04:58:22.548 --> 04:58:22.558 align:start position:0%
having a um a voter age participation
 
04:58:25.510 --> 04:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
VAP flashback okay um my mind was
 
04:58:27.230 --> 04:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
wandering go ahead thank thank you Mr
 
04:58:31.470 --> 04:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
chair uh the 90% I find high I I'm one
 
04:58:32.788 --> 04:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
of the people that like to play with
 
04:58:35.948 --> 04:58:35.958 align:start position:0%
numbers that we we hear about in this
 
04:58:40.110 --> 04:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
this group I find a 90% high so how what
 
04:58:43.670 --> 04:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
answer did you get for 100% I mean that
 
04:58:46.190 --> 04:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm sure you got this information
 
04:58:47.830 --> 04:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
you you you talked to SEC have you
 
04:58:49.830 --> 04:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
talked to the Secretary of State what's
 
04:58:52.030 --> 04:58:52.040 align:start position:0%
his answer to this I I've talked with
 
04:58:53.628 --> 04:58:53.638 align:start position:0%
with his people that investigate this
 
04:58:55.110 --> 04:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
sort of thing and they claim it's very
 
04:58:58.350 --> 04:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
low now since 2016 because they didn't
 
04:59:01.990 --> 04:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
allow for the affidavits but when I know
 
04:59:07.150 --> 04:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
there's phony I out there then the the
 
04:59:10.190 --> 04:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
amount of numbers that this auditor
 
04:59:15.230 --> 04:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
showed um that were coming out typically
 
04:59:18.510 --> 04:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
there was 20 to 25 to 30% same day
 
04:59:20.430 --> 04:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
registrant which I think we would all
 
04:59:22.830 --> 04:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
find somewhat
 
04:59:25.590 --> 04:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
surprising but especially a midterm
 
04:59:29.190 --> 04:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
election yeah I I will regret this but
 
04:59:31.190 --> 04:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative Mirad is
 
04:59:33.590 --> 04:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
recognized it's a simple point point of
 
04:59:35.430 --> 04:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you Mr chair thank
 
04:59:37.750 --> 04:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question are are you
 
04:59:40.830 --> 04:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
saying that the average turnout in the
 
04:59:42.948 --> 04:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire in the 2022
 
04:59:45.350 --> 04:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
election was 90% that's what this
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
auditor said over the whole state over
 
04:59:50.750 --> 04:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
the whole state thank you which is you
 
04:59:53.750 --> 04:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
know I remember when uh Sumit election
 
04:59:56.310 --> 04:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
oh we had a big turnout
 
04:59:58.910 --> 04:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
53% and that I remember that for years
 
05:00:00.310 --> 05:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
and years that's what they would say oh
 
05:00:02.548 --> 05:00:02.558 align:start position:0%
big turnout 50 50 some per. uh we
 
05:00:03.868 --> 05:00:03.878 align:start position:0%
actually representative Brennan she had
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
her hand up unless she wishes to
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
yield represent yes um do you know since
 
05:00:12.030 --> 05:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
you've been looking at these numbers
 
05:00:14.990 --> 05:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
what was a typical uh 2022 election turn
 
05:00:18.030 --> 05:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
out say for for the for all the states
 
05:00:20.670 --> 05:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
do you have that information I I didn't
 
05:00:22.510 --> 05:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't research that okay just as a
 
05:00:24.628 --> 05:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
point of clarification the secretary of
 
05:00:25.750 --> 05:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
state does actually have that report
 
05:00:27.310 --> 05:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
online if anybody wishes to go look at
 
05:00:28.910 --> 05:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
it it's quite fascinating New
 
05:00:31.030 --> 05:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's always in the top
 
05:00:33.830 --> 05:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
three representative Hamlet
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative ham
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative I apologize I'm going to
 
05:00:38.868 --> 05:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
your colleag representative Brennan
 
05:00:41.708 --> 05:00:41.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:00:44.750 --> 05:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
um representative Wier thank you for
 
05:00:48.270 --> 05:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
being here um I'm seeing a number of
 
05:00:50.830 --> 05:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
claims in your testimony and I'm hearing
 
05:00:52.910 --> 05:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
a number of claims in your testimony and
 
05:00:54.948 --> 05:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you might be able to
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
site your sources so that I can do some
 
05:00:57.840 --> 05:00:59.910 align:start position:0%
site your sources so that I can do some
follow-up

05:00:59.910 --> 05:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:01:04.750 --> 05:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
research I think the uh the auditor
 
05:01:07.430 --> 05:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I should have written her name down
 
05:01:09.310 --> 05:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
had so many names in my mind lately but
 
05:01:12.190 --> 05:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
anyway I think it's on voter integrity
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
and she's got the figures from 2022
 
05:01:16.868 --> 05:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
she's a person that was arrested so
 
05:01:20.430 --> 05:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
often in in the uh Nashwood Town Hall
 
05:01:23.230 --> 05:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
she moved out of the state every
 
05:01:27.708 --> 05:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:30.670 --> 05:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
much okay um any other questions
 
05:01:33.030 --> 05:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlet thank you Mr Mr
 
05:01:35.350 --> 05:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:01:38.510 --> 05:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
question so could you just please
 
05:01:40.470 --> 05:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
explain the the graph that you have on
 
05:01:44.070 --> 05:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
the backs side of the page yes what U
 
05:01:47.230 --> 05:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
what do those percentages stand
 
05:01:49.750 --> 05:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
for basically what I wanted to show when
 
05:01:51.548 --> 05:01:51.558 align:start position:0%
somebody say well how are we know that
 
05:01:54.270 --> 05:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
the Voting is more than 100% well we
 
05:01:56.430 --> 05:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
have all the census data and it goes by
 
05:01:58.948 --> 05:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
towns and it goes by cities and it tells
 
05:02:00.868 --> 05:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
us right there citizens 18 years and
 
05:02:03.110 --> 05:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
over and that's will be in every s
 
05:02:06.910 --> 05:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
report so that would be basically the
 
05:02:09.628 --> 05:02:09.638 align:start position:0%
100% if everybody that was in that town
 
05:02:12.910 --> 05:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
that was over 18 voted that would be
 
05:02:15.750 --> 05:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
100% if the number exceeded
 
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
that then we have a few
 
05:02:23.430 --> 05:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
phonies further questions represent oh
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
sorry yield represent Hamlet which qu
 
05:02:28.990 --> 05:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
okay president of thank you for taking
 
05:02:32.030 --> 05:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
my followup so but these percentages are
 
05:02:35.548 --> 05:02:35.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:39.470 --> 05:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
100% no no the important one is Citizens
 
05:02:42.430 --> 05:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
18 years and over a million
 
05:02:46.910 --> 05:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
35684 out of 3 something million 3.1
 
05:02:49.470 --> 05:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
million I think we have in the state so
 
05:02:54.548 --> 05:02:54.558 align:start position:0%
only 1,35 6684 are above the age of 18
 
05:02:56.150 --> 05:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
now if you went and did this town by
 
05:02:58.190 --> 05:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
town you would have the number in your
 
05:03:00.548 --> 05:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
town that were in the census that were
 
05:03:00.558 --> 05:03:01.670 align:start position:0%
town that were in the census that were
over

05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:03:05.948 --> 05:03:05.958 align:start position:0%
18 okay if that number was
 
05:03:08.910 --> 05:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
286 and you've got 300
 
05:03:11.628 --> 05:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
ballots that would be questionable
 
05:03:14.990 --> 05:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
you're having over 100% voting so you
 
05:03:16.548 --> 05:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
would look at the census numers that
 
05:03:18.390 --> 05:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
should be in your town and it would be
 
05:03:22.470 --> 05:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
very unusual to even make 100% but to
 
05:03:27.868 --> 05:03:27.878 align:start position:0%
exceed 100% And with the number of in in
 
05:03:27.878 --> 05:03:29.510 align:start position:0%
exceed 100% And with the number of in in
Elizabeth

05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth
 
05:03:34.670 --> 05:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
Todd's voting that were typically 25 to
 
05:03:37.628 --> 05:03:37.638 align:start position:0%
30% same day
 
05:03:40.430 --> 05:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
registrant which usually is highly
 
05:03:42.150 --> 05:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
speculative those are the ones that in
 
05:03:45.628 --> 05:03:45.638 align:start position:0%
2016 filled out affidavits and then when
 
05:03:48.270 --> 05:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
they wrote a letter to that address no
 
05:03:48.280 --> 05:03:49.350 align:start position:0%
they wrote a letter to that address no
one

05:03:49.350 --> 05:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:03:54.030 --> 05:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
there so okay representative
 
05:03:56.788 --> 05:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
L go representative qua that's right
 
05:03:59.750 --> 05:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm getting my it's getting late
 
05:04:01.788 --> 05:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
05:04:04.230 --> 05:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative I have
 
05:04:06.670 --> 05:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
a question that relates to the wording
 
05:04:10.670 --> 05:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
in the bill itself and it's on line
 
05:04:14.470 --> 05:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
three that first sentence that starts in
 
05:04:16.310 --> 05:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
any polling place with the moderator
 
05:04:18.868 --> 05:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
reports a total ballot I'm reading that
 
05:04:20.628 --> 05:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
sentence I'm not sure if I'm having a
 
05:04:22.590 --> 05:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
reading comprehension problem or maybe
 
05:04:25.270 --> 05:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's a word that doesn't belong there
 
05:04:26.910 --> 05:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
in any polling place with the moderator
 
05:04:28.350 --> 05:04:28.360 align:start position:0%
reports a total ballot count which
 
05:04:30.270 --> 05:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
exceeds the number of registered
 
05:04:33.628 --> 05:04:33.638 align:start position:0%
voters Etc including voters shall have
 
05:04:36.190 --> 05:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
the election result negated does the
 
05:04:37.750 --> 05:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
word in at the beginning of that
 
05:04:39.868 --> 05:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
sentence maybe not belong there am I
 
05:04:43.590 --> 05:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
what am I missing there am I am I just
 
05:04:45.470 --> 05:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
reading that wrong well the negation of
 
05:04:47.548 --> 05:04:47.558 align:start position:0%
election is the is the label of that
 
05:04:49.430 --> 05:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
section of the law that would be added
 
05:04:52.110 --> 05:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
but what is shall have what shall have
 
05:04:54.750 --> 05:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
the election result negated I don't see
 
05:04:56.390 --> 05:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
a subject for that sentence it's been a
 
05:04:57.910 --> 05:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
long time since I diagrammed the
 
05:05:01.470 --> 05:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:04.510 --> 05:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
moderator where the moderator reports a
 
05:05:07.030 --> 05:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
total ballot
 
05:05:10.430 --> 05:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
count perhaps it's not the best
 
05:05:12.430 --> 05:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
grammar am
 
05:05:14.590 --> 05:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
I all right well that was my question I
 
05:05:15.830 --> 05:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
mean I don't need it answered right this
 
05:05:18.310 --> 05:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
minute yeah I can see where it's a
 
05:05:20.788 --> 05:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
little confusing who would negate it
 
05:05:23.310 --> 05:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
right who that's that's the vital thing
 
05:05:24.990 --> 05:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
and I I kind of leave this to the
 
05:05:27.390 --> 05:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and and try to
 
05:05:30.510 --> 05:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
empower him and have him looking at wow
 
05:05:32.590 --> 05:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty high turnout not not
 
05:05:34.270 --> 05:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
only that it was more than there were
 
05:05:35.948 --> 05:05:35.958 align:start position:0%
people in the town well I understand
 
05:05:38.150 --> 05:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
your your argument I just really being
 
05:05:41.310 --> 05:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
fussy about that sentence and I'm not
 
05:05:43.510 --> 05:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
sure it makes perfect sense as written
 
05:05:45.390 --> 05:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
it's in your hands you'll have to excuse
 
05:05:47.310 --> 05:05:47.320 align:start position:0%
the representative he's an engineer and
 
05:05:50.110 --> 05:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
these things matter well they they do
 
05:05:52.110 --> 05:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
matter they do matter of course they do
 
05:05:55.670 --> 05:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
you that's why I love you um don't put
 
05:05:55.680 --> 05:05:56.510 align:start position:0%
you that's why I love you um don't put
down

05:05:56.510 --> 05:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
down
 
05:05:59.910 --> 05:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
Engineers are you an engineer MIT oh
 
05:06:02.868 --> 05:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
Lord um we'll have last question from
 
05:06:04.788 --> 05:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
representative Lane he he knows better
 
05:06:06.110 --> 05:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
than just to admit
 
05:06:09.868 --> 05:06:09.878 align:start position:0%
it hand up too but um thank you Mr chair
 
05:06:12.830 --> 05:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
um so I have a couple questions so there
 
05:06:17.150 --> 05:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
may be a few follow-ups sorry um so this
 
05:06:20.030 --> 05:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
information here is from a census is
 
05:06:21.750 --> 05:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
that correct that's correct and the
 
05:06:25.070 --> 05:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
census is done every 10 years correct
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
usually now they they even update it
 
05:06:28.080 --> 05:06:30.030 align:start position:0%
usually now they they even update it
fairly

05:06:30.030 --> 05:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
05:06:33.390 --> 05:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
regularly I think this one even had
 
05:06:37.830 --> 05:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay see it has down there 2015 correct
 
05:06:41.990 --> 05:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
so okay so if you're using that for now
 
05:06:46.150 --> 05:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
or even the 2020 number for now aren't
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:51.830 --> 05:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
disparities I would look for the latest
 
05:06:55.750 --> 05:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
one and I think I think even the um one
 
05:06:58.470 --> 05:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
of the Departments of the State updates
 
05:07:00.150 --> 05:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
I know when I've working with the latest
 
05:07:01.670 --> 05:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
numbers sometimes they bring me an
 
05:07:03.110 --> 05:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
updated number
 
05:07:05.350 --> 05:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
from uh either the administrative
 
05:07:07.110 --> 05:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
Services as one of the other departments
 
05:07:10.230 --> 05:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
in the state that do update um some of
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
the ones that are dependent on a
 
05:07:15.230 --> 05:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
population a lawyer and an
 
05:07:19.030 --> 05:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
engineer so you're so so you are willing
 
05:07:21.190 --> 05:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
to take the vote away from an entire
 
05:07:24.030 --> 05:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
Ward or town of people because the
 
05:07:26.350 --> 05:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
numbers that we've gotten from a state
 
05:07:27.868 --> 05:07:27.878 align:start position:0%
agency whether or not they've been
 
05:07:31.190 --> 05:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
updated I don't know may be incorrect or
 
05:07:32.670 --> 05:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
maybe people have moved into into the
 
05:07:35.150 --> 05:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
town since those numbers have
 
05:07:37.590 --> 05:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
been this will send a message to those
 
05:07:40.670 --> 05:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
that pack us with phonies on the day of
 
05:07:42.670 --> 05:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
registration that you're likely to have
 
05:07:45.030 --> 05:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
it all negated I'm I'm I'm going to
 
05:07:47.270 --> 05:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
offer some clarification here the bill
 
05:07:49.070 --> 05:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
at no point references the census
 
05:07:51.030 --> 05:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
numbers just so we're all on the same
 
05:07:53.150 --> 05:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
page what the bill says because I think
 
05:07:54.868 --> 05:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
we're getting off track and I'm going to
 
05:07:56.750 --> 05:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
excuse representative wer after this but
 
05:07:58.510 --> 05:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
so we're on the same page what the bill
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
does as read is it says if the total
 
05:08:03.830 --> 05:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
number of votes I'm assuming cast is
 
05:08:05.830 --> 05:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
larger than the total number of
 
05:08:08.030 --> 05:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
registered voters including those that
 
05:08:10.390 --> 05:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
registered on Election Day so if there
 
05:08:13.230 --> 05:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
are more votes cast than there are
 
05:08:16.270 --> 05:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
voters on the roles after same day
 
05:08:18.230 --> 05:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
registration then the election is
 
05:08:19.708 --> 05:08:19.718 align:start position:0%
negated I know we're talking a lot about
 
05:08:22.190 --> 05:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
these census numbers but no nowhere does
 
05:08:24.310 --> 05:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
the bill does the word census appear in
 
05:08:27.230 --> 05:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
the bill the bill says registered voters
 
05:08:28.670 --> 05:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
including those that registered on
 
05:08:30.910 --> 05:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
Election Day so we're talking about an
 
05:08:34.190 --> 05:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
election in which more ballots are cast
 
05:08:36.788 --> 05:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
than there are registered voters a
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
including those who registered on
 
05:08:40.070 --> 05:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
Election Day so with that I'm going to
 
05:08:42.070 --> 05:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
let representative Wier go back to the
 
05:08:45.708 --> 05:08:45.718 align:start position:0%
golden Halls of Finance um that'll be my
 
05:08:49.910 --> 05:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
last C that I will yes we have one more
 
05:08:52.868 --> 05:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:57.070 --> 05:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you uh isn't the process of
 
05:08:59.350 --> 05:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
a recount going to give us more
 
05:09:00.750 --> 05:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
information about what happened if
 
05:09:02.868 --> 05:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
there's a transposition
 
05:09:06.910 --> 05:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
error or some other unusual situation
 
05:09:10.750 --> 05:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
like say what happened in Windham we
 
05:09:13.270 --> 05:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
find out more when we have a recount and
 
05:09:15.510 --> 05:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
then we can fix those problems this
 
05:09:17.708 --> 05:09:17.718 align:start position:0%
would keep us from being able to do that
 
05:09:21.190 --> 05:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
right that's my concern well I mean
 
05:09:22.830 --> 05:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
you'd start off with
 
05:09:25.750 --> 05:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
saying we have
 
05:09:29.230 --> 05:09:29.240 align:start position:0%
235 registered voters we have 250
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
ballots how could that
 
05:09:31.120 --> 05:09:33.670 align:start position:0%
ballots how could that
be

05:09:33.670 --> 05:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:09:36.788 --> 05:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
and you know even if you did a recount
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:43.150 --> 05:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
235 then you would it might be worth it
 
05:09:45.310 --> 05:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
to do that if you say we somehow we get
 
05:09:48.230 --> 05:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
double counted
 
05:09:50.628 --> 05:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
somewhere thank you representative wer
 
05:09:52.708 --> 05:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
uh next up will be deputy secretary of
 
05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:01.040 --> 05:10:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
Hennessy

05:10:07.030 --> 05:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Aaron Hennessy
 
05:10:10.670 --> 05:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
I'm the deputy secretary of state and
 
05:10:12.270 --> 05:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of the Secretary of
 
05:10:12.280 --> 05:10:13.350 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of the Secretary of
State's

05:10:13.350 --> 05:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
State's
 
05:10:16.430 --> 05:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
office um I have a few comments on this
 
05:10:19.548 --> 05:10:19.558 align:start position:0%
bill one um I would like the
 
05:10:22.830 --> 05:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
clarification on the wording it
 
05:10:24.750 --> 05:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
currently says at any polling place
 
05:10:26.590 --> 05:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
where the moderator reports a total
 
05:10:29.708 --> 05:10:29.718 align:start position:0%
ballot count um earlier today we had a
 
05:10:33.150 --> 05:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
bill about um that um talked about our
 
05:10:36.270 --> 05:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
ballot inventories and at the end of
 
05:10:39.910 --> 05:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
most every uh polling location the count
 
05:10:43.310 --> 05:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
of the ballots will exceed by far the
 
05:10:47.470 --> 05:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
number of of Voters checking in or some
 
05:10:49.990 --> 05:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
of all votes at that polling location so
 
05:10:52.948 --> 05:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
if the intent is for cast ballots I
 
05:10:54.628 --> 05:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
would like that clarified versus the
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
count of the ballots because the
 
05:10:59.708 --> 05:10:59.718 align:start position:0%
moderator does have to report the count
 
05:11:03.310 --> 05:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
of the ballots um according to 658 31
 
05:11:07.470 --> 05:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
and 32 um the casting of the ballots the
 
05:11:09.310 --> 05:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
cast ballot information is on different
 
05:11:11.628 --> 05:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
forms so we would like a clarification
 
05:11:13.670 --> 05:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
on what form this information would be
 
05:11:15.310 --> 05:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
on whether it be the moderator
 
05:11:18.670 --> 05:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
certificate the monitor's work sheet um
 
05:11:22.990 --> 05:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
or some new form um I I do have similar
 
05:11:26.708 --> 05:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
fears uh that were also um echoed in
 
05:11:29.548 --> 05:11:29.558 align:start position:0%
this by committee members that um this
 
05:11:32.628 --> 05:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
would disenfranchise voters um we have
 
05:11:35.910 --> 05:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
308 polling locations in the state that
 
05:11:38.548 --> 05:11:38.558 align:start position:0%
means that we have 308 different
 
05:11:41.830 --> 05:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
moderators um and clerks and supervisors
 
05:11:44.670 --> 05:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
of the checklists um that all work as a
 
05:11:47.310 --> 05:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
team uh along with ballot clerks um
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
filling out forms um giving us
 
05:11:53.350 --> 05:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
information and we always have a form
 
05:11:57.628 --> 05:11:57.638 align:start position:0%
that has um incorrect information un
 
05:12:00.030 --> 05:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
unintentionally um where they've written
 
05:12:02.350 --> 05:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
the number backwards or they' added an
 
05:12:06.150 --> 05:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
extra zero um and this um this bill
 
05:12:08.590 --> 05:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't give any option for our office
 
05:12:11.510 --> 05:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
to reach out to that polling location to
 
05:12:14.350 --> 05:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
um fix any errors that were made
 
05:12:16.590 --> 05:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
unintentionally okay and I assume you'll
 
05:12:18.750 --> 05:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
be taking questions I'm happy to take
 
05:12:20.150 --> 05:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
questions okay are there questions on
 
05:12:21.830 --> 05:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
05:12:26.270 --> 05:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
Bay thank you Mr chair so if uh there's
 
05:12:29.510 --> 05:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
after the paperwork submitted to you and
 
05:12:32.110 --> 05:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
there are more uh votes cast than than
 
05:12:35.190 --> 05:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
the registered voters plus same day
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
registration is there a procedure a
 
05:12:41.110 --> 05:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
written procedure as far as what
 
05:12:43.350 --> 05:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
happens thank you for the question um
 
05:12:46.230 --> 05:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
currently there's no no procedure in law
 
05:12:49.750 --> 05:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
to find out to do anything with that um
 
05:12:52.990 --> 05:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
what our office did recently um was
 
05:12:55.430 --> 05:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
reviewed all the return information and
 
05:12:58.868 --> 05:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
tried to follow up with the um polling
 
05:13:01.390 --> 05:13:01.400 align:start position:0%

location moderator to find out um ask
questions

05:13:02.270 --> 05:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:13:04.030 --> 05:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
um most of the questions that we asked
 
05:13:06.670 --> 05:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
had to do with ballots cast versus some
 
05:13:09.230 --> 05:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
of all votes and uh the issue I talked
 
05:13:12.230 --> 05:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
about earlier where the undervotes may
 
05:13:14.070 --> 05:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
have been overstated because they were
 
05:13:16.230 --> 05:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
turned into right-in votes but were
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
never um reconciled that way you didn't
 
05:13:22.150 --> 05:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
take away an undervote for the new right
 
05:13:24.510 --> 05:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
in vote that you've discovered um so the
 
05:13:26.470 --> 05:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
sum of all votes would be more than the
 
05:13:29.430 --> 05:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
ballots cast in that instance um
 
05:13:30.948 --> 05:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
sometimes the moderators were able to
 
05:13:33.030 --> 05:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
look at paperwork work that they had and
 
05:13:35.150 --> 05:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
and realized oh yeah that was my issue
 
05:13:38.190 --> 05:13:38.200 align:start position:0%
and corrected it um other times they may
 
05:13:40.990 --> 05:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
have taped all of their paperwork inside
 
05:13:42.990 --> 05:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
of The Ballot Box although we don't
 
05:13:44.830 --> 05:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
recommend um that they seal up their
 
05:13:46.430 --> 05:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
notes at the end of election night
 
05:13:48.590 --> 05:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes it happens um and they are
 
05:13:52.708 --> 05:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
unable to um confidently say what the
 
05:13:54.788 --> 05:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
issue may have
 
05:13:57.030 --> 05:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
been represent
 
05:13:59.310 --> 05:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
wood thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:14:02.110 --> 05:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um is the Secretary
 
05:14:04.910 --> 05:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
of State Department aware item six here
 
05:14:08.708 --> 05:14:08.718 align:start position:0%
says she found 22 polling places where
 
05:14:12.310 --> 05:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
the number exceeds 100% is your office
 
05:14:17.830 --> 05:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
aware of any example of a of a u place
 
05:14:21.708 --> 05:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
where the number of cast ballots that's
 
05:14:24.390 --> 05:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
what I'm reading here exceeds 100% of
 
05:14:25.750 --> 05:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
the eligible
 
05:14:28.628 --> 05:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
voters um thank you for the question not
 
05:14:30.830 --> 05:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge uh I know that there was
 
05:14:33.868 --> 05:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
a misprint in our red book for one town
 
05:14:37.868 --> 05:14:37.878 align:start position:0%
um that did represent that um I really
 
05:14:40.230 --> 05:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
hope we don't make that mistake again
 
05:14:44.430 --> 05:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
but that was a misprint um yeah can I
 
05:14:47.030 --> 05:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah I'm sorry you you sent me
 
05:14:49.350 --> 05:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
on another uh another trip down memory
 
05:14:52.310 --> 05:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
lane yeah go ahead yeah so what would be
 
05:14:52.320 --> 05:14:53.230 align:start position:0%
lane yeah go ahead yeah so what would be
the

05:14:53.230 --> 05:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:14:57.270 --> 05:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
problem with Implement if there was 100%
 
05:15:00.190 --> 05:15:00.200 align:start position:0%
how could you say that there weren't
 
05:15:02.230 --> 05:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
voters disenfranchised
 
05:15:05.350 --> 05:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
in that process if you cannot if if you
 
05:15:07.990 --> 05:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
have votes if your system comes up with
 
05:15:10.548 --> 05:15:10.558 align:start position:0%
more votes than registered voters by we
 
05:15:12.750 --> 05:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
we spent all this time collecting this
 
05:15:15.470 --> 05:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
I'm stting to testify sorry thank you
 
05:15:17.548 --> 05:15:17.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for correcting me he's trained
 
05:15:18.868 --> 05:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
would you would you believe would you
 
05:15:21.750 --> 05:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
believe no uh if I know all I'm saying
 
05:15:24.190 --> 05:15:24.200 align:start position:0%
is how would that hurt if we had 100% it
 
05:15:27.350 --> 05:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:30.430 --> 05:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
problem so as an accountant I like to De
 
05:15:32.910 --> 05:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
deal in details so so right now the bill
 
05:15:36.110 --> 05:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
says ballot count which I see as a huge
 
05:15:36.120 --> 05:15:37.628 align:start position:0%
says ballot count which I see as a huge
issue

05:15:37.628 --> 05:15:37.638 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:15:41.510 --> 05:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh um so I think that for me to give an
 
05:15:42.830 --> 05:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
opinion on what you've just said I would
 
05:15:44.830 --> 05:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
just mean more details in the specifics
 
05:15:45.708 --> 05:15:45.718 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:15:49.070 --> 05:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
situation thank you we let um secretary
 
05:15:50.190 --> 05:15:50.200 align:start position:0%

05:15:51.628 --> 05:15:51.638 align:start position:0%
pressing question yes representative

05:15:57.830 --> 05:15:57.840 align:start position:0%

05:16:01.628 --> 05:16:01.638 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire of any instance any
 
05:16:04.390 --> 05:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
evidence any legitimate evidence of
 
05:16:06.070 --> 05:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
widespread voter
 
05:16:08.990 --> 05:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
fraud thank you for the question um
 
05:16:11.310 --> 05:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
there are instances but there's no
 
05:16:11.320 --> 05:16:12.750 align:start position:0%
there are instances but there's no
widespread

05:16:12.750 --> 05:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
widespread
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
instances thank you thank you thank you
 
05:16:19.030 --> 05:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary um next up will be uh
 
05:16:28.270 --> 05:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:31.270 --> 05:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
votes good afternoon uh chairman members
 
05:16:32.750 --> 05:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
of the the committee my name is McKenzie
 
05:16:35.788 --> 05:16:35.798 align:start position:0%
St Germain um I am the campaign director
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire campaign for
 
05:16:38.590 --> 05:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
voting rights which is a project of
 
05:16:40.628 --> 05:16:40.638 align:start position:0%
America votes uh here today in
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 1348 um wanted
 
05:16:45.548 --> 05:16:45.558 align:start position:0%
to start off by saying we know that
 
05:16:47.708 --> 05:16:47.718 align:start position:0%
there was not widespread voter fraud in
 
05:16:50.390 --> 05:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
2016 there's no evidence of fraud in any
 
05:16:53.310 --> 05:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
sort of New Hampshire elections um and
 
05:16:55.548 --> 05:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
our current registration laws do require
 
05:16:58.788 --> 05:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
that new registrants provide ID when
 
05:17:01.070 --> 05:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
they register to vote for the first time
 
05:17:03.430 --> 05:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
um and need to provide ID within 7 days
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
if they don't have it on Election Day
 
05:17:06.270 --> 05:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
for their ballot to count so I think
 
05:17:08.030 --> 05:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
that is worthwhile forone keeping in
 
05:17:10.670 --> 05:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
mind I also just in the context of this
 
05:17:12.788 --> 05:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
conversation was able to quickly pull up
 
05:17:14.470 --> 05:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
some of the numbers from the Secretary
 
05:17:18.430 --> 05:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
of State's website for 2016 there were
 
05:17:23.788 --> 05:17:23.798 align:start position:0%
755,000 ballots cast there were 1,
 
05:17:26.788 --> 05:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
7,42 people on the checklist and the
 
05:17:29.110 --> 05:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
citizen voting age population according
 
05:17:32.150 --> 05:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
to Census Data at that point was around
 
05:17:35.470 --> 05:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
uh 1, 35,000 so some context of what the
 
05:17:37.230 --> 05:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
state is providing for us in terms of
 
05:17:39.430 --> 05:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
both ballots cast voters in the
 
05:17:41.150 --> 05:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
checklist and citizen voting age
 
05:17:43.270 --> 05:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
population this bill is incredibly
 
05:17:47.548 --> 05:17:47.558 align:start position:0%
concerning um in terms of removing votes
 
05:17:50.350 --> 05:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
wrongfully from uh the count because of
 
05:17:52.750 --> 05:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
a mistake that could be made um if
 
05:17:56.470 --> 05:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
someone you if uh voters who are
 
05:17:57.910 --> 05:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
eligible voters cast their ballots we
 
05:18:00.110 --> 05:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
should never be removing their votes
 
05:18:02.788 --> 05:18:02.798 align:start position:0%
from the results I not aware of any case
 
05:18:05.470 --> 05:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
in which there was actually data that
 
05:18:07.708 --> 05:18:07.718 align:start position:0%
there were more ballots count or more
 
05:18:10.350 --> 05:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
ballots cast than the number of people
 
05:18:12.070 --> 05:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
who were registered to vote or who were
 
05:18:15.350 --> 05:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
in the town um as deputy secretary
 
05:18:16.868 --> 05:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
testified I know there were some
 
05:18:18.910 --> 05:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
independent cases where numbers were
 
05:18:21.390 --> 05:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
written down wrong on the form we should
 
05:18:23.150 --> 05:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely make sure that those are
 
05:18:25.350 --> 05:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
addressed and corrected in any place
 
05:18:27.470 --> 05:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
where it seems that there are more
 
05:18:29.590 --> 05:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
ballots cast than voters that is
 
05:18:32.150 --> 05:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely an issue that we need to
 
05:18:35.510 --> 05:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
figure out you know recounting doing a
 
05:18:38.350 --> 05:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
um a recount a hand count diving into
 
05:18:39.830 --> 05:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
what happened there that absolutely is
 
05:18:42.310 --> 05:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
an issue we must remedy if it were to
 
05:18:45.708 --> 05:18:45.718 align:start position:0%
happen however removing eligible voters
 
05:18:48.190 --> 05:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
votes from the election is unacceptable
 
05:18:50.590 --> 05:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
and not something uh that we should
 
05:18:52.750 --> 05:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
allow to happen in our New Hampshire
 
05:18:54.470 --> 05:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
elections okay will you piaying
 
05:18:57.110 --> 05:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
questions sure are there questions
 
05:18:59.110 --> 05:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you last up
 
05:19:00.868 --> 05:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
to last up with the pink card is Olivia
 
05:19:02.708 --> 05:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
Inc from open democracy um
 
05:19:03.990 --> 05:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative anenberg you start
 
05:19:05.470 --> 05:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
tossing that blue
 
05:19:08.590 --> 05:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
sheet I wasn't planning to testify but
 
05:19:11.708 --> 05:19:11.718 align:start position:0%
um Olivia zinc uh with open democracy um
 
05:19:13.670 --> 05:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
I I want to speak on a couple of things
 
05:19:15.590 --> 05:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
that have been said here in this
 
05:19:17.350 --> 05:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
testimony I I had the pleasure of
 
05:19:18.708 --> 05:19:18.718 align:start position:0%
serving on the voter confidence
 
05:19:20.190 --> 05:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
committee and I traveled around the
 
05:19:23.150 --> 05:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
state listening to testimony about uh
 
05:19:24.868 --> 05:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
how we can improve voter confidence and
 
05:19:26.230 --> 05:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's really important that we
 
05:19:28.230 --> 05:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
think about how to improve voter
 
05:19:30.750 --> 05:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
confidence um but when we look at the
 
05:19:32.948 --> 05:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
you know line three and four on total
 
05:19:34.868 --> 05:19:34.878 align:start position:0%
ballots counted at the end of the night
 
05:19:38.110 --> 05:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
normally it's 10 or 11 or late after a
 
05:19:40.510 --> 05:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
long day moderators are filling this out
 
05:19:43.470 --> 05:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
and the total number of ballots count
 
05:19:46.390 --> 05:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
includes blank ballots so you could have
 
05:19:48.070 --> 05:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
blank appsente T ballots and you can
 
05:19:51.548 --> 05:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
have blank regular ballots so the total
 
05:19:53.470 --> 05:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
number of ballots and the secretary of
 
05:19:55.230 --> 05:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
state is who decides how many ballots
 
05:19:57.430 --> 05:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
are printed and sent to each community
 
05:19:59.390 --> 05:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
and and I think they do a very good job
 
05:20:01.548 --> 05:20:01.558 align:start position:0%
estimating but they're often times
 
05:20:03.590 --> 05:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
there's leftover ballots sometimes towns
 
05:20:05.548 --> 05:20:05.558 align:start position:0%
have to print more but I think that this
 
05:20:08.390 --> 05:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be ballots cast online four
 
05:20:10.750 --> 05:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely if you move forward but also
 
05:20:13.750 --> 05:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
I think that this legislation
 
05:20:16.548 --> 05:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
um I think we could do a better job
 
05:20:18.548 --> 05:20:18.558 align:start position:0%
updating the moderators worksheet so
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
that the moderators are all reporting
 
05:20:23.750 --> 05:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
the same things I have seen mistakes
 
05:20:26.350 --> 05:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
where handwriting mistakes where a
 
05:20:28.670 --> 05:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
moderator number is wrong in the total
 
05:20:30.788 --> 05:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
number and when it a couple of days
 
05:20:32.548 --> 05:20:32.558 align:start position:0%
later there's an updated list on the
 
05:20:34.390 --> 05:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office with the
 
05:20:36.708 --> 05:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
corrected moderator number so this I
 
05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
have seen this happen where there's
 
05:20:41.590 --> 05:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
number of of Voters but it's oftentimes
 
05:20:44.510 --> 05:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
a mistake and it's reprinted two or
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
three days after the election um but I
 
05:20:48.548 --> 05:20:48.558 align:start position:0%
would love to see a moderator's
 
05:20:50.628 --> 05:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
worksheet written in plain English so
 
05:20:52.628 --> 05:20:52.638 align:start position:0%
every moderator could understand it and
 
05:20:55.350 --> 05:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
I would also love to see moderators
 
05:20:57.830 --> 05:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
enter this information on like a form
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that there's not a somebody
 
05:21:01.230 --> 05:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
interpreting the handwriting of the
 
05:21:02.510 --> 05:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
moderator and putting it in a
 
05:21:04.628 --> 05:21:04.638 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet um I think that would do a
 
05:21:06.628 --> 05:21:06.638 align:start position:0%
lot more to increase voter confidence
 
05:21:08.788 --> 05:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
than a bill like this happy to take
 
05:21:11.230 --> 05:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
questions any questions seeing none
 
05:21:12.750 --> 05:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
thank you there's no one else signed up
 
05:21:15.430 --> 05:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
to speak uh with that I will close the
 
05:21:17.948 --> 05:21:17.958 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
 
05:21:20.310 --> 05:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
1348 uh there was no one signed up on
 
05:21:21.868 --> 05:21:21.878 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet online there were seven
 
05:21:24.070 --> 05:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
in support and 22 opposed that I'm
 
05:21:25.830 --> 05:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
closing the
 
05:21:28.350 --> 05:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
1348 I'm going to immediately open the
 
05:21:30.030 --> 05:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
 
05:21:33.030 --> 05:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
1381 relative to required training on
 
05:21:36.070 --> 05:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
Election procedures I will recognize I
 
05:21:48.070 --> 05:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:50.590 --> 05:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
presenting yes thank you Mr chair and
 
05:21:52.230 --> 05:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members for the
 
05:21:53.948 --> 05:21:53.958 align:start position:0%
record my name is Robert W I have the
 
05:21:55.868 --> 05:21:55.878 align:start position:0%
privilege of serving in
 
05:21:58.910 --> 05:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro's County uh 13th District the
 
05:21:59.948 --> 05:21:59.958 align:start position:0%
great town of
 
05:22:02.430 --> 05:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
Hudson renowned in yester year for the
 
05:22:05.390 --> 05:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
home of Benson's wild animal farm
 
05:22:08.788 --> 05:22:08.798 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:22:13.510 --> 05:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
where so for thir uh for 1381
 
05:22:18.350 --> 05:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
um we've heard um um Miss zinc just uh
 
05:22:20.990 --> 05:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
made reference to the uh report on the
 
05:22:23.230 --> 05:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
special committee on voter confidence uh
 
05:22:24.628 --> 05:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
back from
 
05:22:27.350 --> 05:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
2022 and that stated that public
 
05:22:29.910 --> 05:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
confidence is high because elections are
 
05:22:31.470 --> 05:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
administered at the local local level
 
05:22:33.990 --> 05:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
according to State guidelines and so
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
efforts should be uh made to ensure that
 
05:22:38.350 --> 05:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
proper training in these State
 
05:22:41.350 --> 05:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
guidelines for elections um are
 
05:22:44.230 --> 05:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
available to the uh local Personnel
 
05:22:46.990 --> 05:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
conducting the elections secretary of
 
05:22:48.910 --> 05:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
state currently offers training on the
 
05:22:52.150 --> 05:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
election procedures and has repeatedly
 
05:22:54.628 --> 05:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
reported to this fine committee that
 
05:22:57.628 --> 05:22:57.638 align:start position:0%
election procedures training is often
 
05:22:59.990 --> 05:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
poorly attended with less than 50% of
 
05:23:02.110 --> 05:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
the communities
 
05:23:06.910 --> 05:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
participating um that uh 2022 report on
 
05:23:09.948 --> 05:23:09.958 align:start position:0%
voter confidence also made repeated
 
05:23:12.708 --> 05:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
recommendations to require proper
 
05:23:14.910 --> 05:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
training for the administration of
 
05:23:18.470 --> 05:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
Elections at the local level and then um
 
05:23:22.110 --> 05:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
last week we have heard um about issues
 
05:23:26.990 --> 05:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
in the uh fine town of Windam as well as
 
05:23:29.590 --> 05:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
in the uh Senate District race the
 
05:23:30.948 --> 05:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
issues that were brought up with there
 
05:23:35.708 --> 05:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
there and certainly some of those um uh
 
05:23:41.590 --> 05:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
scores and um and uh large numbers of
 
05:23:44.510 --> 05:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
Errors could have been reduced by
 
05:23:44.520 --> 05:23:45.510 align:start position:0%
Errors could have been reduced by
adequate

05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
05:23:49.628 --> 05:23:49.638 align:start position:0%
training so I you know this is this requ
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
request for training um in no way should
 
05:23:55.910 --> 05:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
impune the many wonderful clerks and
 
05:23:58.470 --> 05:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
moderators that we have um there are a
 
05:24:00.948 --> 05:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
number of election officials in New
 
05:24:03.030 --> 05:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who diligently performed their
 
05:24:05.708 --> 05:24:05.718 align:start position:0%
job and handled their responsibilities
 
05:24:08.590 --> 05:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
with great professionalism and integrity
 
05:24:10.310 --> 05:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
and these individuals are probably in
 
05:24:12.990 --> 05:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
the majority but they are not the
 
05:24:16.190 --> 05:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
problem um as we saw from these forensic
 
05:24:17.788 --> 05:24:17.798 align:start position:0%
audits that were conducted within the
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
last several years um there are clearly
 
05:24:23.470 --> 05:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
some areas of great negligence and where
 
05:24:25.150 --> 05:24:25.160 align:start position:0%
people have abdicated their
 
05:24:28.110 --> 05:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities our voters deserve more
 
05:24:29.948 --> 05:24:29.958 align:start position:0%
and so this specific training
 
05:24:32.230 --> 05:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
requirement in this proposed Bill
 
05:24:34.230 --> 05:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
Endeavors to close that
 
05:24:39.430 --> 05:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
Gap specifically um it and I don't I
 
05:24:41.628 --> 05:24:41.638 align:start position:0%
don't think it the Secretary of State's
 
05:24:44.430 --> 05:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
office will comment on this um but we've
 
05:24:46.990 --> 05:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
already known that that training is
 
05:24:49.350 --> 05:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
available and being provided so I don't
 
05:24:51.628 --> 05:24:51.638 align:start position:0%
think we're by codifying it I don't
 
05:24:53.150 --> 05:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
think we're putting an additional burden
 
05:24:57.948 --> 05:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
on that off office but um I'll wait uh
 
05:24:59.830 --> 05:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office to
 
05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
testify to that
 
05:25:05.548 --> 05:25:05.558 align:start position:0%
um and so basically this just um adds
 
05:25:08.230 --> 05:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
that this training should be documented
 
05:25:11.548 --> 05:25:11.558 align:start position:0%
and that it should be required and that
 
05:25:14.788 --> 05:25:14.798 align:start position:0%
um elsewhere where we already have um
 
05:25:17.110 --> 05:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions for lack of training under
 
05:25:17.120 --> 05:25:18.788 align:start position:0%
Provisions for lack of training under
RSA

05:25:18.788 --> 05:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
05:25:21.350 --> 05:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
65977 that that would also be addressed
 
05:25:25.788 --> 05:25:25.798 align:start position:0%
so um that's it and with that I am happy
 
05:25:27.270 --> 05:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
05:25:29.910 --> 05:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the committee
 
05:25:32.430 --> 05:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh repres Vice chairman M excuse
 
05:25:34.708 --> 05:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
me thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:25:37.110 --> 05:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
taking the question one of the problems
 
05:25:39.948 --> 05:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
I see here is with the Secretary of
 
05:25:41.430 --> 05:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
State already
 
05:25:44.548 --> 05:25:44.558 align:start position:0%
offering education is all the people are
 
05:25:46.310 --> 05:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
volunteers including the moderator who
 
05:25:48.030 --> 05:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't make that much and they have
 
05:25:50.470 --> 05:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
jobs it might be difficult them to do
 
05:25:52.350 --> 05:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
any training other than reading the
 
05:25:55.110 --> 05:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
manual and like the added says you can
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
lead a horse to water but you can't make
 
05:25:59.350 --> 05:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
him drink and so the same thing is
 
05:26:02.510 --> 05:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
happening here and I don't see it
 
05:26:02.520 --> 05:26:04.868 align:start position:0%
happening here and I don't see it
requiring

05:26:04.868 --> 05:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
05:26:07.910 --> 05:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
but what what if somebody doesn't go
 
05:26:09.670 --> 05:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
what do you
 
05:26:12.750 --> 05:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
do well well that's what uh provision
 
05:26:16.110 --> 05:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
number four I believe addresses that if
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
if they fail to attend it's considered a
 
05:26:20.708 --> 05:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
lack of training as already codified in
 
05:26:20.718 --> 05:26:21.548 align:start position:0%
lack of training as already codified in
the

05:26:21.548 --> 05:26:21.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:26:25.868 --> 05:26:25.878 align:start position:0%
RSA so follow up yeah so what happens
 
05:26:28.548 --> 05:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
then though they have a lack of training
 
05:26:32.270 --> 05:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
but what does that do to the
 
05:26:35.390 --> 05:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
um this doesn't provide for any
 
05:26:38.628 --> 05:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement um but this this identifies
 
05:26:40.750 --> 05:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a problem in
 
05:26:43.310 --> 05:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
terms of training and Doc documents
 
05:26:45.830 --> 05:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not the training has been
 
05:26:48.830 --> 05:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
completed and
 
05:26:51.548 --> 05:26:51.558 align:start position:0%
um attended
 
05:26:55.708 --> 05:26:55.718 align:start position:0%
to so um I've I just I want to actually
 
05:26:57.628 --> 05:26:57.638 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I was was having lunch
 
05:26:59.150 --> 05:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
with my parents today and my dad asked
 
05:27:01.030 --> 05:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
me the four years you've been three
 
05:27:02.190 --> 05:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
years doing this have you read the
 
05:27:04.510 --> 05:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
entire section of RSA all the election
 
05:27:05.910 --> 05:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
laws I said probably not all of them but
 
05:27:07.708 --> 05:27:07.718 align:start position:0%
there's not much I'm missing uh this was
 
05:27:09.310 --> 05:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
actually one of them so I just read it
 
05:27:10.510 --> 05:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
while you were giving your testimony so
 
05:27:12.390 --> 05:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
what happens is during lack when they
 
05:27:16.190 --> 05:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
finding of lack of training um means
 
05:27:18.390 --> 05:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
that the a Attorney General's office
 
05:27:22.708 --> 05:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
will appoint a election moderator so my
 
05:27:25.750 --> 05:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is is if you don't go to
 
05:27:28.470 --> 05:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
the training then the Attorney General's
 
05:27:30.788 --> 05:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
office would then basically see an over
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
or that's what I just read at
 
05:27:35.270 --> 05:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
least I have a question for you did you
 
05:27:38.150 --> 05:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
mean to say monitor monitor did I say
 
05:27:40.430 --> 05:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
moderator I meant monitor excuse me
 
05:27:42.788 --> 05:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
monitor so but anyways thank you for
 
05:27:44.110 --> 05:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
that I didn't even know that section
 
05:27:47.470 --> 05:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
existed and now I do um happy to provide
 
05:27:48.868 --> 05:27:48.878 align:start position:0%
you that thrill because I had that I had
 
05:27:50.830 --> 05:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
that same question representative Bo has
 
05:27:54.110 --> 05:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
and I just went went got to reading uh
 
05:27:55.830 --> 05:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the
 
05:27:58.350 --> 05:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
05:28:03.548 --> 05:28:03.558 align:start position:0%
hamr thank you it's um would you believe
 
05:28:06.788 --> 05:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
would you that I'm election official in
 
05:28:10.990 --> 05:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester and to get our full pay of
 
05:28:13.190 --> 05:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars for working that
 
05:28:13.200 --> 05:28:15.150 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars for working that
one

05:28:15.150 --> 05:28:15.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:28:19.430 --> 05:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
day um we have to attend a training and
 
05:28:22.350 --> 05:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
work the election right so would you
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
believe that you had to attend training
 
05:28:27.110 --> 05:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
yet I yes i' I've attended my own Town's
 
05:28:29.310 --> 05:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
training practices I I think they're
 
05:28:33.470 --> 05:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
very good um part of this though allows
 
05:28:35.628 --> 05:28:35.638 align:start position:0%
for the Secretary of State to record the
 
05:28:39.470 --> 05:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
training so um I can't speak for every
 
05:28:41.430 --> 05:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
moderator but my moderator is certainly
 
05:28:44.830 --> 05:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
very diligent he attends the training um
 
05:28:48.150 --> 05:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know and then communicates that uh
 
05:28:50.510 --> 05:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
the lessons learned to the group of
 
05:28:53.590 --> 05:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
people group of volunteers that have uh
 
05:28:56.310 --> 05:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
agreed to participate in the election
 
05:28:58.030 --> 05:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
and he communicates that and trains them
 
05:29:00.830 --> 05:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
very well this is meant again as I said
 
05:29:03.350 --> 05:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
in one of my uh remarks on my Preamble
 
05:29:05.750 --> 05:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
there this is not to impune the many
 
05:29:07.708 --> 05:29:07.718 align:start position:0%
wonderful moderators and clerks who do
 
05:29:09.670 --> 05:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
their job and do attend the training but
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
this is to really provide a mechanism
 
05:29:13.990 --> 05:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
where you know they can attend online
 
05:29:16.990 --> 05:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
training you know maybe I agree
 
05:29:20.628 --> 05:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
that not everyone can be an uh at an
 
05:29:22.788 --> 05:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
on-site training and conqueror and I'm
 
05:29:24.470 --> 05:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
sure there are Regional offerings of
 
05:29:27.190 --> 05:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
training but even so that may conflict
 
05:29:30.510 --> 05:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
with other um commitments in in one's
 
05:29:33.390 --> 05:29:33.400 align:start position:0%
life so the very fact that that training
 
05:29:35.350 --> 05:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
could be recorded and then viewed at a
 
05:29:37.788 --> 05:29:37.798 align:start position:0%
subsequent time as allowed in this
 
05:29:40.390 --> 05:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
proposed bill I think expands the
 
05:29:43.150 --> 05:29:43.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity or uh removes the
 
05:29:45.110 --> 05:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities for lack of training if
 
05:29:47.990 --> 05:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
you will so okay further questions from
 
05:29:48.000 --> 05:29:48.670 align:start position:0%
you will so okay further questions from
the

05:29:48.670 --> 05:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:29:51.910 --> 05:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative
 
05:29:54.350 --> 05:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
katab just wondering knowing that the
 
05:29:56.110 --> 05:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
election schedule would place a new
 
05:29:58.830 --> 05:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
moderator into position in March why
 
05:30:00.750 --> 05:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
would we do this for the general ction
 
05:30:03.230 --> 05:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
and not for the state primary why would
 
05:30:05.270 --> 05:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
we if if we want to have training why
 
05:30:07.230 --> 05:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to skip the
 
05:30:09.750 --> 05:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
September primary and only give training
 
05:30:14.590 --> 05:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:16.948 --> 05:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
General prior to a state uh state
 
05:30:19.070 --> 05:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
general election well that that may need
 
05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
to be something that's amended
 
05:30:25.470 --> 05:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
um so you're you're talking about line
 
05:30:29.110 --> 05:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
18 I assume um correct where it talks
 
05:30:30.990 --> 05:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
about that general election we may need
 
05:30:33.548 --> 05:30:33.558 align:start position:0%
to write an amendment to expand that to
 
05:30:37.030 --> 05:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
the appropriate races and so on thank
 
05:30:40.430 --> 05:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
you okay further questions seeing none
 
05:30:43.110 --> 05:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weie um next up
 
05:30:53.510 --> 05:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:55.350 --> 05:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
Hennessy thank you everyone Aaron
 
05:30:57.030 --> 05:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
Hennessy deputy secretary of state I
 
05:30:58.670 --> 05:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
think I need to sponsor this microphone
 
05:31:01.310 --> 05:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
I've been up here so many times today
 
05:31:03.470 --> 05:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
um first I want to thank the sponsor of
 
05:31:05.270 --> 05:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
this bill for recognizing that in New
 
05:31:08.190 --> 05:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have wonderful elected uh
 
05:31:10.750 --> 05:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
election officials uh who do a great job
 
05:31:13.830 --> 05:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire elections um this
 
05:31:16.788 --> 05:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
bill um would put into law pretty much
 
05:31:18.310 --> 05:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
everything we're already doing in our
 
05:31:22.150 --> 05:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
office um we do a lot of uh inperson
 
05:31:23.990 --> 05:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
around the state training I think we did
 
05:31:26.590 --> 05:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
13 different in-person trainings U
 
05:31:28.948 --> 05:31:28.958 align:start position:0%
before the presidential primary we
 
05:31:31.110 --> 05:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
recognize that not everyone is able to
 
05:31:33.830 --> 05:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
do in person training um and that we
 
05:31:35.788 --> 05:31:35.798 align:start position:0%
have a very um diverse State
 
05:31:37.470 --> 05:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
geographically where if you live up in
 
05:31:39.390 --> 05:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
Coos County you're not going to go to a
 
05:31:41.230 --> 05:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
training in Keen very easily when you
 
05:31:44.670 --> 05:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
have a full-time job so we also offer um
 
05:31:48.628 --> 05:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
online training um where we record um
 
05:31:50.750 --> 05:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much PowerPoint slide type of
 
05:31:53.030 --> 05:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
presentations um they're not as as good
 
05:31:54.628 --> 05:31:54.638 align:start position:0%
as our in-person training because you
 
05:31:57.750 --> 05:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
can't ask questions um but we also try
 
05:31:59.788 --> 05:31:59.798 align:start position:0%
to do um and what we've done in the past
 
05:32:04.990 --> 05:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
is a we record a online um uh session
 
05:32:06.750 --> 05:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
where we do a presentation and then we
 
05:32:09.110 --> 05:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
open it up for questions so you may not
 
05:32:11.628 --> 05:32:11.638 align:start position:0%
if you're watching this recorded online
 
05:32:13.628 --> 05:32:13.638 align:start position:0%
training at a later date you may not be
 
05:32:14.990 --> 05:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
able to ask a question but you can
 
05:32:16.590 --> 05:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
listen to all the other questions that
 
05:32:19.110 --> 05:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
were asked um in the live online
 
05:32:22.270 --> 05:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
training um but we do have many many
 
05:32:24.910 --> 05:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
many different um recorded online
 
05:32:26.910 --> 05:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
trainings is available for any election
 
05:32:29.470 --> 05:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
official um if election officials do not
 
05:32:31.430 --> 05:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
have access to this um they should reach
 
05:32:33.670 --> 05:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
out to their Town Clerk or to our office
 
05:32:35.990 --> 05:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
um we um spread this out to anyone who
 
05:32:38.310 --> 05:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
has an email address in our Statewide
 
05:32:43.110 --> 05:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:46.070 --> 05:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
um and we are constantly expanding our
 
05:32:48.868 --> 05:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
trainings um I do want to point out that
 
05:32:51.230 --> 05:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
this um that there are a lot of
 
05:32:53.670 --> 05:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
different elected election officials um
 
05:32:56.230 --> 05:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
this bill does just speak to two groups
 
05:32:58.150 --> 05:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
of them um we also have select board
 
05:33:00.070 --> 05:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
members and we have supervisors of the
 
05:33:01.628 --> 05:33:01.638 align:start position:0%
checklists that also do a great job in
 
05:33:04.510 --> 05:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
our elections um but the the roles are
 
05:33:06.708 --> 05:33:06.718 align:start position:0%
different between moderators and clerks
 
05:33:10.868 --> 05:33:10.878 align:start position:0%
and supervisors and select people so um
 
05:33:12.750 --> 05:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
just giving you that information the
 
05:33:15.350 --> 05:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
only new part I see about this bill is
 
05:33:18.430 --> 05:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
the lines 26 through
 
05:33:22.708 --> 05:33:22.718 align:start position:0%
28 otherwise we do um we currently do
 
05:33:25.030 --> 05:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
what the bill requires of
 
05:33:27.070 --> 05:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
us questions from the
 
05:33:29.990 --> 05:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative rafter have
 
05:33:32.390 --> 05:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
heard from you today thank you thank you
 
05:33:34.150 --> 05:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question since this
 
05:33:36.628 --> 05:33:36.638 align:start position:0%
requires attendance at training how
 
05:33:38.470 --> 05:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
would you confirm that somebody has
 
05:33:41.110 --> 05:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
attended if they don't attend in person
 
05:33:44.150 --> 05:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
great question um you when we um have
 
05:33:46.548 --> 05:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
our on and I don't remember the name of
 
05:33:48.628 --> 05:33:48.638 align:start position:0%
the program but you have to request
 
05:33:50.430 --> 05:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
access to the program with your email
 
05:33:52.230 --> 05:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
address and then click the link that you
 
05:33:55.350 --> 05:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
get to to do the online training um I'll
 
05:33:57.628 --> 05:33:57.638 align:start position:0%
have to confirm if we can see if you've
 
05:34:01.270 --> 05:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
Le left it but we can't tell if you put
 
05:34:03.070 --> 05:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
it on and then you left the room and
 
05:34:05.110 --> 05:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
didn't watch
 
05:34:07.470 --> 05:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
it no one would ever do that no one
 
05:34:10.310 --> 05:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
would ever do that come on Zoom meeting
 
05:34:11.990 --> 05:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
we do have Vlogs of people who have
 
05:34:14.750 --> 05:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
requested it um and watched it um and we
 
05:34:16.708 --> 05:34:16.718 align:start position:0%

05:34:33.708 --> 05:34:33.718 align:start position:0%
twofold question if you don't mind Mr
 
05:34:36.628 --> 05:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
chair okay give the old two
 
05:34:39.350 --> 05:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
parts how often are the training uh
 
05:34:41.150 --> 05:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
online training materials
 
05:34:44.430 --> 05:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
updated and uh when you say update what
 
05:34:48.470 --> 05:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
type of update um is is done like and
 
05:34:50.628 --> 05:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
and the spirit of my question is okay if
 
05:34:52.590 --> 05:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
you have uh old PowerPoints before they
 
05:34:54.750 --> 05:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
just update the PowerPoint or after
 
05:34:56.750 --> 05:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
doing it so many years you now have a
 
05:35:00.750 --> 05:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
master class uh type of training
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
material that's a great question we
 
05:35:04.788 --> 05:35:04.798 align:start position:0%
don't have a master class but um if we
 
05:35:06.310 --> 05:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
had more money and more people we could
 
05:35:10.070 --> 05:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
create one um we I would say on average
 
05:35:11.670 --> 05:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
again I've only been with the office for
 
05:35:13.070 --> 05:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
about a year and a half now but on
 
05:35:14.990 --> 05:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
average I would say we update them at
 
05:35:18.110 --> 05:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
least every two years um if you if your
 
05:35:20.830 --> 05:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
role as a ballot clerk
 
05:35:24.430 --> 05:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
um um is ballot Clerk and it continues
 
05:35:26.948 --> 05:35:26.958 align:start position:0%
to be ballot clerk there may not be any
 
05:35:29.788 --> 05:35:29.798 align:start position:0%
new legislation that has changed like
 
05:35:32.510 --> 05:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
right now we have write AV next to an
 
05:35:35.110 --> 05:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
absentee voter in red pend if there were
 
05:35:37.350 --> 05:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
legislation that would change that to
 
05:35:40.070 --> 05:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
Red pen highlighted in yellow we would
 
05:35:42.230 --> 05:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
update our presentation to make sure
 
05:35:43.708 --> 05:35:43.718 align:start position:0%
that the ballot clerks knew that does
 
05:35:45.948 --> 05:35:45.958 align:start position:0%
that make sense and then we also
 
05:35:50.230 --> 05:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
do um any Law changes we do an update on
 
05:35:53.868 --> 05:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
specifically any Law changes in
 
05:35:56.310 --> 05:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
general questions representative prud
 
05:35:59.350 --> 05:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
home O'Brien thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:36:00.948 --> 05:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question are
 
05:36:00.958 --> 05:36:01.948 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question are
there

05:36:01.948 --> 05:36:01.958 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:36:06.708 --> 05:36:06.718 align:start position:0%
any things materials uh that that these
 
05:36:08.470 --> 05:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
election officials can walk away with
 
05:36:11.350 --> 05:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
such as a certificate of having attended
 
05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
or a badge I know that's probably not
 
05:36:16.548 --> 05:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
the case but but something something
 
05:36:20.270 --> 05:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
that they can show to the community
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
somehow just um that's a great question
 
05:36:26.230 --> 05:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
I know uh because the clerk's
 
05:36:28.548 --> 05:36:28.558 align:start position:0%
Association is an organized Association
 
05:36:30.350 --> 05:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
and has regular meetings
 
05:36:32.868 --> 05:36:32.878 align:start position:0%
that when we attend their annual meeting
 
05:36:35.670 --> 05:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh the secretary does hand out um
 
05:36:38.030 --> 05:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
recognition certificates for those that
 
05:36:41.110 --> 05:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
have uh attended the most um trainings
 
05:36:42.350 --> 05:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if there's a certain
 
05:36:44.948 --> 05:36:44.958 align:start position:0%
threshold um for those certificates but
 
05:36:48.670 --> 05:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have any um Rockstar badges or
 
05:36:50.230 --> 05:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
anything like that for election
 
05:36:53.070 --> 05:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
officials it might be a good idea okay
 
05:36:55.350 --> 05:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh last question representative wood yes
 
05:36:56.868 --> 05:36:56.878 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you takeing my
 
05:36:59.190 --> 05:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
question now um they mentioned here
 
05:36:59.200 --> 05:37:00.150 align:start position:0%
question now um they mentioned here
about

05:37:00.150 --> 05:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:37:02.350 --> 05:37:02.360 align:start position:0%
about you sending an auditor or a
 
05:37:02.360 --> 05:37:03.910 align:start position:0%
about you sending an auditor or a
moderator

05:37:03.910 --> 05:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
moderator
 
05:37:08.190 --> 05:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
moderator if they do not uh for lack of
 
05:37:11.270 --> 05:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
training I notice at some polls that
 
05:37:13.788 --> 05:37:13.798 align:start position:0%
I've been at there have been uh somebody
 
05:37:16.270 --> 05:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
from the state moderated what initiates
 
05:37:19.868 --> 05:37:19.878 align:start position:0%
that is it random or is it is it some
 
05:37:21.548 --> 05:37:21.558 align:start position:0%
problem that initiates the moderator
 
05:37:24.310 --> 05:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
being the or inspector I'm not sure what
 
05:37:26.390 --> 05:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
the word is you can help me thank you
 
05:37:28.310 --> 05:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that you're referring
 
05:37:32.708 --> 05:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
to 65 977 and it's a monitor an election
 
05:37:35.190 --> 05:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
Monitor and it's it's a it's a formal
 
05:37:38.390 --> 05:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
process where um your polling location
 
05:37:40.910 --> 05:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
has been recognized that um you you did
 
05:37:43.910 --> 05:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
something wrong um it could be I'm not
 
05:37:46.910 --> 05:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
going to go into what it could be but um
 
05:37:49.868 --> 05:37:49.878 align:start position:0%
we did have one um in this past election
 
05:37:53.070 --> 05:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
I believe we may have had two or three
 
05:37:56.030 --> 05:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
previously um I've been a monitor myself
 
05:37:56.040 --> 05:37:57.390 align:start position:0%
previously um I've been a monitor myself
twice

05:37:57.390 --> 05:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
twice
 
05:38:00.390 --> 05:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
now F quick followup okay so this would
 
05:38:02.070 --> 05:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
be consistent pretty much what you're
 
05:38:07.910 --> 05:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:10.990 --> 05:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
correct yes representative P Brian yes
 
05:38:13.150 --> 05:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for uh letting me
 
05:38:15.750 --> 05:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
ask another question I was really
 
05:38:17.270 --> 05:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
interested in what representative HR
 
05:38:20.590 --> 05:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
said about the um connection between
 
05:38:22.868 --> 05:38:22.878 align:start position:0%
being paid as an ele election official
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
and her community of
 
05:38:26.830 --> 05:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh to the training she has to
 
05:38:29.948 --> 05:38:29.958 align:start position:0%
take the training it's a requirement uh
 
05:38:32.868 --> 05:38:32.878 align:start position:0%
are you aware is of other communities
 
05:38:35.190 --> 05:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
doing that is that a widespread practice
 
05:38:37.150 --> 05:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
do you um what do you know about that
 
05:38:39.030 --> 05:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you that's a great
 
05:38:41.110 --> 05:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
question I am aware of other communities
 
05:38:47.670 --> 05:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
that do require training um so a um I
 
05:38:50.230 --> 05:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
think it's if you some communities can't
 
05:38:51.590 --> 05:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
the clerk can't require that the
 
05:38:53.788 --> 05:38:53.798 align:start position:0%
supervisors go to training but they can
 
05:38:55.350 --> 05:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
require that the ballot clerks that they
 
05:39:00.990 --> 05:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
hire go to training um to an extent um
 
05:39:02.948 --> 05:39:02.958 align:start position:0%
further questions seeing none thank can
 
05:39:05.070 --> 05:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
I Mr chair can I just clarify something
 
05:39:08.708 --> 05:39:08.718 align:start position:0%
sure sir so um If This Were to go into
 
05:39:12.110 --> 05:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
effect and there were to be several um
 
05:39:14.150 --> 05:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
election election officials that did not
 
05:39:17.190 --> 05:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
go to training um I can't project what
 
05:39:19.868 --> 05:39:19.878 align:start position:0%
that would be but I can tell you that um
 
05:39:22.030 --> 05:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
our current process we're extremely
 
05:39:24.948 --> 05:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
strapped thin at um election time and if
 
05:39:28.070 --> 05:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
it did require us to hire a bunch of um
 
05:39:31.230 --> 05:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
election monitors who are experts in
 
05:39:33.948 --> 05:39:33.958 align:start position:0%
election um which usually sometimes is
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
either someone from our office or
 
05:39:39.350 --> 05:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
somebody who is a previous moderator um
 
05:39:41.270 --> 05:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
it would require it it may require
 
05:39:44.310 --> 05:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
additional Staffing um and additional
 
05:39:46.350 --> 05:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
money you have to talk to representative
 
05:39:51.830 --> 05:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:56.788 --> 05:39:56.798 align:start position:0%

I have no problem with required training
 
05:40:32.830 --> 05:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
um I do have an issue um and I'm going
 
05:40:35.750 --> 05:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
to start by turning your attention to
 
05:40:35.760 --> 05:40:38.190 align:start position:0%
to start by turning your attention to
lines

05:40:38.190 --> 05:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
lines
 
05:40:40.990 --> 05:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
123 and it says that the manual shall be
 
05:40:43.070 --> 05:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
distributed free of charge to each
 
05:40:45.270 --> 05:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
moderator Board of Selectmen city
 
05:40:47.070 --> 05:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
council Board of Supervisors of the
 
05:40:50.350 --> 05:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
checklist and to each town city and Ward
 
05:40:52.670 --> 05:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
Clerk and that's because there are
 
05:40:54.708 --> 05:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
sections in this manual this manual is
 
05:40:58.590 --> 05:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
400 and some odd pages that address each
 
05:40:58.600 --> 05:40:59.910 align:start position:0%
400 and some odd pages that address each
job

05:40:59.910 --> 05:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
job
 
05:41:02.670 --> 05:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
that these people are responsible
 
05:41:07.070 --> 05:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
for but sadly go from line 26
 
05:41:10.510 --> 05:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
down only the town award moderators and
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
clerks are being put on the hook and
 
05:41:18.430 --> 05:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
that is not okay um so a moderator does
 
05:41:20.430 --> 05:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
not register voters on Election Day
 
05:41:23.150 --> 05:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
that's the job of the supervisors of the
 
05:41:25.350 --> 05:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
checklist um the Selectmen have their
 
05:41:28.030 --> 05:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
own jobs in my town they're Town
 
05:41:30.030 --> 05:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
counselors but they still have their own
 
05:41:31.390 --> 05:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
jobs and
 
05:41:33.270 --> 05:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and it is more than
 
05:41:35.030 --> 05:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
just handing out stickers although
 
05:41:36.468 --> 05:41:36.478 align:start position:0%
that's what some people
 
05:41:36.478 --> 05:41:38.590 align:start position:0%
that's what some people
think

05:41:38.590 --> 05:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:41:42.548 --> 05:41:42.558 align:start position:0%
um it is not right if you're going to
 
05:41:45.708 --> 05:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
want people to attend training then
 
05:41:48.468 --> 05:41:48.478 align:start position:0%
everybody should attend training um I
 
05:41:50.750 --> 05:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
know for our poll
 
05:41:53.190 --> 05:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
workers people working in the polls if
 
05:41:54.670 --> 05:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
they don't attend
 
05:41:56.990 --> 05:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
training they're not working on Election
 
05:42:00.750 --> 05:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
Day um that's just how we do it in
 
05:42:04.110 --> 05:42:04.120 align:start position:0%
Dair um if people want to be paid
 
05:42:05.910 --> 05:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
they're paid if they want to volunteer
 
05:42:08.788 --> 05:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
they volunteer and that's great um but
 
05:42:11.350 --> 05:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
we do have our own training um a lot of
 
05:42:13.468 --> 05:42:13.478 align:start position:0%
the training that we offer is a little
 
05:42:15.070 --> 05:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
bit different than what secretary of
 
05:42:17.910 --> 05:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
state offers because we have pull pads
 
05:42:20.110 --> 05:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
so ballot clerking is something very
 
05:42:22.430 --> 05:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
different in Dairy than it is in towns
 
05:42:27.590 --> 05:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
that don't use pull pads um but we have
 
05:42:28.670 --> 05:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
we have training for our assistant
 
05:42:30.310 --> 05:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
moderators we have training for our
 
05:42:32.270 --> 05:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
greeters we have we have training for
 
05:42:35.070 --> 05:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
all our positions um and that's internal
 
05:42:37.910 --> 05:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
training that we do at Town Hall uh we
 
05:42:40.270 --> 05:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
run training sessions in the morning we
 
05:42:41.990 --> 05:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
run them in the afternoon we run them at
 
05:42:45.150 --> 05:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
night we run them on weekends um we make
 
05:42:48.190 --> 05:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody's trained we had 130
 
05:42:50.910 --> 05:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
pole workers on primary day we're
 
05:42:53.708 --> 05:42:53.718 align:start position:0%
largest polling place in the state so we
 
05:42:56.670 --> 05:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people and we try to do no
 
05:42:59.270 --> 05:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
lines no traffic you know that's seems
 
05:43:01.270 --> 05:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
to be the standard in Dairy no
 
05:43:04.750 --> 05:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
traffic but it's a group effort and we
 
05:43:07.190 --> 05:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
are all part of that
 
05:43:11.030 --> 05:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
group it is not right to try to put even
 
05:43:14.590 --> 05:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
more on just one or two particular
 
05:43:18.030 --> 05:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
elected offices when they're all
 
05:43:20.350 --> 05:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
responsible and everyone needs to do
 
05:43:23.670 --> 05:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
their part and I will take any questions
 
05:43:25.750 --> 05:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
05:43:28.230 --> 05:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um I have no one else signed
 
05:43:29.788 --> 05:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
up to speak
 
05:43:33.468 --> 05:43:33.478 align:start position:0%
right um so if we can get the blue sheet
 
05:43:39.270 --> 05:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
going and online House Bill
 
05:43:43.468 --> 05:43:43.478 align:start position:0%
1381 had 23 in support three opposed
 
05:43:46.788 --> 05:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
zero neutral it is a blank blue sheet so
 
05:43:49.868 --> 05:43:49.878 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the um public
 
05:43:51.708 --> 05:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1381 and I will
 
05:43:54.310 --> 05:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
open up our final public hearing House
 
05:43:56.270 --> 05:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
Bill 1091 I will point out we are only
 
05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
three minutes behind 12 bills three
 
05:44:02.350 --> 05:44:02.360 align:start position:0%
minutes behind now we got that's the
 
05:44:05.990 --> 05:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
real the real hero totally makes up for
 
05:44:09.628 --> 05:44:09.638 align:start position:0%
my comment earlier totally now we
 
05:44:12.310 --> 05:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
got if he can make election law run on
 
05:44:16.630 --> 05:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:16.640 --> 05:44:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

05:44:22.070 --> 05:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:24.150 --> 05:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
anything we just got to read this and
 
05:44:26.990 --> 05:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
then we have train engineer train that's
 
05:44:30.230 --> 05:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
right I guess it could be e
 
05:44:32.030 --> 05:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
and then we get to uh to end with my
 
05:44:34.150 --> 05:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
favorite subject which everybody just
 
05:44:36.390 --> 05:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
gets so excited about it is probably the
 
05:44:38.830 --> 05:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
most interesting thing we handle
 
05:44:38.840 --> 05:44:40.390 align:start position:0%

16 and um this toome that I just handed
 
05:45:26.190 --> 05:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
out to you is the report of the
 
05:45:29.030 --> 05:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that was chaired by
 
05:45:32.070 --> 05:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative qua and attended by rep
 
05:45:35.830 --> 05:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
Ross myself representative mad and
 
05:45:38.868 --> 05:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
representative Ward um over the summer
 
05:45:41.750 --> 05:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
and we wrote this up and it the reason
 
05:45:43.070 --> 05:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
we formed this
 
05:45:45.670 --> 05:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee was
 
05:45:48.510 --> 05:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
because there's been much confusion
 
05:45:51.468 --> 05:45:51.478 align:start position:0%
around our existing um campaign Finance
 
05:45:53.708 --> 05:45:53.718 align:start position:0%
laws which are in chapter
 
05:45:56.948 --> 05:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
6664 um and the attorney general and the
 
05:45:59.390 --> 05:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State um are asked many
 
05:46:02.350 --> 05:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
many many questions about those um
 
05:46:05.788 --> 05:46:05.798 align:start position:0%
Provisions it's been amended hodg Podge
 
05:46:09.110 --> 05:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
wise over the years over the last 20 25
 
05:46:12.948 --> 05:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
years and um they approached us at one
 
05:46:16.430 --> 05:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
point to help us clarify the law and so
 
05:46:19.030 --> 05:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's why the subcommittee was formed
 
05:46:21.628 --> 05:46:21.638 align:start position:0%
and our goals of the subcommittee are
 
05:46:24.310 --> 05:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
set out um there are three of them and
 
05:46:27.150 --> 05:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
they're on page one um of the report
 
05:46:29.030 --> 05:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
that I just gave you it's to review view
 
05:46:31.350 --> 05:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
the current campaign Finance laws as
 
05:46:32.948 --> 05:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
embodied in
 
05:46:36.150 --> 05:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
6684 make specific legislative uh
 
05:46:38.548 --> 05:46:38.558 align:start position:0%
recommendations on the following uh
 
05:46:41.110 --> 05:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
streamlining and improving the current
 
05:46:43.468 --> 05:46:43.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statutes in order to
 
05:46:45.628 --> 05:46:45.638 align:start position:0%
balance the need for
 
05:46:48.590 --> 05:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
transparency and and the need for trying
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
to run an election particularly those of
 
05:46:52.830 --> 05:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
us in the house which are usually doing
 
05:46:55.670 --> 05:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
it on our own and without staff um
 
05:46:58.350 --> 05:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
reducing inconsistencies that exist in
 
05:47:00.590 --> 05:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
the new Hampshire campaign Finance laws
 
05:47:02.788 --> 05:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
and improving the clarity of current New
 
05:47:04.990 --> 05:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire campaign Finance
 
05:47:10.590 --> 05:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
laws so I put together my notes and I
 
05:47:13.910 --> 05:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
wrote the Bill that sub was submitted to
 
05:47:17.310 --> 05:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
you um and have gone through it and I
 
05:47:19.310 --> 05:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
already have some changes and I'm sure
 
05:47:21.910 --> 05:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
all of you will I met I met with the
 
05:47:24.670 --> 05:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office um for two
 
05:47:29.110 --> 05:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
and a half hours yesterday and uh uh uh
 
05:47:31.708 --> 05:47:31.718 align:start position:0%
and uh deputy secretary Hennessy and
 
05:47:34.030 --> 05:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
Budge Fitch uh gave me a lot of notes
 
05:47:36.150 --> 05:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
and stuff to to go forward on I'm
 
05:47:37.628 --> 05:47:37.638 align:start position:0%
waiting to hear from the attorney
 
05:47:39.510 --> 05:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
general with any changes and to make
 
05:47:42.270 --> 05:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
sure that we addressed it because both
 
05:47:43.830 --> 05:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State and the Attorney
 
05:47:46.670 --> 05:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
General came and talked to us and gave
 
05:47:49.190 --> 05:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
us a laundry list of what they wanted us
 
05:47:51.110 --> 05:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
or what they have problems with and what
 
05:47:53.468 --> 05:47:53.478 align:start position:0%
they wanted to clear up so I tried to
 
05:47:56.070 --> 05:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
address that in the bill but as you can
 
05:47:58.230 --> 05:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
see it's fairly long and the devil is in
 
05:48:00.430 --> 05:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
the det details because a lot of the
 
05:48:02.190 --> 05:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
issues were that some of the terms
 
05:48:06.110 --> 05:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
weren't defined well um and uh as you
 
05:48:08.830 --> 05:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
all know I am a former attorney and so I
 
05:48:11.708 --> 05:48:11.718 align:start position:0%
get a little wordy so that's the length
 
05:48:14.430 --> 05:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
of the um some of the definitions are
 
05:48:16.150 --> 05:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
rather long and I looked at other
 
05:48:19.070 --> 05:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
statutes and so there's going to be some
 
05:48:22.510 --> 05:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
more work on this so I would like to ask
 
05:48:24.590 --> 05:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
the chair I mean we'll have the public
 
05:48:26.468 --> 05:48:26.478 align:start position:0%
hearing today but I'd like ask the chair
 
05:48:29.310 --> 05:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
if we can have another subcommittee so
 
05:48:31.350 --> 05:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
that we can work on it further and take
 
05:48:33.070 --> 05:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's comments take the comments
 
05:48:35.430 --> 05:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
of whoever is going to speak today and I
 
05:48:37.750 --> 05:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
want to get the notes and the comments
 
05:48:39.310 --> 05:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
from the Attorney General's office so
 
05:48:41.030 --> 05:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
that we can get a good bill in front of
 
05:48:43.868 --> 05:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
you the next time we all meet and so
 
05:48:46.670 --> 05:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
that we can um uh discuss it at that
 
05:48:50.030 --> 05:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
point so that's really my I'll take
 
05:48:52.110 --> 05:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
questions but I just didn't want to yeah
 
05:48:54.230 --> 05:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
let me before we open up to questions I
 
05:48:55.948 --> 05:48:55.958 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative Lane for
 
05:48:57.910 --> 05:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
working so diligently on this and in
 
05:48:59.230 --> 05:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
good faith
 
05:49:05.030 --> 05:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
um I do think it it is a mess um so what
 
05:49:06.270 --> 05:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
what this was we're going to handle this
 
05:49:08.430 --> 05:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
bill a little differently than we handle
 
05:49:12.830 --> 05:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
most bills um the goal here is to find
 
05:49:15.310 --> 05:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
something that the entire committee the
 
05:49:18.708 --> 05:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
entire committee can agree to to stream
 
05:49:20.868 --> 05:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
as you said to streamline it to make it
 
05:49:23.110 --> 05:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
consistent right we're not talking about
 
05:49:25.350 --> 05:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
major policy changes we handle those
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
individually but making it everything
 
05:49:30.628 --> 05:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
consistent across the board and more
 
05:49:32.830 --> 05:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
uniform so we are going to form a
 
05:49:34.670 --> 05:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
working group for this committee uh for
 
05:49:36.788 --> 05:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
this bill whoever wants to dive into
 
05:49:38.708 --> 05:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
this um is more than welcome to dive
 
05:49:40.868 --> 05:49:40.878 align:start position:0%
into this it's going to get amended I
 
05:49:43.350 --> 05:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
assure you it is going to get amended um
 
05:49:47.150 --> 05:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
because as we cracked open that can of
 
05:49:50.830 --> 05:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
worms a lot of things came out um and it
 
05:49:53.830 --> 05:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
turns out if you change the law peace
 
05:49:56.430 --> 05:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
meal by process over 40 years you get
 
05:49:57.750 --> 05:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
things that don't all match so when
 
05:50:01.350 --> 05:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
we're doing this public hearing um let's
 
05:50:03.548 --> 05:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
let's be cognizant of that's where we're
 
05:50:06.788 --> 05:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
going to head with the bill um so you
 
05:50:08.390 --> 05:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
know if you have questions about intent
 
05:50:09.708 --> 05:50:09.718 align:start position:0%
or that sort of stuff I think those are
 
05:50:11.830 --> 05:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
fair uh but let's try to avoid getting
 
05:50:14.628 --> 05:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
into like gross details um because we're
 
05:50:16.708 --> 05:50:16.718 align:start position:0%
going to handle that as a committee
 
05:50:16.718 --> 05:50:18.788 align:start position:0%
going to handle that as a committee
together

05:50:18.788 --> 05:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:50:21.548 --> 05:50:21.558 align:start position:0%
um yeah focus on the pretty details like
 
05:50:24.390 --> 05:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that my name's on it no um
 
05:50:25.628 --> 05:50:25.638 align:start position:0%
that's right so anyways with that most
 
05:50:27.750 --> 05:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
importantly with that uh happy to have
 
05:50:29.468 --> 05:50:29.478 align:start position:0%
representative take questions but I just
 
05:50:30.948 --> 05:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
wanted the committee to be like in that
 
05:50:34.670 --> 05:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:37.590 --> 05:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
up all right well that was easy okay
 
05:50:40.548 --> 05:50:40.558 align:start position:0%
whoa okay thank you all right uh next up
 
05:50:48.230 --> 05:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:50.430 --> 05:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
Hennessy thank you Mr chair I just want
 
05:50:52.230 --> 05:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
to thank the subcommittee that worked on
 
05:50:54.430 --> 05:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
this over the summertime I wasn't sure
 
05:50:56.948 --> 05:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
when you decided not to have um
 
05:50:58.948 --> 05:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
statutory subcommittees that it was
 
05:51:00.628 --> 05:51:00.638 align:start position:0%
going to work out but I think this is
 
05:51:01.948 --> 05:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
this committee did a great job of
 
05:51:03.708 --> 05:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
showing up I think it was six times over
 
05:51:05.670 --> 05:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
the summer to work on this um so I
 
05:51:08.270 --> 05:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that 664 is a very
 
05:51:10.190 --> 05:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
complicated bill I mean complicated
 
05:51:12.430 --> 05:51:12.440 align:start position:0%
chapter and and I appreciate the amount
 
05:51:14.430 --> 05:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
of time that everyone put into trying to
 
05:51:17.628 --> 05:51:17.638 align:start position:0%
fix this um I will try to attend any
 
05:51:19.948 --> 05:51:19.958 align:start position:0%
subcommittees this um committee has if
 
05:51:22.468 --> 05:51:22.478 align:start position:0%
not I may send out emails with our
 
05:51:24.670 --> 05:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
recommended changes um I appreciate the
 
05:51:26.110 --> 05:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
time that representative Lane spent with
 
05:51:27.788 --> 05:51:27.798 align:start position:0%
our office yesterday to go through I
 
05:51:29.590 --> 05:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
think we only got that through half of
 
05:51:33.350 --> 05:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
her bill um so uh again I appreciate
 
05:51:35.590 --> 05:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
that our our office's goal or at least
 
05:51:38.510 --> 05:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
mine in particular would be that any
 
05:51:40.708 --> 05:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
user of this particularly state
 
05:51:42.830 --> 05:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
representatives state senators anyone
 
05:51:45.270 --> 05:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
who has to file under this would not be
 
05:51:47.510 --> 05:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
in our office asking because they got a
 
05:51:49.468 --> 05:51:49.478 align:start position:0%
letter from the AG's office or they
 
05:51:51.910 --> 05:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know how to do it um I just want
 
05:51:53.910 --> 05:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
the um the requirements to be much more
 
05:51:57.868 --> 05:51:57.878 align:start position:0%
simpler um bullet points ideally um so
 
05:51:59.590 --> 05:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
that people can really understand what
 
05:52:00.750 --> 05:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to report for
 
05:52:00.760 --> 05:52:02.150 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to report for
transparency

05:52:02.150 --> 05:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
05:52:04.788 --> 05:52:04.798 align:start position:0%

I know is is coming forward um I think I
 
05:52:40.708 --> 05:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
I just want to sort of thank
 
05:52:43.190 --> 05:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative qua for leading the
 
05:52:45.150 --> 05:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
committee the subcommittee uh
 
05:52:47.628 --> 05:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
representative Lang Barry Ward and Mirad
 
05:52:50.788 --> 05:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
for cont comp like six or seven hours I
 
05:52:53.030 --> 05:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
sat through many of these hearings many
 
05:52:55.230 --> 05:52:55.240 align:start position:0%
members of the public set through um
 
05:52:57.468 --> 05:52:57.478 align:start position:0%
this but they took the time to read
 
05:53:01.150 --> 05:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
through 64 line by line making
 
05:53:03.868 --> 05:53:03.878 align:start position:0%
amendments um figuring out where the
 
05:53:05.948 --> 05:53:05.958 align:start position:0%
confusing confusing parts of the
 
05:53:08.788 --> 05:53:08.798 align:start position:0%
reporting is putting hours in to make
 
05:53:11.230 --> 05:53:11.240 align:start position:0%
the law as clear as possible and I that
 
05:53:13.948 --> 05:53:13.958 align:start position:0%
is a an amazing goal to do that in a
 
05:53:17.150 --> 05:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
bipartisan fashion um and Clarity on
 
05:53:19.030 --> 05:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance is critical for public
 
05:53:20.670 --> 05:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
confidence in elected officials and
 
05:53:22.670 --> 05:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
voters deserve the
 
05:53:27.230 --> 05:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
transparency um I do want to make some
 
05:53:30.868 --> 05:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
suggestions cuz that's what I do um so
 
05:53:34.948 --> 05:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
on page two line 28 when we talk about
 
05:53:37.510 --> 05:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
political advertisement I think it would
 
05:53:40.030 --> 05:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
be important for that definition to be
 
05:53:42.070 --> 05:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
also looped in with the definition of
 
05:53:44.990 --> 05:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
comp communication and expenditures
 
05:53:46.230 --> 05:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
because right now political
 
05:53:48.948 --> 05:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
advertisement should be should
 
05:53:52.708 --> 05:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
also um talk you know any expenditure
 
05:53:54.430 --> 05:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
made on behalf of a candidate so
 
05:53:57.190 --> 05:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about how to Loop those in so
 
05:54:00.948 --> 05:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
that the disclos Ure requirements under
 
05:54:03.708 --> 05:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
66414 apply to all political
 
05:54:07.070 --> 05:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
advertisements so I would look at um the
 
05:54:09.510 --> 05:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
definition of political
 
05:54:13.430 --> 05:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
advertisement on page um three line
 
05:54:16.948 --> 05:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
nine um the definition of expenditure I
 
05:54:18.270 --> 05:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
know this committee looked at the
 
05:54:21.070 --> 05:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
definition of expenditure a lot um and I
 
05:54:25.590 --> 05:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
think um the intent here is is really to
 
05:54:27.350 --> 05:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's a comprehensive
 
05:54:29.310 --> 05:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
definition of what a political
 
05:54:31.350 --> 05:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
expenditure an exp a campaign
 
05:54:34.670 --> 05:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
expenditure is um including ads uh to
 
05:54:37.548 --> 05:54:37.558 align:start position:0%
influence the words um but the the
 
05:54:39.830 --> 05:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
problem with sort of only using the
 
05:54:42.670 --> 05:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
magic words of vote for and vote against
 
05:54:45.788 --> 05:54:45.798 align:start position:0%
um you also have to uh expand that to
 
05:54:48.310 --> 05:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
include the express advocacy which is in
 
05:54:49.990 --> 05:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
the definition of an
 
05:54:53.390 --> 05:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
election um with I.E um the definition
 
05:54:55.390 --> 05:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
of election arean communication but also
 
05:54:58.390 --> 05:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
the functional equivalent of Express
 
05:55:01.510 --> 05:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
advocacy and any communication promoting
 
05:55:03.590 --> 05:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
supporting attacking or opposing
 
05:55:06.868 --> 05:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
candidates or measures um so that
 
05:55:10.070 --> 05:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
definition of exp expenditures could be
 
05:55:14.230 --> 05:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
improved for clarification purposes um
 
05:55:16.468 --> 05:55:16.478 align:start position:0%
on page
 
05:55:21.708 --> 05:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
four um line five um independent
 
05:55:24.390 --> 05:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures Miss can I pause your fast
 
05:55:25.510 --> 05:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
these all these changes you're
 
05:55:27.150 --> 05:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
suggesting are they in Rewritten
 
05:55:28.948 --> 05:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
testimony no okay all right continue
 
05:55:30.548 --> 05:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
then I know I need to know what
 
05:55:32.230 --> 05:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
diligence what what diligence I needed
 
05:55:34.190 --> 05:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
to take notes on thank you sorry they're
 
05:55:36.750 --> 05:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
not uh sorry I I can write them out up
 
05:55:38.548 --> 05:55:38.558 align:start position:0%
and email them if that would be helpful
 
05:55:41.948 --> 05:55:41.958 align:start position:0%
yes um so page four line five um the
 
05:55:44.468 --> 05:55:44.478 align:start position:0%
independent expenditures there's a great
 
05:55:47.750 --> 05:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh handout on coordination laws um from
 
05:55:49.510 --> 05:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
what should be independent of a
 
05:55:51.110 --> 05:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
candidate expenditures and those that
 
05:55:54.070 --> 05:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
are independent um so I think adding
 
05:55:56.788 --> 05:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
language in that section around
 
05:55:58.590 --> 05:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
coordination and what does mean to
 
05:56:00.990 --> 05:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
coordinate um and what does it mean to
 
05:56:02.750 --> 05:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
be independent it would be really
 
05:56:05.788 --> 05:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
helpful in that section and then one
 
05:56:09.468 --> 05:56:09.478 align:start position:0%
other minor suggestion is Page um six
 
05:56:12.628 --> 05:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
line 13 um when we talk about
 
05:56:14.510 --> 05:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
registration requirements and I think
 
05:56:16.150 --> 05:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and Secretary of
 
05:56:18.390 --> 05:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
State also spoke about this there's a
 
05:56:19.510 --> 05:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
bunch of different triggers and
 
05:56:21.628 --> 05:56:21.638 align:start position:0%

you're an independent expenditure you
 
05:56:28.948 --> 05:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
file only after and expenditure has been
 
05:56:31.150 --> 05:56:31.160 align:start position:0%

05:56:35.430 --> 05:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
requirements um come into a
 
05:56:38.468 --> 05:56:38.478 align:start position:0%
more easier to understand and clarify
 
05:56:40.590 --> 05:56:40.600 align:start position:0%

05:56:44.628 --> 05:56:44.638 align:start position:0%

um representation and also like in Maine
 
05:56:53.708 --> 05:56:53.718 align:start position:0%
for example they use this major purpose
 
05:56:56.510 --> 05:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
to Define groups and I think that uh

06:07:28.670 --> 06:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:07:32.070 --> 06:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh went through and identified
 
06:07:33.468 --> 06:07:33.478 align:start position:0%
different things from the testimony
 
06:07:34.948 --> 06:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
original sponsor did most of the work
 
06:07:36.628 --> 06:07:36.638 align:start position:0%
just let me give credit where credit is

concerns that were raised during
 
06:07:43.990 --> 06:07:44.000 align:start position:0%

by the Secretary of State's office and
 
06:07:52.270 --> 06:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
that was also addressed so there are
 
06:07:57.230 --> 06:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
some um about about five changes total
 
06:08:00.390 --> 06:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
um to this um compared to the original
 
06:08:05.590 --> 06:08:05.600 align:start position:0%

a housekeeping Amendment um the original

Bill used references to rsas that were
 
06:14:18.510 --> 06:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
in the old election manual and so the
 
06:14:20.548 --> 06:14:20.558 align:start position:0%
amendment just updates them to the
 
06:14:25.270 --> 06:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
purple election law manual which is uh
 
06:14:31.430 --> 06:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
20242 25 laws and so for example there's
 
06:14:35.548 --> 06:14:35.558 align:start position:0%
a few little um on line
 
06:14:40.468 --> 06:14:40.478 align:start position:0%
two uh it says amend RSA 664 colon 4
 
06:14:43.788 --> 06:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 3 was changed to Roman
 
06:14:48.670 --> 06:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
numeral 2 on line three the it was also
 
06:14:52.548 --> 06:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
changed to Roman numeral 2 on line 11 it
 
06:14:55.150 --> 06:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
was also changed to read uh Roman
 
06:14:59.390 --> 06:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
numeral 2 and then on line 16 the RSA
 
06:15:04.350 --> 06:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
would change to read 664 colon 4 Roman
 
06:15:04.360 --> 06:15:05.750 align:start position:0%
would change to read 664 colon 4 Roman
numeral

06:15:05.750 --> 06:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
06:15:07.708 --> 06:15:07.718 align:start position:0%

06:23:27.788 --> 06:23:27.798 align:start position:0%
Bill hearing the Secretary of State's
 
06:23:29.990 --> 06:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
office had suggested six years and
 
06:23:31.868 --> 06:23:31.878 align:start position:0%
there's still uh debate amongst the
 
06:23:34.548 --> 06:23:34.558 align:start position:0%
Democratic committee or caucus uh over
 
06:23:36.670 --> 06:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
how we want to proceed with this bill uh
 
06:23:37.750 --> 06:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
I think it would be good to have
 
06:23:39.628 --> 06:23:39.638 align:start position:0%
additional information looking at
 
06:23:42.830 --> 06:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
exactly uh how many voters are purged
 
06:23:44.628 --> 06:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
for that four-year period versus the
 
06:23:46.350 --> 06:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
six-year period so that we can make the
 
06:23:48.590 --> 06:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
best decision possible moving forward
 
06:23:48.600 --> 06:23:50.548 align:start position:0%

06:23:57.788 --> 06:23:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:59.510 --> 06:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Mirad I'd be curious to
 
06:24:01.548 --> 06:24:01.558 align:start position:0%
know whether members of your caucus
 
06:24:02.948 --> 06:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
might be interested in participating in
 
06:24:08.230 --> 06:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
that uh study um I I can tell you this I
 
06:24:10.468 --> 06:24:10.478 align:start position:0%
have thought about this bill um I was
 
06:24:12.230 --> 06:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
actually thanking the sponsor for it
 
06:24:12.240 --> 06:24:15.030 align:start position:0%
actually thanking the sponsor for it
earlier

06:24:15.030 --> 06:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
06:24:18.830 --> 06:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
um every 10 years we purge out 25% of
 
06:24:18.840 --> 06:24:21.548 align:start position:0%
um every 10 years we purge out 25% of
our

06:24:21.548 --> 06:24:21.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:26.270 --> 06:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
voters it creates a lot of
 
06:24:29.230 --> 06:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
it creates a lot of anxiety when that
 
06:24:32.788 --> 06:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
happens um on both sides of the aisle um
 
06:24:34.510 --> 06:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
people that want the voter roles to
 
06:24:37.548 --> 06:24:37.558 align:start position:0%
remain unchanged basically forever and
 
06:24:42.030 --> 06:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
those who want to do like daily purchase
 
06:24:46.310 --> 06:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
um I think four years and every four
 
06:24:48.510 --> 06:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
years looking back four years is an
 
06:24:50.990 --> 06:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate Middle Ground if if I was
 
06:24:53.548 --> 06:24:53.558 align:start position:0%
the the governor um or dictator or
 
06:24:55.510 --> 06:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
whatever I got to pick um it would be
 
06:24:59.910 --> 06:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
every year looking back five years um so
 
06:25:03.430 --> 06:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
I think 44 is probably where our caucus
 
06:25:05.990 --> 06:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
is going to end up in general um I don't
 
06:25:09.468 --> 06:25:09.478 align:start position:0%
see the need to study this honestly so
 
06:25:11.110 --> 06:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting against the motion of V
 
06:25:13.270 --> 06:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
to study I think we can have this fight
 
06:25:16.230 --> 06:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
on the floor and I look forward to
 
06:25:19.110 --> 06:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
it yes representative weing yeah there
 
06:25:21.350 --> 06:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
there's also a Senate Bill similar
 
06:25:26.548 --> 06:25:26.558 align:start position:0%
nature uh I don't know um apparently the
 
06:25:29.150 --> 06:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
testimony changed to five
 
06:25:32.310 --> 06:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
years um for the Senate but uh so we
 
06:25:34.548 --> 06:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
will have another opportunity to look at
 
06:25:36.910 --> 06:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
this as well when we review the Senate
 
06:25:39.270 --> 06:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
bill I we never know what the mysteries
 
06:25:41.230 --> 06:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
of the other wall will do true
 
06:25:41.240 --> 06:25:42.270 align:start position:0%
of the other wall will do true
representative

06:25:42.270 --> 06:25:42.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:25:45.270 --> 06:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
vernham thank you um I just wanted to
 
06:25:47.390 --> 06:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that also we heard
 
06:25:49.628 --> 06:25:49.638 align:start position:0%
from the uh representative the clerk's
 
06:25:52.750 --> 06:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
Association who was for the four years
 
06:25:54.670 --> 06:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
uh those are people that he's
 
06:25:56.190 --> 06:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
representing those who are actually
 
06:25:58.190 --> 06:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with this on a day-to-day year
 
06:26:00.910 --> 06:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
toe and he really liked this the four
 
06:26:04.190 --> 06:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
years so I support it and I will point
 
06:26:06.390 --> 06:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
out that every four years the way the
 
06:26:08.830 --> 06:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
schedule set up will always include a
 
06:26:10.390 --> 06:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
presidential election which are high
 
06:26:14.230 --> 06:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
just High turnout um so the the uh the
 
06:26:15.788 --> 06:26:15.798 align:start position:0%
question that I proposition when it
 
06:26:17.430 --> 06:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
comes to these voter roll purges which
 
06:26:20.830 --> 06:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
have historically been used um by Bad
 
06:26:22.430 --> 06:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
actors I don't believe this is a bad
 
06:26:26.230 --> 06:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
actor Bill um is you know if somebody
 
06:26:29.310 --> 06:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
goes four years without voting you know
 
06:26:31.150 --> 06:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
why is it okay to take them off every 10
 
06:26:33.750 --> 06:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
years but it's not okay to do it every
 
06:26:35.468 --> 06:26:35.478 align:start position:0%
four years like it just doesn't the
 
06:26:37.270 --> 06:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
logic doesn't line up if you can do it
 
06:26:38.990 --> 06:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
every every 10 years why can't you do it
 
06:26:41.310 --> 06:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
every four years so the way this sets up
 
06:26:42.670 --> 06:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
it always have a presidential election
 
06:26:44.868 --> 06:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
those are high turnouts in the high 70s
 
06:26:46.030 --> 06:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting against the motion of
 
06:26:47.510 --> 06:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
interm study because as you can probably
 
06:26:50.030 --> 06:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
tell we I'm already if it was up to me
 
06:26:51.270 --> 06:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
like said it was me to be every year
 
06:26:53.548 --> 06:26:53.558 align:start position:0%
looking back five years so we've already
 
06:26:55.230 --> 06:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
we've already come off of I think where
 
06:26:57.230 --> 06:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
we would like to be representative
 
06:26:59.628 --> 06:26:59.638 align:start position:0%
Lane yes I think in light of the
 
06:27:02.190 --> 06:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
discussion I would ask representative
 
06:27:05.230 --> 06:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
Heath whether he wanted to withdraw his
 
06:27:07.350 --> 06:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
motion yeah that that's fine I'll
 
06:27:08.590 --> 06:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
withdraw thank
 
06:27:11.150 --> 06:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
you the motion is withdrawn I appreciate
 
06:27:12.230 --> 06:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
the representative withdrawing his
 
06:27:15.270 --> 06:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
motion with that um House Bill 1369 will
 
06:27:17.230 --> 06:27:17.240 align:start position:0%

housekeeping bill um and like the other
 
06:28:51.468 --> 06:28:51.478 align:start position:0%
one the uh the wrong uh Roman numeral
 
06:28:54.670 --> 06:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
was used in line uh lines eight all the
 
06:28:57.948 --> 06:28:57.958 align:start position:0%
way through the bill anytime that uh
 
06:29:00.270 --> 06:29:00.280 align:start position:0%
statute was referenced so it's been
 
06:29:03.070 --> 06:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
changed to Roman numeral 4 and that's
 
06:29:05.070 --> 06:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
there have been no substantive changes
 
06:29:08.750 --> 06:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
those were the only changes how dare you
 
06:29:11.628 --> 06:29:11.638 align:start position:0%
um any discussion on the
 
06:29:13.990 --> 06:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
06:29:17.548 --> 06:29:17.558 align:start position:0%
wey uh just um after the wonderful
 
06:29:19.990 --> 06:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing earlier on House Bill
 
06:29:23.350 --> 06:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
1091 which completely
 
06:29:26.350 --> 06:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
revamps uh RS say
 
06:29:26.360 --> 06:29:29.548 align:start position:0%
revamps uh RS say
664

06:29:29.548 --> 06:29:29.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:33.070 --> 06:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
um I just um I wonder if this becomes
 
06:29:36.750 --> 06:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
out of context I guess
 
06:29:40.670 --> 06:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
um it could um we have to pass they have
 
06:29:43.350 --> 06:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
they they basically look at what we pass
 
06:29:46.750 --> 06:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
and they reassemble it um so you know it
 
06:29:49.030 --> 06:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
depends on what we passed last so if
 
06:29:52.548 --> 06:29:52.558 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1091 came out later it would
 
06:29:54.628 --> 06:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
override what we did here um but there's
 
06:29:56.230 --> 06:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
no guarantees we handle it one piece at
 
06:29:58.868 --> 06:29:58.878 align:start position:0%
a time but as I said earlier
 
06:30:01.708 --> 06:30:01.718 align:start position:0%
uh revisions are how
 
06:30:06.110 --> 06:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
664 got to its current shape um that's
 
06:30:08.070 --> 06:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
not a statement about this one in
 
06:30:10.150 --> 06:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
particular but it's just that's how it
 
06:30:11.910 --> 06:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
happens so we're on disc but it's a
 
06:30:13.708 --> 06:30:13.718 align:start position:0%
great question we're on discussion of
 
06:30:17.670 --> 06:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
