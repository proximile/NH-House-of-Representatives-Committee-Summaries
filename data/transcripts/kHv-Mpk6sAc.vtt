to make it instead of a mandatory
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
provision that
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations shall also
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
offer 25
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
cent tickets 25 cent and 50 cent tickets
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
to make the 25 cent part of the
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
an option for the organizations and
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
my sense was that uh that
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
many members of the committee thought
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
that was a good idea so i
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
my question is what's become of that or
 
00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.590 align:start position:0%
my question is what's become of that or
why

00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
why not take the time to make that
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
amendment if there is that kind of
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative i
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
remember the conversation but nobody
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
came uh to the forefront with
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
with the uh with the amendment and uh
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
i know at least my position um
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
is that just just these changes are
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
minimal changes in will be beneficial to
 
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.390 align:start position:0%
minimal changes in will be beneficial to
the

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
any any further discussion on senate
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
bill 22.
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
mr chair representative thank you
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
i did produce such an amendment because
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh the charities under our current law
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
by mistake
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
are required to buy the 25 cent tickets
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
even though
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
they aren't going to use them and this
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
was brought forward to us
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
by someone who does represent the paper
 
00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.269 align:start position:0%
by someone who does represent the paper
tickets

00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
on but i put that in an amendment which
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
also got rid of
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
sections one and two because i fervently
 
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:17.909 align:start position:0%
sections one and two because i fervently
believe

00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
that this kind of thing ought to be done
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
by the commission
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
and because since i've been around this
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
long i know that the legislative intent
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
very clearly was that these machines
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
dispensers and the i am
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
offended by the fact that the lottery
 
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.430 align:start position:0%
offended by the fact that the lottery
commission

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
on changed them over to non-dispensers
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
already and that this the sections one
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
and two are just
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
affirming in law of what they did by
 
00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:50.149 align:start position:0%
affirming in law of what they did by
themselves

00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so the amendment language is
 
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:53.669 align:start position:0%
thank you so the amendment language is
written

00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to wait for a future time
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
on you could just pull that out
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
but it is connected at the moment with
 
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.269 align:start position:0%
but it is connected at the moment with
repealing

00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
repealing
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
sections one and two thank you had you
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
had an amendment drawn up for that yes i
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
told you that
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh i can i'm
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
sorry i i did it a couple of weeks ago
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
and then i forgot about it
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
so i can i could share it on the screen
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
if i was able to but i could also read
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
you muted yourself i
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
i pulled it up this morning on
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
but on i would need to
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
to stop being able to talk to you in
 
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.390 align:start position:0%
to stop being able to talk to you in
order

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
to to read it to you i think
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
or maybe i can just split my screen do
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
you want me to do that
 
00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
let's try it it's the same language
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
janine can she
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
norm i i actually have the language from
 
00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.269 align:start position:0%
norm i i actually have the language from
tyler

00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
tyler
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
if if that would make it quicker for me
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
to read it
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
okay um oh dear if
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
um when four can give you the share
 
00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:49.669 align:start position:0%
um when four can give you the share
screen

00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
permissions are there permissions are
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
on can i do that at this point share
 
00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:23.830 align:start position:0%
on can i do that at this point share
screen

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.950 align:start position:0%
screen
yes

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
would it help with representative romney
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
here i found it
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
um i thought i found it
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
that scroll there let's scroll up a
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
little bit you're there
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
can everyone else see it i can see it
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
authors can see it too so
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
tell us essentially what it does now
 
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:19.750 align:start position:0%
tell us essentially what it does now
yeah

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
on all it does is it says
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh the existing current language is that
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
tickets shall either be
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
50 cents or oh dear
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
i can't see it well enough because this
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
thing is on here
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
get myself out of there okay
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh shall be either 50 cents or
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
one dollar on it was
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
amended in the bill to say
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
the bill says 25 on
 
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
shall not exceed one dollar
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
on but where tickets where a charitable
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
organization offers one dollar tickets
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
for sale the charitable organization so
 
00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.190 align:start position:0%
for sale the charitable organization so
often

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
often
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
also offer 25 and 50 cent tickets for
 
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:27.669 align:start position:0%
also offer 25 and 50 cent tickets for
sale

00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
sale
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
and that's the problem um so this one
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
says that the price shall not exceed one
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
dollar so it could be
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
25 cents uh providing that where
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
one dollar tickets are for sale the
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
charitable organization shall also
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
offer 50 tickets for sale which then
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
makes the 25 cents
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
possible but optional it would also make
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
one cent
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
what tyler clark said was that very
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh there are some organizations that
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
use the 25 cent ticket but very few of
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
them and the other ones are required to
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
buy it even though they aren't going to
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
use it
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
so your amendment eliminates one
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
you saw the problem from my point of
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
view it's a problem for most people's
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
you want to make a motion on your
 
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.590 align:start position:0%
you want to make a motion on your
amendment

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
on no because i know it's going to lose
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
okay mr chair can you speak
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
your amendment is not to be considered
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
anymore then it's not going to make a
 
00:31:46.159 --> 00:31:47.509 align:start position:0%
anymore then it's not going to make a
motion

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
section that i just read without the
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
rest of it
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
and then on come back
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
when we do sp3 and do this one
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
i don't know what it advances us to
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%

yes i uh you know i reread the language
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
and i was a little confused but the way
 
00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:26.389 align:start position:0%
and i was a little confused but the way
it's

00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's being uh discussed now
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
it actually makes some sense so i have
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
no problem with
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
us uh delaying this this vote
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
and uh waiting for next week or the
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
following week to executives bill
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
um with just the this amendment for the
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
the third section of the bill only and
 
00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:51.190 align:start position:0%
the third section of the bill only and
uh

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
so um and by the way
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
just we keep on talking about the the
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
charitable the charitable gaming
 
00:32:58.399 --> 00:32:59.509 align:start position:0%
charitable the charitable gaming
committee

00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
i just double checked that committee
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
goes until 22.
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
so it's more than a year committee it's
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh like a year and a half committee so
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh there's certain things here that we
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to delay that long
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
but uh so but i i would suggest i
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
i would agree with representative valmie
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
that we we delay the vote on this
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
and that we uh if she wants to do that
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
amendment or
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
i can do it we can we can
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
have this amendment uh to fix this
 
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.310 align:start position:0%
have this amendment uh to fix this
language

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
and uh and then move forward um
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know in a week or two representative
 
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.789 align:start position:0%

dessert yeah just to speak to that just
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair um you know the more
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
i look at this overall bill
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
it really is a housekeeping bill uh
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
with one change but i'll get back to
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
that when we talk about the bill itself
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
um uh but through our deliberations
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh charlie mcintyre asked that i uh file
 
00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.270 align:start position:0%
uh charlie mcintyre asked that i uh file
this

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
amendment for situations in which
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
a charity charitable organization
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't fall into one of the
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate buckets uh to give some
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
latitude and we heard some testimony
 
00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:28.550 align:start position:0%
latitude and we heard some testimony
from

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
lisa allen i think her name was on her
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
organization at a restaurant chain
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
that also has a charitable arm feed new
 
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.310 align:start position:0%
that also has a charitable arm feed new
hampshire

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
and the way that what the amendment
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
basically does is it says
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
uh you know the exception is it can
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
be made by the executive director of the
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
lottery uh but the organization
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
had to be established with the
 
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
charitable trust unit of the attorney
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
and has been in existence for a period
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
of two years prior to the application
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
the charitable works of the organization
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
take place primarily in the state of new
 
00:38:03.839 --> 00:38:04.950 align:start position:0%
take place primarily in the state of new
hampshire

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
and see all charitable gaming revenue
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
raised by the organization shall be used
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
to benefit the state of new hampshire
 
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
and its residents
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
there's some things i want to mention
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
but uh they're really on the bill part
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh and that uh and maybe i'll say a bit
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
of it here
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
what what the original bill does is
 
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
it it for for both
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
charitable games of chance which is
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
terrible gaming
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
and for bingo and uh lucky seven
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
the build uh re-codifies the language
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
that already exists for the most part
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
and it makes the
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
makes the charitable uh gaming language
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
and the bingo language
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
identical okay
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
and in terms of the definition of what a
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
charitable organization
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
is and uh
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
and and i i i i want to get ahead of
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
myself in terms of talking about the
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh but all this does is it gives
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
a little attitude for an exception
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh to be made as long as those three
 
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.589 align:start position:0%
uh to be made as long as those three
criteria

00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
are met uh by the uh by the organization
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
so that is basically the amendment
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
saying then i'll ask the clerk to call
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
the vote on the amendment mr chairman
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
there are two people with their hands up
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
um okay i didn't see that representative
 
00:39:45.839 --> 00:39:47.829 align:start position:0%
um okay i didn't see that representative
ames

00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
ames
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
i think representative schamberg had his
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you mr
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
chairman mr representative
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh when you said the money shall be used
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh state and the citizens residents of
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
if an organization raises the money do
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
they have to expend it outside their
 
00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:19.270 align:start position:0%
they have to expend it outside their
organization

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
or can they just spend it within their
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh i i i think it's outside
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's raising money for their
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
organization most of these i mean we got
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
fraternal organizations
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
usually they exist to support uh
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
charities if you will uh uh
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
but again this this language is
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
consistent with
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh the way we're defining charitable
 
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.309 align:start position:0%
uh the way we're defining charitable
organizations

00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
i guess just a couple of questions for
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative romney really
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
the organization has to be in existence
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
for a period of at least two years
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
right and the bill is
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
the reasons that i don't think i've ever
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
been fully explained moving
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
the existing two-year requirement down
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
to one year
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
so that would be one of the waivers it's
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
kind of a weird waiver it's increasing
 
00:41:32.839 --> 00:41:33.990 align:start position:0%
kind of a weird waiver it's increasing
the

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
restriction but um why
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
why the two years one year why any of
 
00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.390 align:start position:0%
why the two years one year why any of
this

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
well that that's the you hit on one of
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
the changes of the bill
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
that from current law is moving the
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
the period the waiting period from uh
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
one uh from uh two years to one year
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh and uh
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
it was felt i guess by by lottery that
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
this this was a more appropriate
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
waiting period uh and i and then
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
my my thinking was that they kept it at
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
two years for the exception because it's
 
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.109 align:start position:0%
two years for the exception because it's
an

00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
exception uh just to make it a little
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
more difficult
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
and give them more time to to evaluate
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
that charity okay
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
i can understand that the um
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
one of my difficulties with this is that
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
there were several quests
 
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
there were other questions that were
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
raised in the
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
when we were originally dealing with
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
this bill which we never got back to as
 
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.309 align:start position:0%
this bill which we never got back to as
a

00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
committee maybe it's my fault for not
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
raising them but
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh we never really had the kind of
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
review that
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
i think we used to do
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
another another issue is but i guess i'm
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
getting over onto that i'm getting over
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
under the bill itself and maybe i
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't uh yeah i was going to respond
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
to the bill itself actually
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
yeah not to that um any further
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
i see no hands um then representative
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%

now we are on the bill as amended
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
any discussion yes i'd like to speak to
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative so uh
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
there's four parts of the bill the first
 
00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.150 align:start position:0%
there's four parts of the bill the first
part

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
is something that we've already uh
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
within another bill that we already
 
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.230 align:start position:0%
within another bill that we already
voted

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
voted
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
on so that is redundant but that'll be
 
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
handled by uh if passed it'll be
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
handled by the uh enrollment process
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh what it does is it it it it we really
 
00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.510 align:start position:0%
uh what it does is it it it it we really
recodifies

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
recodifies
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
a bit the uh the definitions of what
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
charity is
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
and making the the the definition of a
 
00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:34.790 align:start position:0%
and making the the the definition of a
charity

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
charity
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
the same for games of chance as well as
 
00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.390 align:start position:0%
the same for games of chance as well as
for

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh bingo and unlucky seven so
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
what we got hung up on and i got hung up
 
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.470 align:start position:0%
what we got hung up on and i got hung up
on

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
was all those 501 c codes
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
and uh the more i studied this the last
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
couple of uh last week
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
it was clear it became clearer to me
 
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.630 align:start position:0%
it was clear it became clearer to me
that

00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
we weren't creating these codes as new
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
these these codes already existed in the
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh first off and it's just been
 
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.150 align:start position:0%
uh first off and it's just been
rearranged

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
rearranged
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh within the within the document
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.390 align:start position:0%
but the real definition of charitable
organization

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
is as it says means any bona fide
 
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:17.910 align:start position:0%
is as it says means any bona fide
religious

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
religious
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
charitable civic veterans or fraternal
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
or church organization
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
including police in firemen's
 
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.750 align:start position:0%
including police in firemen's
organizations

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
and houses of worship which shall have
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
been registered
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
with the secretary of state for at least
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
they used to say two years
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
and the change is made to one year and
 
00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:36.870 align:start position:0%
and the change is made to one year and
then

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
it gives then you also have to meet the
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
one through four underneath it uh
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
and so you have to be you could be a
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
general organization
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
but you have to be you have to have a
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
document that your organization has a
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
tax-exempt status under the internal
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
revenue code
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
one of those you know six
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
six codes there in those six codes
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
are other things like we talked about in
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
in in committee
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know some of these may be uh
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
political organizations and things like
 
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.309 align:start position:0%
political organizations and things like
that

00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
but that's that's what they did in the
 
00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.150 align:start position:0%
but that's that's what they did in the
original

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
when they created this original law is
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
they said well
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
we it has to be a charitable
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
organization and as above
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
but it has to be also registered with
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
the internally
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
revenue code as a non-uh tax-exempt
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
as long as it falls under one of those
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
codes so
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh we're not creating anything new here
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
i mean this has always been the way
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
it has been although i i take that back
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
it's that it always was that way in the
 
00:47:45.839 --> 00:47:46.630 align:start position:0%
it's that it always was that way in the
bingo

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
bingo
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
lucky seven language but now they're
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
putting that same language to make the
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
two languages the same
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
they're putting it into the charitable
 
00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.230 align:start position:0%
they're putting it into the charitable
uh

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
organization the game's chance statutes
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
so that's really the the big change and
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
that to me is a housekeeping thing that
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
was done uh with the exception of
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
changing it to one year
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh from the two and then uh the the
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
the uh third thing it did was uh
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh i guess in the fourth paragraph on
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
it it it was a uh everywhere where there
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
was a
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
reference to lottery they changed the
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
word to commission
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
because that was misused if you recall i
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
think we discussed
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
this last year and it wasn't another
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
bill that didn't make it through the
 
00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.430 align:start position:0%
bill that didn't make it through the
process

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's a the commission is actually
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
commissioned meaning
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
the the winnings the commission that the
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
organization got
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
not the lottery so so wherever you see
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
lottery commission
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
they they changed it to just they took
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
out lottery and it was
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
just uh commission and then the
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
the final uh the final change
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
was in the definition of a deal with
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
lucky seven
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
and it just says deal means a single
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
game of
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
uncirculated lucky seven tickets bearing
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
a serial number
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
so those were the four things that the
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill did uh i would i would
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
i would argue that most of these are
 
00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.950 align:start position:0%
i would argue that most of these are
housekeeping

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh and uh that's why i
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think we should wait for
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
our commission to be done uh which would
 
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.270 align:start position:0%
our commission to be done uh which would
be

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
you know not until november of 22
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
so probably a year and a half away so
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
that's why i
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
i thought it was wise to just move
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
forward with this and
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we can't discuss some of
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
these things in the commission
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
but i think we should just move forward
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ames followed
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
okay i'll begin again um sorry about
 
00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.349 align:start position:0%
okay i'll begin again um sorry about
that

00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh to representative
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
romney for
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
all the work that has gone into this um
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
i i basically agree i agree
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
that we can go forward with this
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
i think the uh the biggest issue
 
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's uh that needs further work is
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
is the question of what is a charitable
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
organization what's the definition going
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
that can be probed and worked on
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
by the commission that we all hope will
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
be established
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
or it's a committee isn't it joint
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee yes
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
yeah committee um and
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh that uh
 
00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:07.950 align:start position:0%
hopefully hopefully that committee will
 
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:09.430 align:start position:0%
hopefully hopefully that committee will

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
bring things together and deal with this
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
string of irc
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
internal revenue code sections in a
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
coherent way
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
that makes sense and make sure that that
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
listing those
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
makes sense for our purposes um
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
and uh and then there were other issues
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
that i remember raising
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
when we started our look at this bill
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
maintaining a current list of bona fide
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
members is a requirement
 
00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:40.030 align:start position:0%
is that an appropriate requirement
 
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:41.109 align:start position:0%
is that an appropriate requirement

00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure but it's i think it's
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
nothing new and we need to
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
look at that and i hopefully this
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
committee will look at that among other
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
larger issues too that that committee
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
will look at
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
so i guess i'm all of that is to say
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
um say okay for this
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
looking at this as a
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
consolidation of bringing together
 
00:52:05.359 --> 00:52:07.030 align:start position:0%
consolidation of bringing together
concepts

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
concepts
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
between all games of chance and bingo
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
and lucky seven
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
um so that's it okay uh representative
 
00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:15.349 align:start position:0%
um so that's it okay uh representative
alame

00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
alame
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
followed by representing earlier thank
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:23.349 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
on

00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
i think that there was there seemed to
 
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
be a major problem
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
which is being uh in for not being
 
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.430 align:start position:0%
which is being uh in for not being
enforced

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
about maintain a current list of bona
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
fide members for a number of charities
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
but on i
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
basically we have not done
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
a thorough re-examination of charitable
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
gaming regulation
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
since it was started on
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
and when it was started it did not
 
00:52:56.559 --> 00:52:57.349 align:start position:0%
and when it was started it did not
include

00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
machine gaming machine gaming is a lot
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
more addictive
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
our regulation seems to consist only of
 
00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:06.790 align:start position:0%
our regulation seems to consist only of
financial

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
financial
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
that is financial of the gaming
 
00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:10.710 align:start position:0%
that is financial of the gaming
organization

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
itself so that the state and the
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
charities get their money
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
on it does not include the problem of
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
the addiction part of charitable gaming
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
as it is now called in this state uh
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
everywhere else it's called casino
 
00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.549 align:start position:0%
everywhere else it's called casino
gaming

00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot more regulation and it
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
provides a lot more money to the state
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
on and um
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's a very different bowl of wax than
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
what on
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
the we've got regulations for and
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
so i am opposed to this
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
bill passing uh
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
especially until there is an
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
actual study of uh what needs to be done
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
for regulation charitable gaming we
 
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:00.549 align:start position:0%
for regulation charitable gaming we
don't

00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
even know if all the parts
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
of this i presume that all the parts of
 
00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:07.910 align:start position:0%
of this i presume that all the parts of
this

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
enforced in some way by the lottery
 
00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.390 align:start position:0%
enforced in some way by the lottery
commission

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
but the parts of it that have to do with
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
on where the money
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
is actually going uh
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
is something that has to be looked at by
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
that commission
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh who who is deciding where
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
where the money goes the the one that we
 
00:54:36.079 --> 00:54:36.549 align:start position:0%
where the money goes the the one that we
just

00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we just passed could
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
allow for some major difficulties
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
since the attorney general's office
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
can't do proper oversight
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
um in terms of burger king
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
setting up such a organization and
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
on sending the money only to its
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
own subsidiaries in some way so
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
but on that's true also of a lot of
 
00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:08.150 align:start position:0%
but on that's true also of a lot of
other

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
of these groups once once
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
now we have two forms of scene gaming
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
that are very close to slot machines
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
that are going to be all over the state
 
00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:20.710 align:start position:0%
that are going to be all over the state
and

00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
we're getting almost no money from them
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
unregulated except for the financial
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
flow and
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
that's that is my real
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
worry that we are not being serious
 
00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.589 align:start position:0%
worry that we are not being serious
about

00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
regulation of something the other states
 
00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:38.789 align:start position:0%
regulation of something the other states
regulate

00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh the comments that
 
00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:47.349 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh the comments that
uh

00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative ames made regarding uh
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
following the irc
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
and is is
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
is accurate regarding
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
the interface however that is something
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
that requires a committee to study
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
as representative only pointed out
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
this particular amendment this
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
are immaterial to that
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
as the gaming is going on right now
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
and for the most part it's going
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
for charitable items i can think of
 
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.030 align:start position:0%
for charitable items i can think of
several

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
several
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh hundreds of thousands of dollars that
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
are going to
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh disabled individuals that are going
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
nephrology clinic up in uh dartmouth by
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
the knights of columbus
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh the uh lions club doing uh
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
blind assistance uh the masons doing uh
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
their thing each one of the various
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
fraternities has the things into
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh in danger or to restrict
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
their ability to continue to raise funds
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
for these charitable items
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
at this point in time would seem to be
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
disadvantageous to the population of new
 
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.150 align:start position:0%
disadvantageous to the population of new
hampshire

00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
at the same time what representative
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
omni speaks of
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
our review and a discussion and
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
development is something that the
 
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:16.870 align:start position:0%
development is something that the
commission

00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully will be set up to do and i
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
would urge this committee
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
to set up an ad hoc committee if the
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
commission doesn't go forward
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh to discuss this uh further to make
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
sure that the
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
structure of the gaming is done by
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
a separate entity affiliated with in
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
some fashion
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
so that we do know where the money is
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
going and when they hold a uh
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
charitable poker night at the uh at the
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
river or
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
at seabrook uh you know where the money
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
is going
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
in the same way that you would if you
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
were doing a lottery or a
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
raffle excuse me uh those are all my
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
only comments i support the bill
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
as amended thank you representative

00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
yeah my wife came into the room to pick
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
something off the printer and i
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
well the printer started printing so i
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
had to mute myself so
 
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
uh remember our house bill
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
565 we passed unanimous to former
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
commission it was representative ames
 
00:58:23.119 --> 00:58:24.309 align:start position:0%
commission it was representative ames
bill

00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh that moved on it passed on consent
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
calendar went over to the senate of the

past
 
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
unanimous but they put it on the table
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
as i told you everyone last week i spoke
 
00:58:35.359 --> 00:58:36.150 align:start position:0%
as i told you everyone last week i spoke
to

00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
i reached out to senator d'alessandro
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
and we agreed
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh he even suggested that we broaden
 
00:58:42.559 --> 00:58:43.750 align:start position:0%
uh he even suggested that we broaden
ours

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
ours
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
our membership to four and uh we
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
discussed this last week
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
and we're we're doing it in a very
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%

uh basically what this does is has
language

01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%

01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
i can't think of the word here uh limit
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
it in a bi-annual manner of the uh
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh filing threshold starting with 92 000
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%

representative alani thank you mr
chairman

01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
on i'd just like to point the fiscal
 
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
note for
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
92 000 is 2.6 million dollars
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
a year on which is about a million more
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
than what the original bill was
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
but it does bring us up on i asked
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
dra to calculate on
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
where we would be with inflation from
 
01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.349 align:start position:0%
where we would be with inflation from
when

01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
the last threshold was set uh
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
and it is about a hundred dollars off i
 
01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:13.430 align:start position:0%
and it is about a hundred dollars off i
think

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
from 92 92
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh thousand
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh as a threshold so we are about as
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
close as
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
you can get and from there we'd keep up
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
with whatever inflation sends us
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
on so that we wouldn't have uh
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses being uh
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
uplifted into paying bpt
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
when in fact they aren't getting any
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
more real money
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
than they were getting before and we
 
01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:50.149 align:start position:0%
than they were getting before and we
also

01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
won't have a shock uh even of
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
2.5 million 2.6 million
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh this year i think our shock for bet
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
was greater at the time
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
to on to our revenues we will gradually
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
adapt to it
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
so um i hope that
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
everybody will vote for this thank you

with the ppp loans
 
01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.950 align:start position:0%
with the ppp loans
then

01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
add to what we
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
know about senate bill 3 at this point
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
in time
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
i'm having the dira come in tomorrow
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
the revenues that we have that's above
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
plan by an amount
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
and trying to segregate it into two
 
01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:10.950 align:start position:0%
and trying to segregate it into two
pieces

01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
one piece that has to do with
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3 passes how much of this
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
is associated with that 174 we already
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
have there
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
and how much will have to be refunded
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
and another peak we've asked them to
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
is that there's been a number of
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
stimulus packages since the pandemic
 
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.669 align:start position:0%
stimulus packages since the pandemic
started

01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
started
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
that have been applied to our state
 
01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.030 align:start position:0%
that have been applied to our state
which

01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
affects revenues it keeps people
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
employed uh and that
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
and therefore it generates a profit that
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
would not have happened
 
01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.639 align:start position:0%
and we need to understand about how much
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
excess that we have right now is
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
associated with that
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
because that's more of a one-time event
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
even though it may be spread out over a
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
few years
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
once the pandemic is over and we're back
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
to normal
 
01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
that is not going to be with us
 
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
and so they need to understand
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
that there's a certain amount of that
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
excess that we have
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
is associated with one-time money
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
and a certain amount that's associated
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
with money that would
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
we will have to refund the senate bill
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
3 passes as is so
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
um we need we will be provided more
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
information tomorrow
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative romney followed by
 
01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:02.790 align:start position:0%
representative romney followed by
representative

01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
and representative tucker so
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
i got a couple of emails yesterday i
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
guess we all did that
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
it sounds like chairman yellen
 
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh the treasury has come out with some
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
guidance um
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
and i haven't had a chance to read it
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
yet um but
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a factor in this whole
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
discussion that
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
yes whether or not uh they will uh
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
if we pass recipe if we pass sb3
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
whether the uh forgiveness of the
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
which would now then be non-taxable if
 
01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
we pass sp3
 
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
if we can use some of the whatever that
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
i lose track of the names of these
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
the 1.9 trillion dollar bill rescue
 
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
plan thank you uh whether we can use
 
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
that to offset
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
this uh loss in uh revenue
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
so that that's a factor that we i think
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
that was the last piece that we're
 
01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:03.990 align:start position:0%
that was the last piece that we're
waiting

01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
waiting
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
to hear about so but i don't know any
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%

and then tucker thank you mr chairman
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
on i did manage to listen into that
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
last night i had to beg off of something
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
i promised to do
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
and neither the presentation
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
nor the document that they sent out with
 
01:28:35.679 --> 01:28:36.229 align:start position:0%
nor the document that they sent out with
it

01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
had enough specifics to answer any of
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
the questions that we have
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
they did not mention the ppp loans in
 
01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:45.430 align:start position:0%
they did not mention the ppp loans in
the

01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
the document or the presentation on
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that um well and
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
and there are there's some stuff
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
that i consider rather worrisome about
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
your tax cuts
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
on that on the the way
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
they seem to be defining economic growth
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
so it's defined
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
in another section then the one
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
specifically about
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
tax cuts on is
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
that on that
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
it would you would have to have had a
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
a revenue loss of a certain amount
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
i think through this year i can't quite
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
remember i read it yet
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
last night for the first time um but
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
um i i do have a link
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
and uh everybody should have the link
 
01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:41.910 align:start position:0%
and uh everybody should have the link
soon

01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
soon
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
of on the to ask
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
specific questions of the man that has
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
been put in charge of the recovery unit
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
in the treasury
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
on i don't know how long it's going to
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
take him to ask questions that come
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
from a specific uh
 
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
state about our specific issues
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
but i uh wanted to
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh mention that here today before trying
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
to use the link to say
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
did you forget to talk about ppp and
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
is that thing we got last week
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
still still valid which would mean that
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
we could recover
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
that particular money from them but i am
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
not sure whether we could recover all of
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
it because
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
our loss will will come
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
over four years i think you said earlier
 
01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:36.629 align:start position:0%
over four years i think you said earlier
today

01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
and dra will be talking to us about
 
01:30:39.199 --> 01:30:40.390 align:start position:0%
and dra will be talking to us about
tomorrow

01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
and um they may only
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
allow recovery for for three years or
 
01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.950 align:start position:0%
allow recovery for for three years or
two

01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
so on we need to get that kind of thing
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
specified i don't think
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
anybody except treasury is going to be
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
able to specify it for us
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
but we do have a way that we can ask
 
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.350 align:start position:0%
but we do have a way that we can ask
them

01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:31:05.110 --> 01:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
this is why the dra will be here
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
tomorrow to help
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
clarify some of these questions that we
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
will need to
 
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
ask treasury or somebody representing
 
01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.910 align:start position:0%
ask treasury or somebody representing
treasury

01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
but dra needs to get their act together
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
in which they have
 
01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
which they're working on
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
because i was surprised
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
they could tell me that
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
the ppp loans so there's a certain
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
percentage that
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
will be affected this year
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
next year and and the bulk will be the
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
next two years
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
um representative tucker followed by
 
01:31:50.719 --> 01:31:52.390 align:start position:0%
um representative tucker followed by
representatives

01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i i would like to tomorrow
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
have someone go over what the people who
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
got these loans what
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
what did they think were the controlling
 
01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:06.229 align:start position:0%
what did they think were the controlling
factors

01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
factors
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
on whether they'd ever have to pay taxes
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
i'd sort of like to focus on that at the
 
01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:13.110 align:start position:0%
i'd sort of like to focus on that at the
outset

01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
outset
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
because that's what people are talking
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's clear that ways and means has to
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
think about a bigger picture
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
but i am very interested in what
 
01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:25.990 align:start position:0%
but i am very interested in what
individuals

01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire thought when
 
01:32:28.719 --> 01:32:29.430 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire thought when
they

01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
cashed their checks what did they
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
think were the rules
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
and why did they think that i'd like to
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
go over that
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
because we've done a lot of talking and
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
i still would like to know the answer to
 
01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:46.550 align:start position:0%
i still would like to know the answer to
that

01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:56.830 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um
 
01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:58.149 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um
[Music]

01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i i have uh looked at the document
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
sent out by the treasury i've read some
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
the key document that has the detail in
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
what they call their interim final rule
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
it's basically a published
 
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
ruling on uh implementation
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
of this act the american rescue plan
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
act and it has detailed provisions in it
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
that relate to what
 
01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:30.030 align:start position:0%
in shorthand are called tax cuts
 
01:33:30.030 --> 01:33:31.350 align:start position:0%
in shorthand are called tax cuts
[Music]

01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
and you can find it easily just by
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
searching for our um
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
rp um interim final rule
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
and you'll get it it's uh i i warn you
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
it's 160 page document
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
um so a couple of things
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
that are relevant to sp3 and then
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
more broadly the sp3 relevance is
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
what's had been mentioned the conformity
 
01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.390 align:start position:0%
what's had been mentioned the conformity
issue

01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
um if if new hampshire conforms
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
um in effect it's a tax cut
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
conforms to the rp rule that doesn't
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
that excuses from taxation the ppp
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's decision to conform
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
quite clearly they said this before
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
in a statement earlier
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
but the is in this interim final rule
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
quite clearly would not
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
be counted against new hampshire as a
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
tax cut
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's my reading i assume it will be
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
dra's reading
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
i think it's clear and
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere around page 86 i
 
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
seem to have misplaced my my print out
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
but about page 86 of that interim final
 
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.510 align:start position:0%
but about page 86 of that interim final
rule

01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
um then going beyond that
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
i think what's really important to for
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
ways and means to get an understanding
 
01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:16.310 align:start position:0%
ways and means to get an understanding
of

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
is the ongoing process that
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
treasury will use to assess
 
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
whether new hampshire
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
in adopting one or another
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
trespasses on the standard that
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
treasury will apply in determining
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
whether there will be some clawback if
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
you will
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
of um of rp revenues
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
that and there's a lot of language in
 
01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:53.350 align:start position:0%
that and there's a lot of language in
there

01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
about how
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
how the federal government will
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
do that assessment um and
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of it involves the kind of work
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
that ways and means is very much into
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
which is estimating revenues associated
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
with this that or the other
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
tax decision
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
so we've got to figure out our a number
 
01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
of things but one
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
one is exactly what's expected of the
 
01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.350 align:start position:0%
one is exactly what's expected of the
state

01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
and the second one is what role
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature and ways and means
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
should play with respect
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
to these judgments and my understanding
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
again this was a quick reading of it is
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
that it's a year
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
to year process
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
so um there
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's a repetitive reiterative kind of
 
01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:52.870 align:start position:0%
it's a repetitive reiterative kind of
thing

01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
looking at performance they try to
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
try to allow for a full discount of
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
revenue gains or losses that are related
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
to economic conditions that
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
have nothing to do with or maybe
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
indirectly very indirectly
 
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
relate to the stimulus of the federal
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
money but that are not directly related
 
01:37:16.719 --> 01:37:17.830 align:start position:0%
money but that are not directly related
to

01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
to the provisions of rb and its grant
 
01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:22.229 align:start position:0%
to the provisions of rb and its grant
money

01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
so we've got to be sure that we
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
understand what's expected of us
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
and that we're doing what we should be
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
doing as a legislative body
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
i think that's pretty important and then
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
just a note there are what you might
 
01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:40.390 align:start position:0%
just a note there are what you might
call

01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
call
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
safe harbors there there are rules of
 
01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:43.669 align:start position:0%
safe harbors there there are rules of
thumb

01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
thumb
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
that the federal government will apply
 
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
a standard inflation factor that would
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
be presumptive for
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
each state that if revenue came in above
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
revenue from the sort of general fund
 
01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.149 align:start position:0%
revenue from the sort of general fund
education

01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
trust fund kinds of uh money that we
 
01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:06.310 align:start position:0%
trust fund kinds of uh money that we
have

01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
um came in above
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh or below estimated money there would
 
01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
be this sort of test that would be
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
applied and
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you were in the right place relative
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
test there would be no further inquiry
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a safe harbor
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
um and it's really complicated so i'm
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
not sure i'm fully
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
i'm explaining it exactly right but
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
anyway there's a lot of work to be done
 
01:38:30.719 --> 01:38:31.189 align:start position:0%
anyway there's a lot of work to be done
here

01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
and hopefully dra will help us
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
work through that uh including telling
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
us who
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
and on the executive side will be
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
working on these issues so
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you before i go to
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
represent elmi
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
in addition the american recovery act
 
01:38:57.109 --> 01:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
affects funds that are going to go
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
directly to the
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
local community your local
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
county and the state
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
so we need to understand as legislators
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
especially with our county
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
because we all set the county budget
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
what we can
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
and what we can't do with these funds as
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
well as what we can and can
 
01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
do for the state and we need to help
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
the our community that we live in
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
understand what they can and can't do
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
so we've got a lot of work ahead of us
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
because of this
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative elmi thank you
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
i got a couple of things now on
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
taking the last first on
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
what they sent us that i can send
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
send everybody on was
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
a synthesis document of what
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative ames was just talking
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
about plus a lot more including and they
 
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
were more interested
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
in talking to municipal and county
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
heads than they were in talking to a
 
01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:10.239 align:start position:0%
state in that
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
this in that meeting that i listened to
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
last night
 
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
on so that you could start from that
 
01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:17.990 align:start position:0%
on so that you could start from that
synthesis

01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
synthesis
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
and then go to the 165 page document to
 
01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
search for county
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
for instance and find a lot of the
 
01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:27.750 align:start position:0%
for instance and find a lot of the
material

01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
material
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
what i'm really most worried about on
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
on the tax cut side is
 
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
what um is the timing of
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
when what period they
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
they mean and maybe they were more
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
specific in the 165 pager
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
on what time period they meant when they
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
said growth from what
 
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
time because we got a lot of money in
 
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
just now
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
the year 19 is the standard it's the
 
01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
year 19 but
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
who's fiscal year
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's what on on
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
and they they yeah they did say fiscal
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
year once but
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
they didn't say whether it was state or
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
or federal
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
um and there's a big difference there
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
so um that needs to be cleared up
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
and how long they would
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
allow us to be whether
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
if we recalculate year to year then
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
since we lost money in 20 if we weren't
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
able to re
 
01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
re recover in
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
21 could we recover that
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
in 22 um
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
these are all things these are all
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
things we we need to
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
to get straight and once we understand
 
01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
what the rules are
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
right well on yeah and that's where i
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
hope dra can
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
can help us with that if not we're going
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
to you're going to have to be
 
01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
asking a set of specific questions to
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
the treasury
 
01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
there's an only dra we need to get some
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
expertise here that can
 
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
any questions that we have of the
 
01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:20.709 align:start position:0%
any questions that we have of the
treasury

01:42:20.709 --> 01:42:20.719 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah but i don't think we're going to
 
01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
get a person from the treasury
 
01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
to our committee so
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i think we have specific questions
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
based on new hampshire's
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
tax system so i think we may have to
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
depend on you sending a list of formal
 
01:42:40.709 --> 01:42:40.719 align:start position:0%
questions and seeing
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
how soon we can get the answers back but
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
um the or dra sending it
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
on the other thing was that we could
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
try to invite a chamber head
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
or two to to talk to us about
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
ed's question represent tucker's
 
01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:04.070 align:start position:0%
ed's question represent tucker's
question

01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
about uh what the applicants for ppp
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
thought they were getting into when they
 
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
when they got
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
the loans that they were planning on
 
01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
getting forgiven
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
and on that
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
on we've got some chamber links that we
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
could call on
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
i know the the one in the upper valley
 
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
very strong in in helping
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
businesses in our region to to apply for
 
01:43:35.119 --> 01:43:35.750 align:start position:0%
businesses in our region to to apply for
these

01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
and work their way through them and i
 
01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:38.870 align:start position:0%
and work their way through them and i
presume

01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
presume
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's true also in nashua and
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
probably in a number of they have all
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
been talking to each other so probably
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
any of the chamber heads could could
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
talk to us about
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
what that was right we need to
 
01:43:58.390 --> 01:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
understand those things but number one
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
the most important is the rules
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
and how how we can utilize these without
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
having to pay money back so we
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
channel it in the right once we
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
then we can address what people think
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
and other things and what and what we
 
01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:22.149 align:start position:0%
and other things and what and what we
can

01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
mr chairman a deserved time frame for
 
01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:29.990 align:start position:0%
mr chairman a deserved time frame for
this

01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
the 27th or because
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
i think it is unfortunately
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh we need to address senate bill 3
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'm already sent
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
around the 20s so that's one issue
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
the other issue is to understand
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
the rules on the american recovery funds
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
and once we understand that we'll
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
probably understand the rules on the
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
and so the sooner we can do that and
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can understand it before we
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
pass a budget
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
because if we pass
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
and as you say if we pass a budget
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
that cuts some taxes
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
we may be foolish
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
because we may lose more money
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
we may want to delay some of those
 
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.109 align:start position:0%
we may want to delay some of those
things

01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
so that we don't it doesn't
 
01:45:43.590 --> 01:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
interfere with the rules for utilizing
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
the american recovery funds and the
 
01:45:47.590 --> 01:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
others so we have to understand those
 
01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.470 align:start position:0%
others so we have to understand those
things

01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
we don't know that yet we need guys like
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
represent ames and and the smart people
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
that we have on
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
our committee plus more to ask
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
all right anything else uh
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative software
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you just briefly for dover
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
um it's been fairly consistent that
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
people have said
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
they were hoping the loans would be
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
forgiven um
 
01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand especially the
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
larger businesses
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
paid the estimated tax as if they were
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
so they kind of you know have looked at
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
both sides and i have a feeling that's
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
yeah and so they contributed to
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
this bump that we had in
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
business taxes that we see now
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
that uh if this passes as
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
is we're going to have to refund
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative or you have another
 
01:47:08.239 --> 01:47:15.830 align:start position:0%
representative or you have another
comment

01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
i just got completely muted uh i didn't
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
really mean to hit it anyway but
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
i think that uh we've got a pretty clear
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
idea from
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
the local cpas that
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
on the local businesses
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much all if they had enough
 
01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:40.950 align:start position:0%
pretty much all if they had enough
profit

01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
profit
 
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
to worry about it took that option
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
that on representative southworth is
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
my problem is how many of the
 
01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:52.629 align:start position:0%
my problem is how many of the
subsidiaries

01:47:52.629 --> 01:47:52.639 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries
 
01:47:56.709 --> 01:47:56.719 align:start position:0%
of the megacorporations that pay most of
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
our tax
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
on took that and were incorporated
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
into the water's edge filing
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
and how much wood might we lose from
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
that and did dr was dra thinking of that
 
01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:12.709 align:start position:0%
that and did dr was dra thinking of that
problem

01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
tomorrow you'll have an opportunity to
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
