00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
okay for everybody that's here in the
 
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
room right now we're going to be
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
starting a few minutes later we have a
 
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
new side by side on HP uh SB 266 it's a
 
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
new one that's just been presented to us
 
00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 align:start position:0%
uh representative cordelli's gone
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
upstairs tried to get a few more copies
 
00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 align:start position:0%
made for the folks that are in the crowd
 
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
here so out in front not the crowd
 
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
but uh so we're gonna just hold off so
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
that when we start everybody can be
 
00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 align:start position:0%
looking at the same document that we're
 
00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
so just hang loose for about five
 
00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
see Jennifer's not here she's in traffic
 
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
and so one of the other gals upstairs
 
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
gave this to me and she didn't know
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:19.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to go ahead with the
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
the discussion we have today the work
 
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
session on SB 266 this enact relative to
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
Statewide educational Improvement and
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
assessment programs
 
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
and does everybody out front have a copy
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
of the 4 3 23
 
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
edition of this side by side
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
I went through the that looking at the
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
at least the placement of words on each
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
of these Pages it looks almost the same
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
as what we've had before so
 
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.690 align:start position:0%
as what we've had before so
um

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
we have uh from the Department here we
 
00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:01.790 align:start position:0%
we have uh from the Department here we
have

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
um Nate green and Caitlin Davis
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh what Nate and Kate and why don't you
 
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:10.019 align:start position:0%
come on up to the table so as we cruise
 
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
through this we have done some work on
 
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.610 align:start position:0%
through this we have done some work on
this

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
um Caitlin were you here for that work
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
yeah we did yeah
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
okay so perhaps what be wise for us to
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
do here so as we go through we've
 
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
identified to where we dropped off some
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
issues or not issues but where it didn't
 
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
match up with current law and so what we
 
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
can do is probably ask some of those
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
questions of Caitlyn and of Nate right
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
now so maybe we can get some answer to
 
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.030 align:start position:0%
now so maybe we can get some answer to
that

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:52.519 align:start position:0%
so I can start out
 
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
there was question on the on the left
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
hand side there at top what we're
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
talking about academic standards
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
and above that let's see
 
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.329 align:start position:0%
and above that let's see
um

00:13:11.329 --> 00:13:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
okay yeah the academic standards the
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
academic standards this is written in
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
law means what a student should know and
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
be able to do in a course or at each
 
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:22.740 align:start position:0%
grade level when we looked at on the
 
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
other side for academic standards we're
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
also seeing that it's now Statewide
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
academic standards or academic standards
 
00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:37.019 align:start position:0%
and any mention of of a course is gone
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
or four
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
perfect yeah
 
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:45.949 align:start position:0%
perfect yeah
um

00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
so academic standards as a whole is a
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
much broader term that encompasses
 
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
everything that a student might do at a
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
grade level some of the standards in
 
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
particular subject areas cover larger
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
standards that may not be specific to a
 
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
particular course so if we're
 
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
referencing courses specifically they're
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
going to be Niche level courses at the
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
high school level that may not
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily have course standards but
 
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
they would have larger sets of Standards
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
attached to them a good example of this
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
might be if you're a senior and you're
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
taking an English elective in a
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
Shakespeare literature there may not be
 
00:14:23.889 --> 00:14:23.899 align:start position:0%
specific core standards relatively grade
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
so having the requirement that all
 
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
courses have those standards they're not
 
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
necessarily course level standards most
 
00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
of the time we have grade level
 
00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:32.579 align:start position:0%
standards and then often our larger
 
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
courses have core standards that come
 
00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
from the grade level standards so on
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that and I'll let others
 
00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:39.779 align:start position:0%
join in
 
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
we have social studies and we know those
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
standards are adopted in the latter part
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
of 2008 something like that and those
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
are applicable not just to Elementary or
 
00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
middle but they're also applicable
 
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
and if we're talking U.S history there
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
are academic standards for U.S history
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's a course that's required for
 
00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
graduation at the high school
 
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's not a grade level somebody might
 
00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
take that at grade 10 some might take it
 
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
at Grade 9 11
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
Etc so so that's the reason why we had
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
in statute the word course there because
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
it's grade levels up to a certain point
 
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
but then it becomes coarse
 
00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:20.339 align:start position:0%
and that makes sense I don't think that
 
00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
there's a large issue with having the
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
word course within the definition I
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
don't think it presents a problem to the
 
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
field to have it within that definition
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
so I think if that's something that the
 
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to add back in I don't
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
see anything we're not wanting to add it
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
back in it's inside right so I'm sorry
 
00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
okay uh are there other questions that
 
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
what is the difference then between
 
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
Statewide academic standards and
 
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
academic standards
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
so Statewide academic standards would
 
00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:52.139 align:start position:0%
refer specifically to any standards that
 
00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
have been adopted by the state board of
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
education but we know there are a lot of
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
other standards out there Beyond just
 
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
what have been adopted by the state
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
board so academic standards refer to any
 
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
set of academic standards that a school
 
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
and District might use Statewide
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
academic standards are specifically
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question yeah
 
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
so does this mean then uh based upon
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
what you just said that the uh that the
 
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh state board will uh adopt Statewide
 
00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:26.519 align:start position:0%
Savage so the state board has adopted
 
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
Statewide standards in the core content
 
00:16:31.129 --> 00:16:31.139 align:start position:0%
areas for the state so we have statewide
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
standards in English mathematics and
 
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
science we have a social studies
 
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
framework that I believe the State Board
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
had adopted a number of years ago I know
 
00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:41.579 align:start position:0%
that there's been talk about updating
 
00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:44.339 align:start position:0%
those but beyond those four core content
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
areas I don't believe the state board
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
has adopted any additional standards so
 
00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
for example in art or music there aren't
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
Statewide standards that have been
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
formally adopted by the State Board of
 
00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:55.850 align:start position:0%
formally adopted by the State Board of
Education

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:16:59.810 --> 00:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
and so uh what is to what extent then
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
will school districts Charter Schools
 
00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:06.299 align:start position:0%
Etc be except be expected to adhere to
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
those standards so right now most
 
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
schools and districts in the state use
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
those Statewide standards but there
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
isn't a requirement in statute that all
 
00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
schools must use those standards the
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
reason most schools use them anyway is
 
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
because we use those standards to create
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
the state test and all of the students
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
whether you're in a public school or
 
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School are required to
 
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:30.059 align:start position:0%
take the state test and so if a school
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
is using a different set of Standards
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
than what we've built our state test on
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
they may see differences in the academic
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
performance of their students so so then
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
the local school district or Charter
 
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
School it's up to them whether or not
 
00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:45.539 align:start position:0%
they want to adhere to those standards
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
at their Peril if you may correct from a
 
00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:49.820 align:start position:0%
standpoint of
 
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
aligning with the
 
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
Statewide exams in yes yeah and in fact
 
00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
the there is a statute because the state
 
00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
board when they adopted the New
 
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire framework for mathematics and
 
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
for ELA those were the Common Core State
 
00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
Standards we have another statute that
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
says explicitly no District shall be
 
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
forced to adopt the common core
 
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.850 align:start position:0%
forced to adopt the common core
standards

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
this may be the English probably coming
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
out when you hear my question but I'm
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
concerned about what is the intended
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%
meaning when you say means what a
 
00:18:33.169 --> 00:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
student should know and be able to do in
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
a course and at each grade level now as
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
a former English teacher I'd like to
 
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
delude myself perhaps by thinking they
 
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
knew less when they entered the course
 
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
and emerged with more so I just want to
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
clarify that's what the current law says
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
that is the language that the current
 
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
law uses so if we have issues with that
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
we could talk about that but we were
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
trying to not stray too much from that
 
00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
how do you determine what they need in
 
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
order to take the course from what they
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
need to graduate from the course
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
so the standards are the expectations of
 
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
the knowledge the students will have at
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
the end of the course okay and primarily
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
we use this to set our benchmarks on the
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
state test so when you have fourth
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
graders take the fourth grade State
 
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
assessment that's based off of those
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
fourth grade standards and see
 
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
expectation that by the time you get to
 
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
the end of fourth grade you'll have met
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
those fourth grade standards so if we
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
revise this to read upon completion of
 
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
it would be a little more explicit
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
it would yeah one of the things that um
 
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
we've had conversations with schools and
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
districts about is the particular
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
testing window because the standards are
 
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
based upon what the students will know
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
by the time they get to the end of that
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
grade level depending on when students
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
take the test if it's towards the end of
 
00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
the school year or if it's a little bit
 
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
more earlier in the spring they may not
 
00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:54.539 align:start position:0%
have gotten through all the different
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
standards so there is some scheduling
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
considerations when schools are looking
 
00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:00.299 align:start position:0%
at their curriculum and what they're
 
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
teaching and when they're giving the
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
state test to make sure that students
 
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
have mastered those standards for the
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
grade level am I correct in assuming
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
that that could skew your data
 
00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:12.049 align:start position:0%
that that could skew your data
um

00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:12.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
yes theoretically it could we haven't
 
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
done any kind of research into different
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
schools and when they're testing and
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
whether they're we see differences at
 
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
that level between schools but
 
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
theoretically it could if you had one
 
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
school that tested much much earlier in
 
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.299 align:start position:0%
the spring and one school that tested
 
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
you know far later and the end of the
 
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
school year
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
further questions on this represent
 
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
Tanner and then representative cascaden
 
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um how is you talked
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
about common core but how is Esa sa
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
affected by this
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
so one of the things we've done with
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
this particular draft in their Visions
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
is to bring it in line with the current
 
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
Essa regulations
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
um and so regulations require states to
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
have standards that's one of the reasons
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
why the state board has adopted the
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
standards that we have because in order
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
to have uh State assessment system that
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
will meet the Essa regulations it has to
 
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
be built on those nationally recognized
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
standards not necessarily Common Core
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
but the state has to adopt something to
 
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299 align:start position:0%
use as a framework for their state
 
00:21:15.299 --> 00:21:17.029 align:start position:0%
use as a framework for their state
testing

00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:18.850 align:start position:0%
testing
yes

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:18.860 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
so Essa I believe also had social
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
studies and some other subjects that
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
that were under Essa
 
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.270 align:start position:0%
that were under Essa
um

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
is that not taken into consideration now
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
or so there isn't a requirement that the
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
state test in social studies so right
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
now we're meeting the the requirements
 
00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:45.419 align:start position:0%
of the SSA states can then add on
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
additional requirements and most often
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
that social studies one is the next one
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
that adds on and there are many states
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
that do have State Testing programs and
 
00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:54.419 align:start position:0%
social studies but that's not something
 
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has had as part of
 
00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
our Statewide testing program
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden
 
00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:06.649 --> 00:22:06.659 align:start position:0%
um I'm just questioning
 
00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:07.310 align:start position:0%
um I'm just questioning
um

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
academic standards that that particular
 
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
line and I know you didn't want to go
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
there but
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
does it relate to the 193e colon 3 the
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
delivery of an adequate education I mean
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
can we say that
 
00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:24.539 align:start position:0%
the Statewide standards or academic
 
00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:27.059 align:start position:0%
standards of schools use
 
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
to show what students know and be able
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
to do at grade levels is the delivery of
 
00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
an adequate education
 
00:22:38.289 --> 00:22:38.299 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily no because
 
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
the delivery of inadequate education has
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
the two different parts so 183 e3b is
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
the accountability section and that
 
00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
talks about the performance-based
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
accountability system and that's based
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
upon a number of factors some of that is
 
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
achievement and growth which is based on
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
the State Testing system so in that
 
00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
sense it does pull in those academic
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
standards because that's what we use to
 
00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
build the state assessment and then
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
measure students achievement and growth
 
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
but there are a number of other factors
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
that are taken in as well as part of 193
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
e3b additional data that goes beyond the
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
State Testing system
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
to me Nate it seems like the tail is
 
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
wagging the dog here in this we're we're
 
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
basing our academic standards on a
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment test
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
not on our curriculum that we have those
 
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
other components of a substantive
 
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
education which they're what nine or so
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
subject areas there but we're only going
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
to be measure our accounting or for
 
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
improvement and assessment on English
 
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:48.059 align:start position:0%
language arts math science
 
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
um reading that's it and what about
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
areas that are not uh tested like health
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
for physical education or music or
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
personal finance literacy how do we
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
measure those academic standards and why
 
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
why then are we not saying those are
 
00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
academic standards
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
you know I'm just getting really you
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
know I think we're trying to align what
 
00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:18.419 align:start position:0%
we do as standards with our assessment
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
rather than the assessment lining with
 
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
our curriculum and our instruction so
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
right now the assessment aligns with the
 
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
standards that we have for science math
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
and English and teachers build their
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum off of that so I would I
 
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
would say in essence that those three
 
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:36.539 align:start position:0%
subject areas there is a pretty large
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
alignment we have the standards I'm not
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
questioning that alignment so I would
 
00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:42.299 align:start position:0%
say the the biggest issue with not
 
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
testing and all those other subject
 
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
areas would be cost and budget so we we
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
do assess in those three core content
 
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
areas and our Assessment program you
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
know is is four to five million dollars
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
a year to be able to assess in those
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
three subject areas to have a valid
 
00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
Statewide test that all students take
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
requires a pretty large resource with
 
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
personnel and time and and finances so
 
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
it certainly is you know something the
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
legislature could look into if it's
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
something the state wanted to go in that
 
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
direction but we would need
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
significantly more resources to be able
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
to test outside of those three core
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to say we have to do a
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment for those core
 
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
areas I'm trying to
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
say that the academic standards for the
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
non-tested areas are just as important
 
00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
as the ones where
 
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
we're we're testing for
 
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.350 align:start position:0%
we're we're testing for
so

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll leave it at that and our
 
00:25:45.289 --> 00:25:45.299 align:start position:0%
measurement of that right now is through
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
the ibass system that that's how we
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
okay is there any further disc yes
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
represent Cascade
 
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
just based on your what you were saying
 
00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
it made me think that all districts at
 
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
one point I believe when Essa
 
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
um came on a table had to develop
 
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
competencies for everything that was
 
00:26:09.409 --> 00:26:09.419 align:start position:0%
taught and I had to develop a system
 
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
either through ibas or pbas to measure
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
how the students met that competency
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if there's a need for a
 
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
national or Statewide testing
 
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:27.059 align:start position:0%
I mean is that I mean that's what I'm
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
thinking just well I can remember when
 
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
we went into the business of
 
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
competencies and I can remember Fred
 
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
bermonte being here and working with us
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
on that and the concern we had back then
 
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
and while some are just going to take
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
their goals and objectives and those are
 
00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:45.419 align:start position:0%
now our standards uh and uh some school
 
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
districts probably did do that initially
 
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
but those competencies are based upon
 
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you so schools and districts
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
um write competencies at the local level
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
we do have some State model competencies
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
in some areas that districts can use but
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
but they are a model they're not a full
 
00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
set of competencies and competencies
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
really are part of the local curriculum
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
so one of the issues you run into in
 
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
trying to look at it from a state level
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
and do comparisons across schools and
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
districts is that everybody has written
 
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
their own set of competencies for the
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
most part and that makes it a little bit
 
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
harder to then do comparisons not only
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
from one school to another school next
 
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
to it but across all schools throughout
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
the state because we don't have a set of
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
standard competencies in every
 
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
curricular area it really is a part of
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
the local school curriculum so schools
 
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
and districts if particularly if you
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
have a large District so for example if
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
you're Manchester or Nashua you would
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
have a core set of competencies for your
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
District that all of your schools are
 
00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
using so they have a good way of
 
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
measuring whether students are
 
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
proficient at their local level but it
 
00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:57.539 align:start position:0%
does make it challenging at a state
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
level to compare schools to each other
 
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
because again not everybody's using the
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:08.220 align:start position:0%
yes I I get that part representative
 
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you
 
00:28:12.409 --> 00:28:12.419 align:start position:0%
um yes I mean I definitely agree with
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
you Nate um you know and I know there
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
are teams and regions that have worked
 
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
together on competencies because it was
 
00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299 align:start position:0%
an overwhelming task to begin with
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
but would it not change a definition of
 
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
adequate education if there was more
 
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.890 align:start position:0%
adequate education if there was more
testing

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
or am I not asking the right question
 
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
are they the same as adequate education
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
and because there's a lot of discussion
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
of what's an adequate education and it's
 
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
very clearly defined but now where
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
Statewide testing is just in the three
 
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
Three core areas per se
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
and if we were testing more
 
00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:52.340 align:start position:0%
of the requirements in the Ed rules
 
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
would that then transition back into
 
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
adequacy which you know has a ripple
 
00:28:57.779 --> 00:28:58.789 align:start position:0%
adequacy which you know has a ripple
effect

00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
I mean do you see a correlation between
 
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
what's defined as an adequate education
 
00:29:06.649 --> 00:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
and what requirements and Statewide
 
00:29:06.659 --> 00:29:07.970 align:start position:0%
and what requirements and Statewide
testing

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
if there is a connection
 
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:13.860 align:start position:0%
so that's a hard question there's I
 
00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:15.419 align:start position:0%
would say there there's a connection to
 
00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:18.059 align:start position:0%
link it yeah there is a connection in
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
that the way we've determined a part of
 
00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
our accountability system does rest on
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
the assessment system the accountability
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
system is also much broader than that
 
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
and looks at many other factors things
 
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
like graduation rate attendance data
 
00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
School environment data so we take a lot
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
of that into account with the
 
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
accountability system
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
you could reinvent or reimagine I think
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
the way you look at inadequate education
 
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
by saying we're going to look at it
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
purely through an academic lens and test
 
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
in each of those required areas but
 
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
historically that's not something that's
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
ever been part of our current statutory
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
system the testing is just one component
 
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:00.620 align:start position:0%
in the the pbas system in 193 3B
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
could you have a follow-up yeah just uh
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up and you can have them
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
um so is the accountability system
 
00:30:14.169 --> 00:30:14.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
and so there's a couple of components to
 
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
it so ibas for example looks at all of
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
the requirements in an adequate
 
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
education so schools have to verify that
 
00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:24.539 align:start position:0%
they're in compliance with all you know
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
12 or 13 of those areas and 193 e2a and
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's on the front end that you know
 
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
you have a arch program you have a
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
mathematics program you have a world
 
00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
languages program you have a school year
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's 180 days or 990 hours so that's
 
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
also part of the accountability and that
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
looks at each of those areas in e2a the
 
00:30:45.289 --> 00:30:45.299 align:start position:0%
assessment part is on the back end in
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
terms of the output so how are students
 
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
doing in particular areas things like
 
00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
their math achievement or English
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
achievement How are schools doing with
 
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
their graduation rate and that's where
 
00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:57.299 align:start position:0%
we the assessment component fits into
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
that part of it but I think you have to
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
look at the totality of both ibas and
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
pbas together to verify whether students
 
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419 align:start position:0%
are providing or whether schools are
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
providing the opportunity for an
 
00:31:09.289 --> 00:31:09.299 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for uh
 
00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
both for being here if I can get away
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
with it I might have a couple questions
 
00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.169 align:start position:0%
with it I might have a couple questions
here

00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
um so in the first couple pages I see as
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
far as developing the test it refers to
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
people involved including stakeholders
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
and among others it specifically
 
00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:30.299 align:start position:0%
mentions Community Representatives I was
 
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
hoping that you might be able to provide
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
us with a fairly comprehensive view of
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
who would be represented by stakeholders
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
and exactly what is meant by Community
 
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.470 align:start position:0%
and exactly what is meant by Community
Representatives

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
so I probably wouldn't be able to give
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
you a specific example of you know who
 
00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:48.539 align:start position:0%
would be represented as a community
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
stakeholder at what point they've been
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
involved in that process when we go
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
through the development of the State
 
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:54.950 align:start position:0%
through the development of the State
Testing

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
Testing
 
00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
um much of what we do
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
that pull stakeholders in directly is
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
the standard setting oftentimes that
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
involves local school leaders and
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
teachers in each of the grade levels and
 
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
the content areas so when we set the cut
 
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
scores for our state testing those have
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
all been done by groups of New Hampshire
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
Educators that have come in they've gone
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
through the test questions they've taken
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
the tests themselves and identified
 
00:32:21.649 --> 00:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
based off of their classroom knowledge
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
and instruction and curriculum if a
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
student were to take the test and answer
 
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
questions at a particular level this is
 
00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:30.299 align:start position:0%
where those levels will be on the state
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
test so as we're measuring whether
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
students are proficient or not
 
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
proficient much of that has been done
 
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
through those committees we also have
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
committees that come in and look at
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
things like bias insensitivity reviews
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
we go through particular items to make
 
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
sure that the items themselves make
 
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
sense and often that's done through
 
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
Committees of stakeholders that we bring
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
into the department
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and if I may
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
um as far as the particular items that
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
are to be tested as far as various
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
competent competencies go I see a number
 
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
of references to things uh such as
 
00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
social competencies or preparing uh
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
students for social engagement so is
 
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
there supposed to be measurement or
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
testing for any sort of non-academic
 
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
competencies such as social or emotional
 
00:33:18.769 --> 00:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
competencies in this there's not now
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
actually if you could point me to a
 
00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
reference because the tests themselves
 
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
each item on the test is directly
 
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
connected to a particular academic
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
standard whether it be math or Ela so we
 
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
don't have any social emotional
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
standards that the test itself is based
 
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:34.140 align:start position:0%
on sure yeah I was just looking at
 
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
things like page five line 29 for
 
00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
instance successful participation in the
 
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
social economic scientific technological
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
and political systems of a free
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
government and other references like
 
00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:46.019 align:start position:0%
that there wasn't anything specific to
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
that so I just wanted to rule it out
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so this that's part of sort of
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
the overarching I think purpose of why
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
should a test uh or why should a state
 
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
have an assessment system what do we
 
00:34:03.649 --> 00:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
hope to get out of education for our
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
students so it's not that our assessment
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
system necessarily measures everything
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
within that list I think that's sort of
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
an idealistic overarching statement of
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
why we do education yeah thank you and
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
if I'm if I may again on page four
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
um line 29 through 30.
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
um it says that the department May
 
00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:27.740 align:start position:0%
collect and uh shall provide
 
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh student address information to the
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
third party testing what is the need for
 
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
collecting their home address that was
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
that was added in about two years ago to
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that the student assessment
 
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
results were provided directly to
 
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
parents so there was some concern I
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
think um it was coming from this
 
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
committee you might remember
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
representative lakis that parents
 
00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:52.379 align:start position:0%
weren't able to access student
 
00:34:54.169 --> 00:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
assessment results so that's what that
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
legislation was added for
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
what I I think we ought to do is rather
 
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
than jumping around through here let's
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
continue going in in order through this
 
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
report we're on page three in my last
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
part in common here is I'm really
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
concerned that we're relegating all
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
those subject learning areas which are
 
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
not tested to the back seat of the car
 
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
in fact we had testimony the other day
 
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:23.339 align:start position:0%
when we had folks in here testing or
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
testifying on the Civics bill
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
and basically as social studies they're
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
saying well that you know it's not being
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
taught in some schools not because we're
 
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
not tested on that in these schools
 
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
um so it is a concern to me that the
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
academic standards should be based upon
 
00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
all those areas
 
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
that we have called adequacy and aligned
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
with those competencies at various
 
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
levels and at courses so that we
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you know one of the
 
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
persons that testified was a credible
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
person with the Education
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
Association and indicated that she's not
 
00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:08.099 align:start position:0%
too sure that the only thing that's
 
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
being taught in fact of New Hampshire
 
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
history might be the visit to the
 
00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not tested anywhere so
 
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
and we're we're putting a lot of heat on
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
teachers to make sure you do an adequate
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
job and the way it's discerned by the
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
public is that assessment test this the
 
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
federal test which we're required to
 
00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.190 align:start position:0%
federal test which we're required to
give

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
give
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
and so it seems to me the federal
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
government's wagging what we do here in
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I think there's
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
probably some room for improvement on
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
our Assessment program and all the
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
additional areas but that's a large
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
departure from where the current law
 
00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:44.339 align:start position:0%
lies and that's not what we're trying to
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
do with this bill
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and again Nate just talked about it
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
would take a large amount of resources
 
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
to do this additional work we're able to
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
leverage our federal dollars right now
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of the work that we're
 
00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
supposed to do for the state side of
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
things through the federal dollars
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
because it's a basically a two-for-one
 
00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:05.099 align:start position:0%
deal we've already required to do it
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
from the federal side of things so we
 
00:37:07.609 --> 00:37:07.619 align:start position:0%
just kind of get the benefit on the
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
state side of things if we're talking
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
about developing a state Assessment
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
program that has a large departure from
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
the federal program we should talk about
 
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
what that looks like potentially maybe
 
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
have a study committee over the summer
 
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
talk about you know have additional
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
resources from schools assessment
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
vendors and whatnot
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
um and that's certainly some place we
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
would certainly be able to provide
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
support to the committee on doing that
 
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
but that's not the what we are in 10
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned what this bill was yeah I I
 
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
get that and you know I can remember
 
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
when we used to have social studies as
 
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
an area which was part of the
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the state to test we
 
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
weren't doing it so that's why if
 
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
economics geography civics government
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
history were all put on to the local
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
level uh I I probably wasn't there that
 
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
time going ahead and doing that and I
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
can remember representative Heath saying
 
00:37:59.810 --> 00:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
be careful where you're going and that's
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
exactly where we are right now we're at
 
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
the point where
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
um it's it's you know we don't know
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
what's going on in terms curriculum in
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
that area curriculum we know
 
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
performance why on that one test how
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
they're doing in those areas which are
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
tested but
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of emphasis was being placed on
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
testing and that's kind of governing and
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
the dollars needed yes I understand that
 
00:38:23.569 --> 00:38:23.579 align:start position:0%
you get federal dollars you have we
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate dollars for the testing
 
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
but if that should not be I guess we're
 
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
building a budget or a budget that's
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
what we're building we're it's not
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
program budgeting it's Budget Building
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
you know where in other words the the
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
program is not you know dictating these
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
costs it's what we have we're building a
 
00:38:47.089 --> 00:38:47.099 align:start position:0%
program around the budget
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
kind of kind of reverse philosophy that
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
I was taught when I was in school
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
but I guess it's reality
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
further questions represent Tanner
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
so I guess
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
banking on what you've been saying a
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
little bit is that I'd like as we go
 
00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
through this and and particularly with
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
this one you said it wasn't the intent
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to know
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
um with these changes what's the intent
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
of it why are you doing it and also what
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
are the potential consequences on the
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
over because part of the problem with me
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
looking at these statutes is and you
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
know they're also intertwined
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
particularly around adequacy that that
 
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
if we change one part how does it change
 
00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
another part and what's the consequences
 
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
on a local school district so if you
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
could give some information background
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
information on that
 
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
um I too am very concerned about the
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
academic standards that that we get down
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
to the point where
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
um as we were the last term where uh
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
school ends up being science math and
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
English and that's that's it
 
00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:56.099 align:start position:0%
um and you know a comprehensive
 
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
education takes in much more than that
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
so uh if you could kind of talk about
 
00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:04.619 align:start position:0%
changing the academic standards as you
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
have here and I don't exactly know why
 
00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
they're in quotes
 
00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:09.470 align:start position:0%
they're in quotes
um

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
but what what's the intent of that and
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
what are the possible consequences as
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
far as an adequate education and
 
00:40:19.609 --> 00:40:19.619 align:start position:0%
comprehensive education so they're well
 
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
to start with simple simplest answer the
 
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
reason that's in quotes is because this
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
is the definition sections of the law
 
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
um and we use so that's why that's in
 
00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:27.890 align:start position:0%
um and we use so that's why that's in
quotes

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
quotes
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
um and so currently in current law we do
 
00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
already have a definition of academic
 
00:40:32.099 --> 00:40:33.230 align:start position:0%
already have a definition of academic
standards

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
um the reason we use Statewide academic
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
standards and added that word Statewide
 
00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:38.579 align:start position:0%
is because there's confusion right now
 
00:40:40.849 --> 00:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
of are we talking about local standards
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
are we talking about state standards are
 
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
we talking about the minimum standards
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
the word standards is used so many times
 
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
throughout the law to talk about
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
different sections that we've we kind of
 
00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
just thought additional narrative as an
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
additional descriptor there would help
 
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
clarify which standards we're talking
 
00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
about here even after there was a an
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
oversight Committee in this room a month
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
or two ago and Nate was here I know we
 
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
were talking about all the different
 
00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
standards and the differences of
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
standards and competencies and all of
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
those things and we were talking about
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
that we actually probably need to write
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
a paper on from the Department fine when
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about academic standards
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about curriculum when
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
we're talking about competencies and all
 
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
of those right now I think there's
 
00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:19.619 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're conflated and it's
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
confusion and and so what we've tried to
 
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
do and the majority of this is is just
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
us going and saying like add additional
 
00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
descriptor add additional word here so
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
we know exactly which section we're
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
talking about I mean you'll see that a
 
00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:32.300 align:start position:0%
lot more and when we start getting into
 
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
rsa193e if we ever get to that section
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the spell
 
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.290 align:start position:0%
of the spell
um

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh we are prepared to do exactly what
 
00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:44.339 align:start position:0%
you just said throughout this document
 
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
and that's what we've done many times
 
00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:46.730 align:start position:0%
and that's what we've done many times
now

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
um having this this document that Jen
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
prepared is fabulous because it's really
 
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
helpful for that
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
um so as far as
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
far as the impact on the local level we
 
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate any local level because
 
00:41:58.849 --> 00:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
this is on our current practices this is
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
what we currently do we're just adding
 
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
that in
 
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
um I do since we're on a definition
 
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.329 align:start position:0%
um I do since we're on a definition
section

00:42:05.329 --> 00:42:05.339 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I think we could add in the word
 
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
adopted by the State Board of Education
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
to add further clarification and um or
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
we can add in or the course level back
 
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
in that language just to help
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
um with the committee's concern with
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
that I don't I don't think there's any
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
um issue with adding that back in great
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay let's keep moving on
 
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:29.339 align:start position:0%
um are there any other questions on that
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
page page three
 
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
yes represent Belcher thank you Mr chair
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
thank you again I just wanted to look
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
real quickly at line 32 that
 
00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:41.300 align:start position:0%
which which
 
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:44.339 align:start position:0%
the apology is all I'll hold for later
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
okay so anything else on page three
 
00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:50.750 align:start position:0%
okay so anything else on page three
representing

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
representing
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you take my
 
00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.109 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you take my
question

00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:54.119 --> 00:42:55.250 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
this occurs in in several different
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
places so it's a question not only
 
00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:01.700 align:start position:0%
specific to here
 
00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:05.579 align:start position:0%
where a particular RSA is replaced with
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
the words under this section it's not
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
because we well why is that and why
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we specify the RSA
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
um we did that because some of these
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
were disjointed in different rsas right
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
now so now we've we've combined them all
 
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
into the same section so you can refer
 
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
to it under the section and if we say
 
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
under the section it just kind of helps
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
us with or helps actually OLS as far as
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
not having to go in and renumber each
 
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
section every single time you make a
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
little change or add a different size so
 
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
um we felt as long as it's defined and
 
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
contained within this section it was
 
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
that was the appropriate kind of
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislative drafting so
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
um I do just since you're um the
 
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
superintendents had asked or had
 
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
requested that we add a definition of
 
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
transcripts because it is referred to on
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
page nine
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
um so we talk about the Statewide
 
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
assessment results of schools or
 
00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:59.390 align:start position:0%
assessment results of schools or
students

00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
um shall not be included in a school
 
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
students transcripts
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so we will add we would like to add a
 
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:08.579 align:start position:0%
definition on their requests and so do
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
you have that designed yet or
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
um if not could you get that to us yeah
 
00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
okay anything else on on that page three
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:32.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.609 --> 00:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
superintendents right down in the middle
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the page there's a section says other
 
00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:41.220 align:start position:0%
open-ended performance tasks and you
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
know looking back at this assessment
 
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.510 align:start position:0%
know looking back at this assessment
process

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
and uh the Senate version here is other
 
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.750 align:start position:0%
and uh the Senate version here is other
items

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
items
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
types identified by the department and
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
testing entity as necessary to
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate measure to appropriately
 
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
other item types is that specific to
 
00:45:09.359 --> 00:45:12.290 align:start position:0%
other item types is that specific to
what

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:14.569 --> 00:45:14.579 align:start position:0%
so other item types would be inclusive
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
of any other item type so we would be
 
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
able to develop with the testing vendor
 
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
that would appropriately measure student
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
learning so it's a more inclusive way of
 
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
including different ways of including
 
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
items on a test that we may not have
 
00:45:29.809 --> 00:45:29.819 align:start position:0%
thought of yet I think when when testing
 
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
first began you know over 100 years ago
 
00:45:34.089 --> 00:45:34.099 align:start position:0%
testing was primarily multiple choice
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
educational research has come quite a
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
ways in the last hundred years from you
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
know the original intelligence and IQ
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
tests that were developed that were
 
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
primarily multiple choice and especially
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
now that we're doing more things with
 
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
computers we have computer adaptive
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
testing it opens up different ways of
 
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
creating item Types on our tests so this
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
is just making sure that our statute is
 
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
flexible enough that as we create better
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
or further questions yes representative
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you are we still able to
 
00:46:08.089 --> 00:46:08.099 align:start position:0%
use the performance-based assessments
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
so the performance-based assessments
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
that was part of the PACE program was
 
00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
discontinued that was done under the
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
iada waiver the state may seek an
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
additional Ida waiver in the future
 
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
depending on what types of innovative
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
assessment strategies we might come up
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
with as an alternative to the
 
00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
traditional State Testing but currently
 
00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
we're not using pace
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
did that go through uh the legislative
 
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
action when the pace was removed
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's so right now I think language that
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
had allowed the PACE program to operate
 
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
is in the current statute we've modified
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
it a little bit to make sure that this
 
00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:46.740 align:start position:0%
still continues to remain open so if we
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
do a program like Pace in the future the
 
00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:53.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
was it was the discontinuation of the
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
PACE program done through legislative
 
00:47:01.609 --> 00:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
action no it was not it was part of the
 
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
federal program it was primarily funded
 
00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
through federal grants that we the state
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
no longer received
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
so this so the state department decided
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
that they were not getting funded in so
 
00:47:14.569 --> 00:47:14.579 align:start position:0%
they were not going to continue the
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
program we weren't able to continue the
 
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
program correct thank you
 
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
well we had a waiver for that from the
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
federal government didn't we we didn't
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
space yeah we had a waiver but in
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
addition to the waiver we had an
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
Innovative grant that allowed us to fund
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
the program and the department was not
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
receiving that Grant anymore
 
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden
 
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
the pace districts is how what initiated
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
performance-based assessment
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
but yet we don't have pace of the
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
support to the districts but we continue
 
00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
with having performance-based assessment
 
00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
so we have the option to have
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
performance-based item types as part of
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative McDonald thank you
 
00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
um moving downwards on the page it says
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
shall be clearly defined before
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
assessment procedures and that's in
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
current law and that language is removed
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
from this bill as amended so is that
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
altering the timeline or are standards
 
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
going to be developed before the
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
assessment takes place or can I
 
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
interpret this as standards a develops
 
00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
based on the test results so the
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
standards are the standards that were
 
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
adopted by the state board and depending
 
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
on the tests that we're looking at there
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
are different times so for example the
 
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
science standard for the Next Generation
 
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
science standards those were adopted in
 
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
the 2017-18 school year so all of our
 
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
science Testing since then has been
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
based off of that so that's the language
 
00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
where it says we have to have standards
 
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
first is because we build the test off
 
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
of the standards that teachers are using
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
so down the road if the state were to
 
00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
change those standards we'd have to
 
00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
build a new test based off those new
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
standards all right thank you
 
00:48:59.569 --> 00:48:59.579 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
regarding page four
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that's represent Damon
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
I don't completely understand your
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
answer to representative McDonald's
 
00:49:14.329 --> 00:49:14.339 align:start position:0%
question can you just revisit that
 
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
uh sequencing of developing the
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
assessment procedures
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
sure so the the first thing that you
 
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
have to do before you can build the test
 
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
is you have to know what it is that
 
00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
you're testing and so that's where the
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
standards come into play so with science
 
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
we use the Next Generation science
 
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
standards it's a very long comprehensive
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
document I used to be a high school
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
science teacher I've not read the full
 
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
document but I've read that portions
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
that were specific to what I taught
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
which was chemistry and physics but
 
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
essentially the standards outline what
 
00:49:47.329 --> 00:49:47.339 align:start position:0%
every student should be able to know and
 
00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
do at the end of a particular grade
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
level or course so for example what
 
00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
should first graders be able to do in
 
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
science at the end of first grade second
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
grade third grade and so on in science
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
we test at the end of fifth grade eighth
 
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
grade and then we test our 11th graders
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
so the science test is only given three
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
times throughout a student's academic
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
career and the science test is based
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
upon the set of Standards leading up to
 
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
that particular grade level so fifth
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
grade science tests would include
 
00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
science content that students should
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
have learned by the end of their fifth
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
grade year and that all comes from those
 
00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:22.940 align:start position:0%
stand standards
 
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
so follow-up so in the excuse me change
 
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to me that it's saying
 
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:40.089 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:50:40.089 --> 00:50:40.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
I'll just stop it I appreciate it for
 
00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
the further questions on that yes
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
represent Myler
 
00:50:50.329 --> 00:50:50.339 align:start position:0%
thank you uh on a
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
you've changed the uh word into in
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
consultation with Educators and
 
00:50:55.559 --> 00:50:56.870 align:start position:0%
consultation with Educators and
stakeholders

00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:50:59.089 --> 00:50:59.099 align:start position:0%
does that mean that it hasn't been
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
happening in the past are you just
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
trying to codify the practice so so I
 
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
had I think me and I were just talking
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
about this I think
 
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
we were trying to clarify this in this
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
section and then I think we went back in
 
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
and added a definition to Statewide
 
00:51:15.049 --> 00:51:15.059 align:start position:0%
academic standards so I think we could
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
probably stop this it said it says a
 
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:19.140 align:start position:0%
Statewide academic standards get rid of
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of that language and
 
00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.950 align:start position:0%
the rest of that language and
potentially

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
um just make sure that we're clarifying
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
that definition back on that scene that
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
first page because there was areas that
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
we were going through we were writing
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
this and they're like well I think just
 
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
having a definition so we can refer to
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
this throughout it because we use the
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
word standards again on the next page
 
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
um I I think so if we were just just
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
stop it right at standards and then get
 
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
rid of everything else I think we're all
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
set I'm I'm not in this agreement with
 
00:51:44.809 --> 00:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
the current language you've proposed
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
because I do think the issue of
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
Consulting with people who are going to
 
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
be implementing this should be part of
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
this language because I'm assuming the
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
department is it does not want to go on
 
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
and do it unilaterally without including
 
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
those who are actually going to be
 
00:52:05.329 --> 00:52:05.339 align:start position:0%
dealing with these standards so so I'm
 
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of what you currently
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
have in here I just had a question about
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
what in consultation means
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
and that's one question secondly Define
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
who the stakeholders are
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
because one of the one of the concerns I
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
have is whether or not in the
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
stakeholders I'm assuming you're talking
 
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
about parents Etc are students involved
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:32.300 align:start position:0%
because students bring to the
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
schoolhouse store a much higher level of
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of what their needs are
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
Etc and I think they're often it's often
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
overlooked and and we as adults try to
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
say well here's what you need to have
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
which is important no question about
 
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:50.339 align:start position:0%
that but they also have some sense of
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
perspective too so that so the question
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
I really have sorry uh the question the
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
question I have is really what does in
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
consultation mean and secondly how do
 
00:53:05.569 --> 00:53:05.579 align:start position:0%
you define the question of stakeholders
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
so we haven't done this process in a
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
number of years because it all the the
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
process of Consulting with the
 
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and Gathering feedback and
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
buying comes when you first adopt those
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
standards so if we go back to the 1718
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
year when we adopted the science
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
standards there was probably about a
 
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
year and a half long process that led up
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
to the State Board adopting those
 
00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
standards and I want to say there was
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
anywhere between maybe about eight or
 
00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:32.579 align:start position:0%
ten different dates that were a
 
00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
listening session around the state where
 
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
Department Representatives had gone out
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
and set up a day you know in a school or
 
00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
in a district or in a community center
 
00:53:44.329 --> 00:53:44.339 align:start position:0%
where they had parents and students and
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
teachers and community members come in
 
00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
and ask questions about the standards
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
and provide feedback so it was a fairly
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
lengthy process that occurred leading up
 
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
to that adoption we could certainly
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
codify that as a particular process but
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
it included I would say probably about a
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
year of public feedback yeah and again I
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear I I appreciate
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
that in consultation section because I
 
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
think that's what you have done
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
according to what you were just saying
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
and I think it needs and needs to be
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
codified here so that the there's no and
 
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
there's no impression here that the
 
00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
department is just is developing this
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
stuff in thin air and then say okay you
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
guys have to do this now so I I
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
right represent Tanner
 
00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:31.670 align:start position:0%
right represent Tanner
um

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that I I guess the my question here
 
00:54:38.089 --> 00:54:38.099 align:start position:0%
is the cut scores uh standardized cut
 
00:54:38.099 --> 00:54:39.589 align:start position:0%
is the cut scores uh standardized cut
scores

00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
scores
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not familiar with that term
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
is it I know that proficiency one of the
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things I'm finding with the
 
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
public is that they don't understand
 
00:54:54.049 --> 00:54:54.059 align:start position:0%
really what's the word proficiency what
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
is behind the word proficiency uh they
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
think proficiency is the same as passing
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
and it certainly is higher than passing
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
could you tell me what cut scores
 
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
standardized cut scores are and uh is it
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
something to do with setting the level
 
00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
of proficiency it is yeah so those two
 
00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
items go hand in hand the way that we
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
report out student performance on the
 
00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:22.140 align:start position:0%
assessment is through proficiency and
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's a scale
 
00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
so students fall within one of four
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
categories they are either below
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
proficient approaching proficient
 
00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
proficient or above proficient and each
 
00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
categories is set by a range of scores
 
00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
on the test so when we refer to
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
standardized cut scores it's the
 
00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
particular score on the test where a
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
student would need to meet that
 
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
particular cut score to go into that
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
next level of proficiency so if a
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
student is in a category that's below
 
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
proficient there would be a cut score on
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
the test where as that student passed
 
00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
that score they would move into the next
 
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
category of proficiency
 
00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:02.030 align:start position:0%
category of proficiency
yes

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
I think uh publicly it should be made
 
00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.069 align:start position:0%
I think uh publicly it should be made
more

00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
apparent what proficiency is that it's
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's really like a b b plus you know I
 
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:12.349 align:start position:0%
it's really like a b b plus you know I
mean

00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
part of it is we've all gone to school
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
and we've gone ABCD and now we see
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
proficient and as I said out in the
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
public people don't understand what
 
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
proficient is and one of the things that
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
we're starting to do with the test we're
 
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
working on more and better communication
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
out to parents specifically parents and
 
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
students and in understanding the
 
00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:31.140 align:start position:0%
assessment data and the assessment
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
scores one of the things that sometimes
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit challenging and trying to
 
00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:37.559 align:start position:0%
communicate the general definition of
 
00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
proficiency is you could have two
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
students that both have a proficient
 
00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
score on the particular test but they
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
have different strengths and weaknesses
 
00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
so they're proficient in say fifth grade
 
00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:50.099 align:start position:0%
math but one student may have different
 
00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
strengths and different weaknesses and
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
if they still fall within the same range
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
of scores and so that's where we're
 
00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
trying to provide more detailed
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
information about what it is that
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
students are really good at what is it
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
that they're a little bit more weak on
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
what do they need to work on and a lot
 
00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:05.339 align:start position:0%
of the information is in the
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
individualized score reports that go out
 
00:57:09.049 --> 00:57:09.059 align:start position:0%
to parents and then one of the things
 
00:57:10.609 --> 00:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
we're working on now as well is trying
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
to take those score reports and create a
 
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
video format that we can provide to
 
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
parents that's more explanatory of what
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
is on the assessment and how did your
 
00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
particular student do what did they
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
really excel at and what is it that they
 
00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:25.700 align:start position:0%
can continue to work on
 
00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.349 align:start position:0%
can continue to work on
mm-hmm

00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
00:57:29.569 --> 00:57:29.579 align:start position:0%
so I I don't think
 
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
I think what we're doing on on uh giving
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
information to parents and continuing to
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
improve that and the information is to
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
teachers is very vital but where it
 
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
comes back at us is with the public and
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
when you say you know 20 only 30 percent
 
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
of students are reading at the
 
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
proficient level on something in in New
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a whole or in x y and z
 
00:57:55.319 --> 00:57:56.870 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a whole or in x y and z
school

00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't give a full picture to
 
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
the public uh because they don't
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
understand uh what proficient is but
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's another day I think to remember
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
you that you're concerned I think what
 
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
we can do is propose a definition of
 
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
okay representative you can then
 
00:58:20.809 --> 00:58:20.819 align:start position:0%
representative Cass Academy thanks very
 
00:58:20.819 --> 00:58:21.650 align:start position:0%
representative Cass Academy thanks very
much

00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair
 
00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:26.339 align:start position:0%
um just sort of a follow-up to um uh to
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner's questions
 
00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
um regarding cut scores at a um
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
at an ncsl chairs meeting that I was at
 
00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
last October
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
um they reported out that New Hampshire
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
is in the process of proposing to raise
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
the cut scores I'm actually reading from
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
a slide raise the cut scores used to uh
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
award a school a score from one to four
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
for the academic achievement and other
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
academic indicators and I was wondering
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
um where we stand in terms of that
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
proposal right now
 
00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
so that that's a little bit different
 
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
than the standardized cut scores on the
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
test so those are not changing those
 
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
have all been set by the standard
 
00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:10.140 align:start position:0%
setting that we did a number of years
 
00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
ago with teachers what we did propose
 
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
this past year was modifying the the
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
limits at which we're identifying the
 
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
schools that are the lowest performing
 
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
schools in the state and that uses a
 
00:59:22.849 --> 00:59:22.859 align:start position:0%
range of different indicators one of
 
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
which is academic achievement we have a
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
federal requirement that we have to
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
identify no less than five percent of
 
00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
the lowest performing schools in the
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
state and the current cut scores we were
 
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
using did not identify five percent it
 
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:38.220 align:start position:0%
was actually below that and so we by
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
using the scores we currently had we
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't identify five percent so we
 
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
were out of compliance with federal
 
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
statute so what we did was we looked at
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
the performance of schools across the
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
state and tried to identify about where
 
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
would performance be if we had to
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
identify that five percent and we moved
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
our indicator scores up to that point it
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
was a small change but it brought us
 
00:59:59.150 --> 00:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
back into compliance with federal
 
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
statute it did not in any way affect
 
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
student performance or the scores that
 
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
students had received to be proficient
 
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm going to follow up on that
 
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
if I made so so
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
in those cases
 
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
that that cut line that five percent cut
 
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
line is to and and um the the
 
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
um the the term is is evading me right
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
now CSI CSI yes not a CSI cut line yes
 
01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
it is okay thank you
 
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden you had your
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
um yes just to add a little bit to what
 
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner was saying at
 
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
least five years ago
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
um schools transitioned their report
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
cards sort of speaker they're reporting
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
to parents in the proficiency levels
 
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
with the explanation so that some some
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
schools do quarters still most
 
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
elementary schools do trimesters now
 
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
but all that explanation of proficiency
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
is has been provided at least for the
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
five the past five years but I
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
understand that the public looks at the
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
negative part but I'm wondering if that
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
public are those parents who weren't
 
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
informed enough of the levels of
 
01:01:15.289 --> 01:01:15.299 align:start position:0%
proficiency because
 
01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
they have it if they have kids in public
 
01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:18.950 align:start position:0%
they have it if they have kids in public
school

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
so I I'm just trying to sort through as
 
01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
a public school system not educating
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
their parents enough on it but levels of
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
proficiency has been a reporting
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
mechanism for at least five years
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
multiple times a year
 
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
to those parents so I don't I know
 
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
that's there
 
01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:46.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:48.849 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:01:48.849 --> 01:01:48.859 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
ready to move on to the next page
 
01:01:52.849 --> 01:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
because some of this is kind of re you
 
01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
know repeat itself again two pages later
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
you're gonna see the word consultation
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
again appear up and there'll be more
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
discussion on that so yes representative
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you uh they think just a
 
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
clarification orange sure I think I must
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
have heard it wrong did you say that the
 
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
we had a level of cut scores that
 
01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:14.700 align:start position:0%
identified the lowest five percent
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
performing schools but because we
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't identify private scent we
 
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
increased the cut scores we can meet the
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
federal language we have that many
 
01:02:22.559 --> 01:02:24.530 align:start position:0%
federal language we have that many
failing

01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
failing
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so when we initially created that
 
01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
first cut score is when we first moved
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
from New York Child Left Behind to Essa
 
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
and so there wasn't really a good sense
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
of what our data was going to look like
 
01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:35.579 align:start position:0%
so we didn't know where to set the cut
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
score so the cut score was set on
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
theoretically what would identify five
 
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
percent of schools three years from the
 
01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
date the cut score was set and when we
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
got to that date it turns out we picked
 
01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
the wrong number so it truly was it
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
wasn't that that number was based off of
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
anything hard it was sort of a
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
subjective number and we knew down the
 
01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
road most likely we would have to vary
 
01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
the number a little bit to make sure
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
that we were capturing the schools that
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
need the most support one of the things
 
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we do is
 
01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
really specifically identify those
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
schools that are within that bottom five
 
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
percent because there's some significant
 
01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
Federal funding that then goes out to
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
those schools and so
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
that the funding is really attached to
 
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're providing the
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
most support to the schools that need it
 
01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
the most
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
hey thank you Mr chair so how are you
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
doing in the high school when I don't
 
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
know if the SAT or the ACT is part of
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
this equation here because you're
 
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
talking about again grade level
 
01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:31.010 align:start position:0%
talking about again grade level
expectations

01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
expectations
 
01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
um are you giving a PSAT prior to the
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
sat in the 10th grade and then the sat
 
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
in the 11th and and is that part of the
 
01:03:41.289 --> 01:03:41.299 align:start position:0%
statement because in the previous
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
academic standard specified what
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
students should no one be able to do
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
shall be clearly defined before
 
01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
assessment procedures and exercises are
 
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:52.430 align:start position:0%
assessment procedures and exercises are
developed

01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
developed
 
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
is the SAT giving back what we're trying
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
to find out or are we doing that in
 
01:03:58.730 --> 01:03:58.740 align:start position:0%
terms of seeing if these kids are
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
prepared for the first year of college
 
01:04:03.049 --> 01:04:03.059 align:start position:0%
so there's four indicators at the high
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
school level that all factor into the
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
formula for identifying high schools for
 
01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
that bottom five percent the SAT would
 
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
be one component so we look at academic
 
01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
achievement and that would be on the
 
01:04:14.569 --> 01:04:14.579 align:start position:0%
reading math and Essay sections of the
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
SAT we also look at graduation rate so a
 
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
school that has a very low graduation
 
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:22.140 align:start position:0%
rate could also be and end up being
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
identified within that five percent
 
01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:26.339 align:start position:0%
because that's one factor we look at we
 
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
look at the performance of our English
 
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:30.299 align:start position:0%
language Learners on the access test and
 
01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
we look to see how many of those
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
students are approaching proficiency
 
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
with English at the high school level
 
01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
and then we also have a number of
 
01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
College and Career ready factors that we
 
01:04:40.930 --> 01:04:40.940 align:start position:0%
look at I believe there's 11
 
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
there's 11 factors and so by the time a
 
01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
student has reached the end of their
 
01:04:47.329 --> 01:04:47.339 align:start position:0%
senior Year we're looking to see how
 
01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
many of those students have met two out
 
01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
of those 11 factors they include things
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
like taking a dual and concurrent
 
01:04:55.609 --> 01:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
enrollment course earning a certain
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
score on an AP test earning a certain
 
01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
score on the ASVAB test so there's a
 
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:02.579 align:start position:0%
variety of those indicators that uh task
 
01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
force a number of years came up with
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
before the set of students are doing two
 
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
or more of those items they're more
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
likely to be College and Career ready
 
01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
than a student who hasn't met anything
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
on the list
 
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
those four indicators all together uh
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
there's a formula we put together to
 
01:05:19.490 --> 01:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
identify what are the high schools in
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
the state that need the most support
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
because they have the lowest scores
 
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
across those four indicators
 
01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:28.140 align:start position:0%
thank you yes represent Luna just to
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
follow up on what well you just asked
 
01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:33.299 align:start position:0%
here because I think I think that I
 
01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
think I'll just speak for myself I just
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
heard some very important information
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
that sort of connects the relationship
 
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
between well those are the delivery
 
01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
indicators of an adequate education
 
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
right right but it's not and it cuts and
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
it goes all the way down to the student
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
outcome proficiency scores in the CSI
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
cut scores and uh clearly all of these
 
01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
things are are linked all the way back
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
to through to assessment and academic
 
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
standards and adequacy
 
01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.730 align:start position:0%
standards and adequacy
hmm

01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
and and I I was I was wondering if it
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
might make sense and we don't have to
 
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
get it today because you've just given
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
us a little bit of verbal on it but a
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
maybe a short
 
01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.789 align:start position:0%
maybe a short
um

01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
report or summary of of how these things
 
01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
are are connected because it's going to
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
be really
 
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
um I think as we go through and evaluate
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
the academic standards it's important to
 
01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
to recognize how it all trickles back to
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
um through assessment and student
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
outcome Cuts proficiency cut scores and
 
01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.849 --> 01:06:46.859 align:start position:0%
yeah I you know I'm following what
 
01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
you're saying but I'm again concerned
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
that the indicators which we're talking
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
about come at the end of a student's
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
traveling through High School they're at
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
the end graduation rates as a CTE dual
 
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment those are not
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
going to be giving us information like
 
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
the Statewide assessment that you're
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
talking about gives individual student
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
information back as well we're talking
 
01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
about aggregate stuff at the end for a
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
high school so it doesn't in terms turn
 
01:07:19.609 --> 01:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
around and say this is what we have to
 
01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
do to try to better ourselves in
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
10th grade ninth grade or any other
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
grade it just says overall your schools
 
01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
has a crummy graduation right here this
 
01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
are a wonderful graduation rate
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
and that's and that's that's School
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
related that school specific data not
 
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
student-specific data that's right but
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
it does relate to I think you know the C
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
you know an indicator for the for the
 
01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
CSI it does yeah so those pieces taken
 
01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
together that that represents the
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability so that
 
01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:52.140 align:start position:0%
pbath so when we were talking about 193
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
3B that's the accountability for an
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
01:07:58.849 --> 01:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
the criteria for CSI or TSI or ATS
 
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
schools that is our performance-based
 
01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
accountability system and the data that
 
01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
goes along with that
 
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:05.579 align:start position:0%
um and I so I know that this is a very
 
01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
short kind of verbal explanation about
 
01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
this um but I will call out one of my
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues here
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
um kirian Guang who works uh within our
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
Bureau has created a set of uh 12 videos
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
sort of an accountability 101 on our
 
01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.950 align:start position:0%
sort of an accountability 101 on our
system

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
um that we could make available to this
 
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
committee as well that we've put out on
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
the website for school leaders to who
 
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
also have similar questions that want to
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
understand the accountability system
 
01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.150 align:start position:0%
understand the accountability system
better

01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
but that sat doesn't get proficiency one
 
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
two three or four levels so it doesn't
 
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
give us that information about a student
 
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
it does so because we because we use the
 
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
SAT for our Statewide assessment we went
 
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:44.339 align:start position:0%
through the same standard setting
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
process with our high school teachers
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
and we identified different ranges of
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
scores on the SAT that would correlate
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
to proficiency at the junior level of
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
high school so depending on what a
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
student scores on the SAT they will
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
still fall into a bucket of being below
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
proficient approaching proficient or
 
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
above proficient wouldn't it be more
 
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
useful than if we did it off the PSAT in
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
the 10th grade so we can use some data
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
to help us get those kids through grades
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
11 and 12. many students do take the
 
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
PSAT within schools a lot of districts
 
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
offer that as preparation for leading up
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
to the SAT to do that at a state level
 
01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
again would just be an additional
 
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
Financial cost that we would have to
 
01:09:26.209 --> 01:09:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.289 --> 01:09:30.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:32.219 align:start position:0%
I know it I mean we give it a ninth
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
grade but it does I mean the district
 
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
has to pop buy it yeah
 
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
okay one brief follow-up sure one that
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
bit of data thank you for taking my
 
01:09:45.169 --> 01:09:45.179 align:start position:0%
question one bit of data that I haven't
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
heard mentioned is any correlation
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
between teacher preparation and student
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
performance it seems to me that we're
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
not looking at the full picture if we're
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
not also considering that
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
I think in particular the fact that
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
English language Learners are often
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
taught by people who themselves have
 
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
never been required to learn another
 
01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:08.990 align:start position:0%
never been required to learn another
language

01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
we we had a a pretty good discussion on
 
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
this with the higher education committee
 
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
the other day on Friday
 
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
we went all morning on that topic so
 
01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
let's just jump over it right now and
 
01:10:24.169 --> 01:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
and Coach page five is there anything on
 
01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:27.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
so yeah so we're in the assessment
 
01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:58.010 align:start position:0%
so yeah so we're in the assessment
section

01:10:58.010 --> 01:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
um so we removed this because it's
 
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
already referred to in the adequacy
 
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
section and we didn't need to find in
 
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
both sections so adequacy refers back to
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
the third grade reading assessment and
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
we don't need that here so
 
01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:12.310 align:start position:0%
we don't need that here so
foreign

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the third grade funding
 
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
and adequacy so it was not done in
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
correlation with that that happened it
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
also happens to be being proposed in a
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
budget simultaneously but we just said
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
we were trying to remove duplicative
 
01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:29.390 align:start position:0%
we were trying to remove duplicative
language

01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
what about page seven
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
I think there's some questions here
 
01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
um in the in the first one where it says
 
01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:38.179 align:start position:0%
rule making
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
the state board and education that was
 
01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
in rules shall adopt rules this one says
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
may adopt rules why did you change it to
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
me we changed it because we don't
 
01:11:48.649 --> 01:11:48.659 align:start position:0%
currently have assessment rules and we
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
are functioning well we believe
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
um so we wanted to make that a May in
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
case we did think we needed that
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
clarification further but we don't
 
01:11:58.130 --> 01:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
currently have rules and don't feel that
 
01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
well I congratulate you on that one we
 
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
don't need any more rules we agree okay
 
01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
um areas of assessment
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
this is where we knocked out history
 
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
geography civics economics Etc
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
from the Statewide assessment years ago
 
01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not prepared to yeah I don't think
 
01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's a change here we literally just
 
01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
combined the two we added an and and
 
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
then so we just it just reads together
 
01:12:39.169 --> 01:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
as one sentence rather than two
 
01:12:39.179 --> 01:12:43.970 align:start position:0%
as one sentence rather than two
sentences

01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
well they they are different
 
01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
there's a huge difference between the
 
01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
first sentence and the second sentence
 
01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
one's local school
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
one Statewide assessment dealing with
 
01:12:59.570 --> 01:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
the reading language arts mathematics
 
01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
and science
 
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
the history all that so that's where we
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
are right now I understand that
 
01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:09.229 align:start position:0%
are right now I understand that
um

01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
I guess my my biggest concerns on this
 
01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:15.020 align:start position:0%
page are on the bottom section there
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
and that that is where we had Pace
 
01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
before or a norm reference assessment
 
01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
which could be used by a district in
 
01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
consultation with the department and
 
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
that would be considered part of the
 
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
Statewide Assessment program So
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
currently um the process of the
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
department follows for that is a process
 
01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
that we do that in consultation with the
 
01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
U.S Department of Education
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
um so right now the current law just
 
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
talks about that we're allowed to do
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
that but it doesn't actually refer to
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
the process being a process that needs
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
to be enabled by the US Department of
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
Education even though that has been the
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
process that was approved and used for
 
01:13:58.729 --> 01:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
the pace process so all we did was
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
clarify that it was if a process is
 
01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
offered by the U.S Department of
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
Education and so there is currently
 
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
language right now in the essel law that
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
enables the school district to do this
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
but if they reauthorize us into
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
something else five or six years ago
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
from now and they remove that language
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
we won't be able to have that Authority
 
01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of we just add some Flex
 
01:14:21.410 --> 01:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
disability we didn't feel that this
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
changed the current process at all
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
um it just felt like it just kind of
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
explained what we were currently doing
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
yes representative so so with the
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
removal of this language
 
01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
uh will uh school districts still be
 
01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
allowed to uh do their own assessment
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
so in order for a school district to do
 
01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
their own assessment it has to be
 
01:14:48.649 --> 01:14:48.659 align:start position:0%
approved through a waiver process and
 
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
that's the clarification we made here so
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
districts can't just on their own go out
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
and do their own locally developed
 
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
assessment in place of the state
 
01:14:59.209 --> 01:14:59.219 align:start position:0%
assessment if they were doing that they
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
would be in violation of many of the
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
requirements of our title programs that
 
01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
would not be able to continue to receive
 
01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
federal funding as a school so that's
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
the the clarification here is yes
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
schools can do an alternative Innovative
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
assessment if it's approved through the
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
department of the U.S Department of
 
01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.570 align:start position:0%
department of the U.S Department of
Education

01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:16.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:18.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
it has to be approved through the U.S
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
department not through the state
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
department our state department so
 
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
generally the process is and this is
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
what we did with pace is we wrote a plan
 
01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
out uh for how we were going to do pace
 
01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
and then we submitted that to the US
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and they
 
01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
approved a waiver that allowed the pace
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
districts to administer the pace
 
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
assessment as an alternative to the
 
01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
state assessment and we need that waiver
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
process because schools are required to
 
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
participate in the state assessment
 
01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:48.179 align:start position:0%
process in exchange for receiving title
 
01:15:51.169 --> 01:15:51.179 align:start position:0%
dollars and so if a school outside of
 
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
that waiver process were to create their
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
own test and stop using the state
 
01:15:56.689 --> 01:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
assessment they would not be able to
 
01:15:58.370 --> 01:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
continue to receive that Federal funding
 
01:15:59.630 --> 01:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
that they received through the title
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
programs do they do they receive that
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
waiver by going through you as a conduit
 
01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
yes to get that waiver it's our
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
department that submits the waiver yes
 
01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:12.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
I would just suggest that you have
 
01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
language in there that says it's through
 
01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
a waiver process just to clarify it
 
01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:21.709 align:start position:0%
a waiver process just to clarify it
um

01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
and schools again can still do
 
01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
Performance Based assessments if they go
 
01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
through the waiver process with the U.S
 
01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
but we don't do pace
 
01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
so it would be it would be the New
 
01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education I
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
would have to submit that waiver right
 
01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
so we currently do not have a waiver in
 
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
place to be okay so the department
 
01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:46.140 align:start position:0%
would determine whether that goes to the
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
federal level or not yes yeah and
 
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
generally we look to our stakeholder
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
groups things like the state
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
accountability task force to determine
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
you know are we going to submit a waiver
 
01:16:57.709 --> 01:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
what might that look like what could a
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
program be
 
01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:00.659 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of I think discussion
 
01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
with the field initially when we began
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
pace so what that's going to look like
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
how schools will implement it and the
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
structure of the particular waiver that
 
01:17:10.729 --> 01:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative Woodcock and then
 
01:17:12.719 --> 01:17:14.169 align:start position:0%
yes representative Woodcock and then
representing

01:17:14.169 --> 01:17:14.179 align:start position:0%
representing
 
01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the last block and going
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
back to that that line it says if such a
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
program is offered by the department so
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
did I understand you just say that that
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
means if you already have a waiver uh in
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
the department already so what that
 
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
means yes so they couldn't create
 
01:17:34.729 --> 01:17:34.739 align:start position:0%
the department create a new waiver
 
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
request by a local school district or to
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
have three summons already in place
 
01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
so we could one of the requirements when
 
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
we initially did Pace was that we had to
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
show not only you know was it a viable
 
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
alternative to the state assessment but
 
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
it was something that could be scaled up
 
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
and eventually become Statewide and so
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
you couldn't put something into place at
 
01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
only one school district would do you
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
would have to show through that waiver
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
process that it's something that would
 
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
be scalable in the state and that
 
01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:03.659 align:start position:0%
multiple districts would want to take
 
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
advantage of that that was one of the
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
challenges with the the PACE program is
 
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
we had a ceiling in terms of the number
 
01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
of districts that wanted to participate
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
in the program as an alternative to the
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
state assessment
 
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
so if I'm reading this correctly
 
01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:26.699 align:start position:0%
there is a significant reduction in the
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
amount of assessment because the current
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
law has three grade levels where
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
assessment happens and the draft
 
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
language has just two is that correct
 
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to clarify because it did
 
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
seem like it was a little bit vague in
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
the original statute so right now we
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
administer the state assessment in
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
grades three through eight and then once
 
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
in the junior year for Math and Ela and
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
then science is grades 5 8 and 11. so
 
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
science specifically is just three
 
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:57.659 align:start position:0%
grades and that follows the federal
 
01:18:59.330 --> 01:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
requirements so those are grades we're
 
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
required to assess students in
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
oh yep
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
so in the original language when it says
 
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
once in an elementary school grade once
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
in a middle school grade and one grade
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
in high school that is not what is
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
happening is that what you just told me
 
01:19:15.490 --> 01:19:15.500 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
and so what's in the new languages what
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
is currently happening yes not a
 
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
reduction in practice correct yeah so
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
this is one of the changes we made to
 
01:19:26.689 --> 01:19:26.699 align:start position:0%
bring our current state statute in line
 
01:19:28.970 --> 01:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
with current practice it may be that
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
some of this language in the current
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
statute was a holdover from No Child
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
Left Behind where assessment
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
requirements from the feds may have been
 
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
a little bit different than it is now
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
with Essa but currently we assess in all
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
those grades three through eight and
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's a requirement of our federal
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
Assessment program
 
01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
so we weren't in violation necessarily
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
State Statute we were just the federal
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
law was more expansive than what was in
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
our current state statute and we wanted
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
to align those two together with this
 
01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.490 align:start position:0%
to align those two together with this
change

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:19:58.729 --> 01:19:58.739 align:start position:0%
thank you this this is a real departure
 
01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
from what we I I remember writing this
 
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
section myself with Gene Chandler
 
01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.110 align:start position:0%
section myself with Gene Chandler
and

01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:08.689 --> 01:20:08.699 align:start position:0%
it gives the opportunity to a local
 
01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
school district we want to use a
 
01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:14.219 align:start position:0%
different assessment we'll consult with
 
01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
the department so we'll be part of the
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide Assessment program but we're
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
going to move ahead and use the Iowa
 
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
Test basic skills Stanford we're going
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
to use California achievement whatever
 
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
test they want to do and and yes they
 
01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
may not receive federal dollars they may
 
01:20:33.250 --> 01:20:33.260 align:start position:0%
not want the federal dollars
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
but this this allows them to just do
 
01:20:38.169 --> 01:20:38.179 align:start position:0%
this very thing
 
01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
and the way it is right now they can
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
only do it if it's offered by the
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
department and approved by the United
 
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
States Department of Education so this
 
01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
was a real effort on the part to really
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
go to local control
 
01:20:56.290 --> 01:20:56.300 align:start position:0%
in terms of this assessment instrument
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
now that's being taken away
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
it will no longer you know if you're
 
01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:03.659 align:start position:0%
using some other assessment in your
 
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
school that will no longer be an
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
assessment you can use if you're not
 
01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
using the Statewide assessment
 
01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:13.430 align:start position:0%
using the Statewide assessment
so

01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
yes I think the way that to your point
 
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
the way that was originally written a
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
school could say we're not going to use
 
01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
the state test we're not going to go
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
through the waiver process we're just
 
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
going to use say that Iowa Test of Basic
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
Skills uh we understand we're not going
 
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
to receive federal funds we're not going
 
01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
to take the federal funds
 
01:21:32.209 --> 01:21:32.219 align:start position:0%
um so they and that would be all across
 
01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
all their title programs so title one
 
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
two four the other issue with that
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
though is that we would lose data on
 
01:21:41.209 --> 01:21:41.219 align:start position:0%
that particular school because our state
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
assessment system we've gone through and
 
01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
done some pretty rigorous standard
 
01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
setting over the course of of multiple
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
years in terms of constructing these
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
tests we don't have any of that data on
 
01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
any of these other assessments so we
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know what particular scores on
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
those assessments equate to proficiency
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
or not proficiency we wouldn't have a
 
01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
way of getting the scores from those
 
01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
other tests districts are using through
 
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
our current data portals so we wouldn't
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
have any way of reporting out the data
 
01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
so essentially those schools would kind
 
01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
of almost become like little black holes
 
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
of data within the state and we wouldn't
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
be able to compare them across any other
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
schools in the state because they'd be
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
using different assessments
 
01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
see the background on this was back when
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
we're doing smarter balanced building
 
01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
and when Common Core came in effect
 
01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
there were some districts very upset
 
01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
over having to so the the up their Annie
 
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
they went beyond the standards and then
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to go the direction of their own
 
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
that's when Pace came into play
 
01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
um so it seems to me we're just kind of
 
01:22:42.649 --> 01:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
moving away from that concept
 
01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:45.179 align:start position:0%
um and everybody's going to have to do
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
the same thing the other thing that was
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
in it so
 
01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
sorry no go ahead representative
 
01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:56.149 align:start position:0%
sorry no go ahead representative
no

01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.159 --> 01:22:57.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
since the department doesn't support
 
01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:02.219 align:start position:0%
Pace districts any longer do you still
 
01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
have districts in the state or do you
 
01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
have any idea how many we'll use a p-bat
 
01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
pbas system
 
01:23:11.689 --> 01:23:11.699 align:start position:0%
so all schools are required to use the
 
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
pbas system and that's based off of all
 
01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
the different indicators within the Essa
 
01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:17.630 align:start position:0%
the different indicators within the Essa
plan

01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
um so it's not based off of uh Pace when
 
01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
we had Pace districts their scores were
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
equated with the state assessment scores
 
01:23:27.649 --> 01:23:27.659 align:start position:0%
um and that was one of the reasons why
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
it became challenging to continue to use
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
Pace when the Federal grant went away
 
01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
because there was a significant chunk of
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
money that we had to pay to a vendor to
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
be able to take the pace scores do a
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
statistical analysis of those scores and
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
equate them to the scores of students
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
taking the regular assessment so that
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
they could all be reported together and
 
01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
you could compare a pay school to a
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
Traditional School using the traditional
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
assessments without those dollars
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
without the ability to do all that
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
statistical analysis we weren't able to
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
we would have had to run two different
 
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
accountability systems and the
 
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
accountability law within State Statute
 
01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
still requires schools to meet all the
 
01:24:06.410 --> 01:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
different state accountability
 
01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
requirements which are currently based
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
off of our state assessment so there's a
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
question there of what would
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
accountability look like for a school
 
01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
that might be using a different system
 
01:24:17.810 --> 01:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
we were able to build a lot of that with
 
01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
Pace using the money that we had without
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
having a pretty significant investment
 
01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
of money it's very difficult to do
 
01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
comparisons of multiple assessment and
 
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
accountability systems
 
01:24:31.450 --> 01:24:31.460 align:start position:0%
but yet schools need to do both
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
input-based and Performance Based now
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
where at one point they had a choice
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
they did have a choice I think it was up
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
until 2019 and it was changed and so now
 
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
that they have to do the
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
which is aligned to this assessment if
 
01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a way to compare them
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
they automatically would fail pbas in
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
theory or they would have to be exempt
 
01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
which there's no ability to exempt to
 
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
school right now from the
 
01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
 
01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
and so we would not be able to measure
 
01:24:59.209 --> 01:24:59.219 align:start position:0%
them and and then ensure that they're
 
01:25:04.090 --> 01:25:04.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.130 --> 01:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
I think we need to pause for a moment
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
here we viewed the term pace
 
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
throughout this morning in my sense as
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
members of this committee have no idea
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
what you're even talking about
 
01:25:18.130 --> 01:25:18.140 align:start position:0%
um so could you so could you please
 
01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:21.860 align:start position:0%
could you please define the PACE program
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
why it was done because I think we've
 
01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
used it several times this morning and I
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
think it's very relevant to the
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
conversation we're having here thank you
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh pace is an acronym it stood
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
for performance assessment of Competency
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
education and the PACE program was a
 
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
specific program that used
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
performance-based Assessments in place
 
01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:45.140 align:start position:0%
of the state assessment
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
performance-based assessments require a
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
student to be engaged in a more real
 
01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
world type problem that may require them
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
to create or to think critically about a
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
particular situation and answer multiple
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
questions involved with a particular
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
performance task it's a little bit more
 
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
involved than a traditional say multiple
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
choice test so there is a difference in
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
the type of assessment it also requires
 
01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.510 align:start position:0%
the type of assessment it also requires
more

01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.169 align:start position:0%
more
um

01:26:12.169 --> 01:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
work on the part of teachers because
 
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
you're grading that performance
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
assessment through the use of rubrics
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
and coming up with a score that you can
 
01:26:23.629 --> 01:26:23.639 align:start position:0%
then use for accountability
 
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
um it was run for a number of years we
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
had a number of pace districts that were
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
using those performance tasks in place
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
Department let me just clarify so the
 
01:26:39.290 --> 01:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
department had um received the waiver we
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
were talking from the U.S Department of
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
Education to use this in place of our
 
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
our traditional State assessment system
 
01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
so as we went through the whole process
 
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
of applying to the US Department of
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
Education receiving that later process
 
01:26:51.649 --> 01:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
we'd also received some large grants I
 
01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
believe was you know multi-million
 
01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
dollar grants from Nelly May and a few
 
01:26:58.189 --> 01:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
other National Partners I was funded
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
this program and as over time you know
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't have the funding to continue
 
01:27:04.129 --> 01:27:04.139 align:start position:0%
this program and it kind of just
 
01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:05.639 align:start position:0%
expressed some of the kind of the
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
challenges of that we could no longer
 
01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
implement the program so now the
 
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
department discontinued Pace but is
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
still implementing a Statewide
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
assessment which is just our regular
 
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment in the grades three
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
through eight and eleven it's called the
 
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire SAS if I may and just to
 
01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
clarify so students would then have to
 
01:27:26.209 --> 01:27:26.219 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they they they can
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
perform the competency or demonstrate
 
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
the competency is a bit different than
 
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
just marking a an exam of a multiple
 
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
choice it was a much deeper level of
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
understanding of whatever the topic
 
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
might be that they were studying and I
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
think at the time it really became a
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
model for the nation as it relates to
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
these competency-based education so I
 
01:27:51.169 --> 01:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
just thank you for the clarification I
 
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
think people Now understand a little bit
 
01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
more represent Lucas
 
01:27:57.950 --> 01:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
is there a reason we can't just have the
 
01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:58.970 align:start position:0%
is there a reason we can't just have the
whole

01:27:58.970 --> 01:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
so we're not having to compare two
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
systems just that sounds like a much
 
01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
better system to me
 
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's much more expensive
 
01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:13.450 align:start position:0%
it's much more expensive
okay

01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:13.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
even if you're not trying to compare
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
the two systems if you're just using
 
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
that it's still more expensive because
 
01:28:25.129 --> 01:28:25.139 align:start position:0%
why the costs are not associated the the
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
higher costs not the cost of using both
 
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
systems it was the the cost of
 
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
implementing the system in general
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
um so it's part yeah part of the reason
 
01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
so the the state assessment is
 
01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
administered through
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
um computers it's digital it's adaptive
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
so as students move through the
 
01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
assessment depending on how they're
 
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
answering questions on that state test
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
the test is automatically going to
 
01:28:46.129 --> 01:28:46.139 align:start position:0%
either give them more challenging or
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
slightly easier questions as the test
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
identifies where the student's
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
proficiency lies and that's once you've
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
built the test it's really just kind of
 
01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining that system and keeping it
 
01:28:59.330 --> 01:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
going with performance-based tasks you
 
01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
have to generate new performance tasks
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
for students at every grade level every
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
year and you have to train all the
 
01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
teachers who are going to be
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
administering those so the training
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
requirements of being able to work with
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
those teachers train them develop the
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
items and then do all the grading
 
01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
because you have to have multiple
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
teachers individually great paid those
 
01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:19.139 align:start position:0%
items after the students completed them
 
01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
the time commitment to the resources and
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
the training was significantly larger
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
than the state assessment system and
 
01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
that was one of the reasons why I became
 
01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
challenging to get more districts to buy
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
into it because of the time commitment
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
and the training commitment on their
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
teachers without so we were paying
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
teachers additional money to do the
 
01:29:39.410 --> 01:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
training to do the scoring to be
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
involved in that
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
further questions on on this page
 
01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
on the last uh at the bottom of page
 
01:30:11.450 --> 01:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
eight there's a Roman five it says
 
01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
Department shall provide the testing
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
entity with individual pupil names and
 
01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
unique pupil identifiers
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
and other student demographic
 
01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
or statistical information what what do
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
you mean by other
 
01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
sure so one of the reasons that we've
 
01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
added that in is the assessment vendor
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
that we use for this at the end of every
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
year when they go through the data they
 
01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
do a lot of statistical analysis for us
 
01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the test is valid and
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
reliable and one of the things that they
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
do for many of the other states but not
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire is they look to see
 
01:30:48.169 --> 01:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
how are students performing on
 
01:30:50.209 --> 01:30:50.219 align:start position:0%
individual test questions based upon
 
01:30:52.370 --> 01:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
their demographics so for example if
 
01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
we're looking at free and reduced lunch
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
students you know students in our lower
 
01:30:57.649 --> 01:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic groups how are they
 
01:30:59.450 --> 01:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
performing across each of the different
 
01:31:01.490 --> 01:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
questions that students in those groups
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
are seeing but because our vendor
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that kind of demographic
 
01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:07.139 align:start position:0%
information they can't provide us with
 
01:31:09.649 --> 01:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
that level of analysis on the exam and
 
01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
that's something that they do for all of
 
01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
the other states that use our test New
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only one that we're not
 
01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:16.280 align:start position:0%
able to receive some of that information
 
01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
we've worked with U.S Department of
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
Education on this it is a requirement of
 
01:31:22.669 --> 01:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
peer review for State exams you provide
 
01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
that level of statistical analysis what
 
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
we've done in the past is we've provided
 
01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
the U.S Department of Education with
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
information from other states that also
 
01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
use this test but unfortunately that's
 
01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
just a best guess as to how those groups
 
01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire would be performing
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
because we don't have that analysis so I
 
01:31:41.209 --> 01:31:41.219 align:start position:0%
think providing this information would
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
just it gives us another level of
 
01:31:44.450 --> 01:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
looking at the test and making sure the
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
test is really performing the way that
 
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
we want it to and that students are
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
performing across all the different
 
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
questions that we've built into the test
 
01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I don't have it in front of
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
me but several years ago we revised
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
language in terms of what data we could
 
01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
provide the testing entity
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
and we mentioned address earlier but I
 
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
don't recall anything being put into
 
01:32:14.649 --> 01:32:14.659 align:start position:0%
statute about providing this other
 
01:32:17.689 --> 01:32:17.699 align:start position:0%
demographic data related to those
 
01:32:20.209 --> 01:32:20.219 align:start position:0%
students can you help me with that
 
01:32:22.010 --> 01:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
so that that would be a new change is
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
providing those additional demographic
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
variables so that the testing vendor is
 
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
not necessarily going to be looking at
 
01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
individual students they're looking to
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
see groups of students so you know on
 
01:32:33.649 --> 01:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
particular questions if you have a
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
question that performs well in one
 
01:32:38.689 --> 01:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
particular subgroup of students but
 
01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
performs poorly in another subgroup of
 
01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
students that's information that's
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
helpful for the Department to know why
 
01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
is it that on these particular test
 
01:32:47.689 --> 01:32:47.699 align:start position:0%
questions one particular subgroup of
 
01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
students is performing poorly
 
01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
it could be that there's something that
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're missing with that subgroup of
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
students from an instructional
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
perspective but it could also mean that
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
that test question itself is written in
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
a way that is biased towards a
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
particular group of students and so that
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
may not be a question that we include on
 
01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
future versions of the test so it's a
 
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
way for us to make sure that the test
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
continues to remain high quality year to
 
01:33:11.689 --> 01:33:11.699 align:start position:0%
year and it provides us good information
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
instructionally to then provide out to
 
01:33:16.370 --> 01:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
districts and teachers
 
01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
represent miler all right I want to uh
 
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
I want to address the s.a.t and the ACT
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
prior to having this become the High
 
01:33:30.649 --> 01:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
School exam
 
01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
we had received reports from actually
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
students and uh teachers that this
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
particular exam taken in the 10th grade
 
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
or the 11th grade whichever it happens
 
01:33:44.209 --> 01:33:44.219 align:start position:0%
to be was kind of a joke
 
01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
didn't take it seriously so the
 
01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:47.450 align:start position:0%
didn't take it seriously so the
reliability

01:33:47.450 --> 01:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
reliability
 
01:33:51.169 --> 01:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
of the results of that data was fairly
 
01:33:51.179 --> 01:33:52.790 align:start position:0%
of the results of that data was fairly
suspect

01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
suspect
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
this committee as well as this
 
01:33:56.570 --> 01:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
legislature made a decision to go with
 
01:33:59.090 --> 01:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
the SAT and the ACT
 
01:34:00.890 --> 01:34:00.900 align:start position:0%
for a couple reasons
 
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
one it would allow a standardized test
 
01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
that was a more serious frankly than the
 
01:34:10.970 --> 01:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
one that they were taking before
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
secondly it provide an incentive for
 
01:34:16.729 --> 01:34:16.739 align:start position:0%
students who are taking this that scored
 
01:34:18.290 --> 01:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
better than they thought they would that
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
would say well maybe I should go to
 
01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:21.830 align:start position:0%
would say well maybe I should go to
college

01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
college
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
so and the feedback that I've gotten
 
01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
from superintendents and teachers Etc
 
01:34:29.209 --> 01:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
that this is a very serious exam that
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
that they now take a much different way
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
than it was in the past that it is
 
01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.090 align:start position:0%
than it was in the past that it is
successful

01:34:35.090 --> 01:34:35.100 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
so my question to you is why would we
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
change that
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
the second the other issue is when it
 
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
says select one or more vendors
 
01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
how is that going to provide some sense
 
01:34:50.689 --> 01:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
of standardization across the exam field
 
01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
if you may
 
01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
so the question is why would you want to
 
01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
change this at this point in time other
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
than it may provide some cost to the
 
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
department so
 
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
um you may remember the original Bill
 
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
back in 2015 or whatever I want to put
 
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
that said the department shall use sat
 
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
that was the language of the department
 
01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
requested the legislature did not accept
 
01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
the word shall and put the word May in
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
there so the current law the department
 
01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
may use the college board or sat as an
 
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
assessment vendor the department still
 
01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
may do this this language right here
 
01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:21.659 align:start position:0%
doesn't enable or require the department
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
to do anything we are still enabled to
 
01:35:27.530 --> 01:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
use sat through our state Contracting
 
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
process but we so all we're doing is we
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
we shall essentially select vendors one
 
01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:34.739 align:start position:0%
of which may be the SAT the department
 
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
is actually proposing right now an
 
01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
additional five-year contract extension
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
with sat to continue to administer that
 
01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
at the 11th grade level
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
the additional vendors so we do
 
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
currently have multiple vendors through
 
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
our assessment process so right now we
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
have a third grade third grade um an
 
01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
English language learner assessment
 
01:35:57.169 --> 01:35:57.179 align:start position:0%
which is a vendor called Wida we have a
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
assessment vendor called Dynamic
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
learning Maps which is a special
 
01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
education vendor we have cambium which
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
implements New Hampshire SAS which
 
01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
previously we used Smarter Balance which
 
01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
is the three through eight assessment
 
01:36:10.610 --> 01:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
and then sat which is the assessment in
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
the 11th grade so we already have
 
01:36:14.689 --> 01:36:14.699 align:start position:0%
additional vendors so we would still use
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
the same vendor for the same measurement
 
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
so if we were assessing third grade
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
reading across the state we would have
 
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
maybe one vendor that does that so right
 
01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
now that's SAS also luckily enough we
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
have the same vendor that does the third
 
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
grade math test which is and they also
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire SAS which is cambium
 
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
but we so we would still use the same
 
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
measurement across across the state for
 
01:36:36.649 --> 01:36:36.659 align:start position:0%
the same subgroups but we would have
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
potentially different vendors and we
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
would still potentially use sat so all
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing is referring to the state
 
01:36:42.890 --> 01:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
Contracting process essentially
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
requiring the department to do an RFP go
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
to governor and Council all of the
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
process would be existing we currently
 
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
follow but we're getting rid of the
 
01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
specific reference to college board
 
01:36:53.450 --> 01:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
because the current language does not
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
actually require the department to do
 
01:36:57.169 --> 01:36:57.179 align:start position:0%
anything well it may not require it but
 
01:36:59.450 --> 01:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
it has been doing it and there was at
 
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
the time we did this is call there was a
 
01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
rumored to be a suspected vendor that
 
01:37:10.129 --> 01:37:10.139 align:start position:0%
had a particular bias that was very
 
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
troubling to this committee and so you
 
01:37:15.729 --> 01:37:15.739 align:start position:0%
can understand my suspicion
 
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
of why this is being changed because
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
frankly I notwithstanding what you're
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
saying Caitlyn about the ability but the
 
01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
history of the essay I'm specifically
 
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
looking at the SAT has been so
 
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
successful that that I I really
 
01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
questioned taking that as an alternative
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
out of it so understanding what you're
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
saying about your five-year commitment
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
Etc well and I agree but if we
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
Department wanted to change our
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
assessment right now we could because it
 
01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
says may it doesn't say Xiao it says we
 
01:37:47.209 --> 01:37:47.219 align:start position:0%
we may use that or we may use whatever
 
01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
vendor you're talking about under that
 
01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
current under the current law we
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
actually felt that by referring to the
 
01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:54.179 align:start position:0%
state Contracting process and
 
01:37:56.209 --> 01:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
specifically putting in this year so now
 
01:37:57.890 --> 01:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
now need to go to governor and Council
 
01:37:59.330 --> 01:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
that actually strengthened the process
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
and took probably more freedom away from
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
the Department to specify that we we
 
01:38:07.729 --> 01:38:07.739 align:start position:0%
must go through the Contracting process
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
but we can use whatever vendors right
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
now that we want to based on this law
 
01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
this law doesn't anytime there's a May
 
01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
it's we may do it we may not do it
 
01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:19.010 align:start position:0%
it's we may do it we may not do it
hmm

01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
represent luno thank you very much Mr
 
01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:22.850 align:start position:0%
represent luno thank you very much Mr
chair

01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:24.470 align:start position:0%
chair
um

01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
looking at this um you know this this
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph here on on page eight and and
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
obviously that follows
 
01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
where where
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
um 193 C colon six started on page seven
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
and um and it talks about on page seven
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
where School District may choose to
 
01:38:46.010 --> 01:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
participate in a locally developed
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
alternative assessment program
 
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh in place of the Statewide assessment
 
01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if maybe to uh to satisfy
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative myler's concern here that
 
01:38:59.570 --> 01:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
we expand that to be
 
01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:00.770 align:start position:0%
we expand that to be
um

01:39:00.770 --> 01:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:05.810 --> 01:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
Public Schools may use the act or sat to
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
satisfy the Statewide assessment and
 
01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
that's you know in the event that the um
 
01:39:15.169 --> 01:39:15.179 align:start position:0%
that the department chooses a different
 
01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
assessment or maybe depending upon how
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
the department is is Led chooses an
 
01:39:27.229 --> 01:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
assessment that that that really goes
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
goes maybe
 
01:39:32.169 --> 01:39:32.179 align:start position:0%
um you know against the the educational
 
01:39:35.209 --> 01:39:35.219 align:start position:0%
programming at most of our Public
 
01:39:38.090 --> 01:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
Schools so at least it would give our
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
Public Schools both chartered public
 
01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
schools and school districts the ability
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
to to continue to use the s.a.t and act
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
um would that be some and and be
 
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
consistent with what's being done right
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
now what's being taught in schools and
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
and consistent with the the ability for
 
01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:01.739 align:start position:0%
schools to select their own
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
assessment test
 
01:40:09.290 --> 01:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
so one of the that could be one
 
01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
possibility absolutely we've looked at a
 
01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
couple of different
 
01:40:14.090 --> 01:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
um you know different ways of drafting
 
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
this or language because you know as
 
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn mentioned you know we are
 
01:40:20.450 --> 01:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
getting great data from the SAT we're in
 
01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
the middle of signing on with a you know
 
01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:23.639 align:start position:0%
in the negotiations for another
 
01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
five-year contract you know so that
 
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
would put the SAT for the next five
 
01:40:28.729 --> 01:40:28.739 align:start position:0%
years as well as the assessment that
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
we're using regardless of the language
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
here in the statute uh we could add some
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
additional definitions as well around
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
the type of assessment that is there are
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
definitions for different types of
 
01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
Assessments that come directly from the
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
federal Essa law one of those is a
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized High School
 
01:40:45.890 --> 01:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
academic assessment which is an
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
assessment of high school students
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
Knowledge and Skills administered in
 
01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
multiple States and recognized by
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher education in
 
01:40:53.450 --> 01:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
those or other states for the purposes
 
01:40:55.729 --> 01:40:55.739 align:start position:0%
of entrance or placement into courses in
 
01:40:57.229 --> 01:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education or training
 
01:40:59.629 --> 01:40:59.639 align:start position:0%
programs and so the SAT would fit that
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
definition so
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
having that definition in there means
 
01:41:05.689 --> 01:41:05.699 align:start position:0%
that we want to select an assessment at
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
that level that meets this definition
 
01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
and the SAT meets that definition there
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
may be other assessments that other
 
01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
states may use it may not meet that
 
01:41:13.970 --> 01:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
definition but this comes right from the
 
01:41:15.470 --> 01:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
federal Essa law
 
01:41:16.850 --> 01:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
and so that could be another way of
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
putting it in there that no matter what
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
assessment we use it's got to meet this
 
01:41:21.649 --> 01:41:21.659 align:start position:0%
particular Federal definition which we
 
01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
know the SAT does
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald did you have
 
01:41:26.689 --> 01:41:26.699 align:start position:0%
your hand up earlier
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
I was just continuing along the same
 
01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
line of reasoning relating to the SAT or
 
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
act from what was stated it doesn't seem
 
01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
like changing the language would really
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
change the practice so I'm just
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
wondering if removing SAT and ACT from
 
01:41:44.209 --> 01:41:44.219 align:start position:0%
the statute if that's part of a larger
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
discussion to really move away from
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
these tests we've had testimony on other
 
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
bills relating to student mental health
 
01:41:51.890 --> 01:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
and knowing that these standardized
 
01:41:54.890 --> 01:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
tests in particular the SAT is a huge
 
01:41:56.930 --> 01:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
source of anxiety for students I'm
 
01:41:58.970 --> 01:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
curious of the reasoning for this is
 
01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
related to that as well
 
01:42:03.649 --> 01:42:03.659 align:start position:0%
not necessarily no so one of the reasons
 
01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
why we wanted to pull specific reference
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
to a vendor out is because a
 
01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
relationship between a state and a
 
01:42:12.649 --> 01:42:12.659 align:start position:0%
vendor does go both ways and so while we
 
01:42:14.570 --> 01:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
want to use the SAT as a Statewide
 
01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
assessment it also means that college
 
01:42:18.169 --> 01:42:18.179 align:start position:0%
board has to do specific things on their
 
01:42:20.209 --> 01:42:20.219 align:start position:0%
end for us through that contract that
 
01:42:22.129 --> 01:42:22.139 align:start position:0%
they don't have to do for students that
 
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
are just administering the SAT
 
01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's a whole data relationship right
 
01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
there as well as peer review peer review
 
01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
is a year to two year long process of
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
reviewing an assessment statistically by
 
01:42:36.169 --> 01:42:36.179 align:start position:0%
the state by their Vendor by U.S
 
01:42:37.609 --> 01:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to make sure
 
01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
that that assessment meets the federal
 
01:42:41.810 --> 01:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
requirements for a state assessment
 
01:42:44.090 --> 01:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
college board down the road could decide
 
01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
that's more work than we necessarily
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
want to do we're not going to do that
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
and if we have specific statutes that
 
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
are calling out a vendor even if we may
 
01:42:54.169 --> 01:42:54.179 align:start position:0%
want to use them if it's not if they
 
01:42:55.850 --> 01:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
decide they're not now going to meet
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
that definition it would be a difficult
 
01:42:59.450 --> 01:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
position that we would be in to try to
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
use a vendor that now doesn't meet a
 
01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
particular definition because of vendors
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
being called out in our state statute
 
01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
now we don't exp that's a hypothetical
 
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
right we don't expect that to occur we
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
have a great relationship with all of
 
01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
our vendors and again as Caitlyn said
 
01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
we're working on that contract now with
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
sat we think we get really good data
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
from the SAT it's just in our minds in
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
terms of any relationship with any
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
vendor it's always safe to not
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
specifically call out a vendor name
 
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
within the statute because you don't
 
01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
know what's going to happen five years
 
01:43:28.609 --> 01:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
now or 10 years or 15 years down the
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
road so crafting a state statute that
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
ensures a particular type of assessment
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
as opposed to calling out a specific
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
vendor name just provides the department
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit more flexibility but we're
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
not looking to change anything in terms
 
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
of our current practice with this change
 
01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden
 
01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
um I was just I agree with you I mean
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
vendor names really should not be in
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
but we have so much
 
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:54.709 align:start position:0%
but we have so much
um

01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
faith in the s.a.t
 
01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
that you could and it makes me nervous
 
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
not having any reference to that in
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
particular to the high school level and
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
I just wondered if you would consider
 
01:44:08.209 --> 01:44:08.219 align:start position:0%
that sentence on the left the department
 
01:44:11.209 --> 01:44:11.219 align:start position:0%
may you may use doesn't say shall use
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
for high school assessment and add that
 
01:44:17.689 --> 01:44:17.699 align:start position:0%
to your new section four
 
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
I think that if if the committee has
 
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
that much faith in the SAT
 
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
you should change the law to a shell but
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
it does nothing the way it is right now
 
01:44:30.109 --> 01:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
so if you if if you're saying that what
 
01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire wants to do going forward
 
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity is use sat change it till
 
01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
the department shall use sat and then we
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
don't even need to deal with all the RFP
 
01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
process and all of that that comes with
 
01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
it so I like that idea there you go
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
but yeah when we initially looked at the
 
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
ACT versus the SAT we had Consultants
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
from both organizations here testifying
 
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
and providing us information there were
 
01:44:55.850 --> 01:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
are there still students in the state
 
01:44:58.609 --> 01:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
taking the ACT there as soon as it take
 
01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
act it's just not used as a state
 
01:45:02.810 --> 01:45:02.820 align:start position:0%
assessment in the 11th grade and that's
 
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
all we're talking about right now as
 
01:45:06.109 --> 01:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the one common
 
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
metric that the state is using for
 
01:45:09.709 --> 01:45:09.719 align:start position:0%
accountability purposes for state and
 
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
federal accountability purposes and
 
01:45:13.729 --> 01:45:13.739 align:start position:0%
ensuring that that schools are providing
 
01:45:16.010 --> 01:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
adequate education what that measure is
 
01:45:18.649 --> 01:45:18.659 align:start position:0%
right now is being measured through the
 
01:45:18.659 --> 01:45:20.270 align:start position:0%
right now is being measured through the
SAT

01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
SAT
 
01:45:23.209 --> 01:45:23.219 align:start position:0%
um school kids take SATs many times we
 
01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
know that kids take PSATs take take the
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
ACT but the metric that we are using for
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
our state and federal accountability
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
purposes is the SAT
 
01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
further on this page yes represent
 
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
cordiello okay so this is regards also
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
to the SAT and I do think it's good that
 
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
you've changed it so you don't mention a
 
01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
specific vendor
 
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
what I question is the possibility of
 
01:45:48.410 --> 01:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
the College Board
 
01:45:50.209 --> 01:45:50.219 align:start position:0%
being a vendor
 
01:45:50.219 --> 01:45:52.310 align:start position:0%
being a vendor
because

01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:52.910 align:start position:0%
because
um

01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
I question the validity of the SAT as a
 
01:45:56.159 --> 01:45:57.229 align:start position:0%
I question the validity of the SAT as a
a

01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:45:59.090 --> 01:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
good indicator
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
for evaluating the public schools
 
01:46:07.149 --> 01:46:07.159 align:start position:0%
many many students take tutoring courses
 
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
because even though a lot of colleges no
 
01:46:11.689 --> 01:46:11.699 align:start position:0%
longer require the SAT it's still
 
01:46:13.729 --> 01:46:13.739 align:start position:0%
something that you know when with some
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
of these competitive schools
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
that you want to do well on
 
01:46:18.890 --> 01:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
and so there's many students who take
 
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
these courses and
 
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't that skew a little bit so
 
01:46:27.649 --> 01:46:27.659 align:start position:0%
that what if you use that as an
 
01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:29.719 align:start position:0%
assessment for the public schools
 
01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
it's kind of bringing in to the equation
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
the the use of
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
resources outside the public schools
 
01:46:39.370 --> 01:46:39.380 align:start position:0%
such as these tutoring
 
01:46:43.129 --> 01:46:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:44.689 --> 01:46:44.699 align:start position:0%
I don't think we'd be able to get away
 
01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
from tutoring I think we see tutoring
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
for many students across a lot of
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
different areas um I know I've used
 
01:46:51.890 --> 01:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
tutoring services for some of my own
 
01:46:53.450 --> 01:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
kids when they've come home with a bad
 
01:46:55.129 --> 01:46:55.139 align:start position:0%
report card in seventh grade and we
 
01:46:57.290 --> 01:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
thought we've gotta get a math tutor for
 
01:47:00.169 --> 01:47:00.179 align:start position:0%
Maddie let's get that going
 
01:47:02.689 --> 01:47:02.699 align:start position:0%
um the SAT is changing the format of
 
01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
their assessment a little bit as well I
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
think they've started to shift to doing
 
01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
this assessment for more States as an
 
01:47:09.770 --> 01:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
accountability measure the SED
 
01:47:11.810 --> 01:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
historically has been paper-based it's
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
been a single form every student has
 
01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
taken the same sat they're now moving
 
01:47:18.649 --> 01:47:18.659 align:start position:0%
more towards an assessment style that
 
01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
matches our current state assessment
 
01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
which is adaptive so now it's more based
 
01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
on the students performance on each
 
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
individual question so students go in
 
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
and take a question they may receive a
 
01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
slightly more challenging question or
 
01:47:31.729 --> 01:47:31.739 align:start position:0%
slightly easier question depending on
 
01:47:33.649 --> 01:47:33.659 align:start position:0%
how students are performing on that on
 
01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:35.820 align:start position:0%
pieces of the SAT so I do think the
 
01:47:37.370 --> 01:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
assessment itself is Shifting and
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
finding ways of really actually
 
01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
measuring student Proficiency in those
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
particular areas that's right I think
 
01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be you know some
 
01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
students that have different advantages
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
because they've accessed tutoring
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities after school opportunities
 
01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
things like that and we know there are a
 
01:47:52.609 --> 01:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
lot of opportunities geared towards sat
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
and the act because of their role in in
 
01:47:57.129 --> 01:47:57.139 align:start position:0%
college placement
 
01:47:59.930 --> 01:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
in the in the many high schools give
 
01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:00.770 align:start position:0%
in the in the many high schools give
those

01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
SAT prep type classes
 
01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:04.550 align:start position:0%
SAT prep type classes
um

01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:06.890 --> 01:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
so they're available to every kid in the
 
01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:08.030 align:start position:0%
so they're available to every kid in the
school

01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli yes just in relation
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
to the tutoring the department has a
 
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:15.719 align:start position:0%
contract currently so tutoring is
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
available through tutor.com at no cost
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
to every student and I believe that does
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
include some s.a.t related instruction
 
01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
with their tutoring service it does but
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
it also may include tutoring for a third
 
01:48:30.770 --> 01:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
grader that needs reading assistant
 
01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
exactly so right yes
 
01:48:35.090 --> 01:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
any further comments on this page
 
01:48:37.729 --> 01:48:37.739 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm going back to the section 5
 
01:48:44.270 --> 01:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
discussion and I'm wondering if you can
 
01:48:47.209 --> 01:48:47.219 align:start position:0%
be more specific about what other
 
01:48:49.129 --> 01:48:49.139 align:start position:0%
student demographic or statistical
 
01:48:51.890 --> 01:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
information is I mean you mentioned free
 
01:48:55.490 --> 01:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch but what all
 
01:48:57.290 --> 01:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
are you collecting
 
01:48:59.810 --> 01:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
so this would be the primary subgroups
 
01:49:01.250 --> 01:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
that we report out on so that would
 
01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:02.820 align:start position:0%
include things like free reduced lunch
 
01:49:05.530 --> 01:49:05.540 align:start position:0%
uh students with disabilities
 
01:49:09.050 --> 01:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
the ethnic and uh racial groups that we
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
collect information on
 
01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:15.659 align:start position:0%
um and uh puts the to another oh yeah we
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
have some smaller group of military
 
01:49:19.490 --> 01:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
connected students in foster care as
 
01:49:21.169 --> 01:49:21.179 align:start position:0%
well as English language Learners so
 
01:49:22.850 --> 01:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
those are sort of the primary groups so
 
01:49:24.590 --> 01:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
for example with that demographic
 
01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
information we'd be able to compare how
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities did on
 
01:49:30.050 --> 01:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
components of the test versus general
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
education population or how did the free
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
reduced population students do in
 
01:49:36.109 --> 01:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
comparison with say students with
 
01:49:37.490 --> 01:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
disabilities or the general education
 
01:49:39.649 --> 01:49:39.659 align:start position:0%
population it gives us another measure
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
to make sure that our test is a valid
 
01:49:43.669 --> 01:49:43.679 align:start position:0%
and reliable test for all of our
 
01:49:45.590 --> 01:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
students in the state
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
represent Myler you can correct me if
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong here isn't the SAT that we're
 
01:49:55.129 --> 01:49:55.139 align:start position:0%
currently providing for our high school
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
students it's not the same
 
01:50:01.250 --> 01:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
it doesn't cover everything that's
 
01:50:03.050 --> 01:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
available for example I appear that it
 
01:50:05.209 --> 01:50:05.219 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the writing component in it
 
01:50:08.149 --> 01:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
for example there so there are it's not
 
01:50:10.490 --> 01:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
the totality of if I was going to just
 
01:50:13.370 --> 01:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
take this by myself getting ready to go
 
01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
to school but am I correct in that it is
 
01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
the same it concludes writing it does
 
01:50:20.930 --> 01:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
include writing yes so so it is the same
 
01:50:23.209 --> 01:50:23.219 align:start position:0%
it is okay okay thank you for that
 
01:50:24.290 --> 01:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
clarification and it was something that
 
01:50:25.850 --> 01:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
we made sure to add it because I know
 
01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
that early on when we first talked about
 
01:50:29.090 --> 01:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
adopting the sat there was a discussion
 
01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
around would it just be you know the
 
01:50:32.689 --> 01:50:32.699 align:start position:0%
reading and math sections or will we
 
01:50:34.609 --> 01:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
include that writing and that is part of
 
01:50:36.590 --> 01:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
the Statewide contract that we have
 
01:50:38.330 --> 01:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
we did when we had to do that and we
 
01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
held us an important benefit for all
 
01:50:41.209 --> 01:50:41.219 align:start position:0%
students in the state to have equal
 
01:50:43.910 --> 01:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
access to the SAT and and that included
 
01:50:45.649 --> 01:50:45.659 align:start position:0%
if you know you need the writing portion
 
01:50:48.050 --> 01:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
for college entry you that didn't we
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that the kids that
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
were taking that as part of the 11th
 
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
grade assessment that was the only time
 
01:50:54.649 --> 01:50:54.659 align:start position:0%
they were taking that test
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
um they weren't being excluded from that
 
01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:57.590 align:start position:0%
um they weren't being excluded from that
so

01:50:57.590 --> 01:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you
 
01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.709 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you
chairman

01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
um as regards the other groups that you
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
just identified the subgroups
 
01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:05.750 align:start position:0%
just identified the subgroups
um

01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:09.070 --> 01:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
would that data be available to schools
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
individual schools so they could improve
 
01:51:14.330 --> 01:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
their instruction what would it be just
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh for the Statewide analysis event so
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
that data is is currently available to
 
01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
schools because schools already have the
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
demographic information and so when they
 
01:51:25.370 --> 01:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
You Know download their assessment data
 
01:51:27.050 --> 01:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
into their student Information Systems
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
they can look across their own student
 
01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
demographics because they have that this
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
would be more done at an internal state
 
01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
level not necessarily for any kind of
 
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
external reporting because we do some
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
external reporting on subgroups already
 
01:51:43.609 --> 01:51:43.619 align:start position:0%
this is really just for when internally
 
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
my staff are looking at the assessment
 
01:51:47.330 --> 01:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
and looking at that data is the
 
01:51:49.070 --> 01:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
assessment doing what the vendor is
 
01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:50.820 align:start position:0%
telling us it should be doing so it's
 
01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
really not for public reporting thank
 
01:51:55.729 --> 01:51:55.739 align:start position:0%
you thank you sir
 
01:51:55.739 --> 01:51:57.410 align:start position:0%
you thank you sir
Santana

01:51:57.410 --> 01:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
Santana
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:52:03.590 --> 01:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I guess the my question is around
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
again the shall select one or more
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
vendors through Statewide Contracting
 
01:52:08.639 --> 01:52:10.189 align:start position:0%
vendors through Statewide Contracting
process

01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
um so the selection is is basically uh
 
01:52:18.770 --> 01:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
process that the Contracting process I
 
01:52:21.530 --> 01:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
assume is with rfps and and goes through
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
the executive Council that sort of thing
 
01:52:27.050 --> 01:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
but um so when you uh propose these
 
01:52:30.050 --> 01:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
vendors who actually
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
um what what process is used to select
 
01:52:36.109 --> 01:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
them and then the fact that you say one
 
01:52:38.270 --> 01:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
or more vendors does that mean that
 
01:52:40.450 --> 01:52:40.460 align:start position:0%
schools will have a choice
 
01:52:44.209 --> 01:52:44.219 align:start position:0%
of what what they'll be able to do where
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
you have like two or let's say two or
 
01:52:49.370 --> 01:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
three vendors that um you know one
 
01:52:51.649 --> 01:52:51.659 align:start position:0%
school wants to do a classical education
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
so they're going to take that particular
 
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
vendor and another school is going to be
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
a school that really focuses on college
 
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
prep and so they want that's that vendor
 
01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:04.860 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't give schools a choice it
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
but we have to provide different types
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
of tests as part of our state assessment
 
01:53:11.930 --> 01:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
requirements so for example the SAT only
 
01:53:13.970 --> 01:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
looks at Reading Writing and Mathematics
 
01:53:15.770 --> 01:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
it does not include science in the SAT
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
so we have a second vendor cambium that
 
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
provides a science test for our Juniors
 
01:53:22.370 --> 01:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
so when 11th graders take the test they
 
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
take the SAT for the reading and the
 
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
math but then they also take a science
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
portion that's provided by our other
 
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
vendor cambium so we talk about one or
 
01:53:31.129 --> 01:53:31.139 align:start position:0%
more vendors it's to make sure that
 
01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
we're satisfying all the different
 
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
requirements and not every vendor does
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
every test the dlm is another great
 
01:53:41.209 --> 01:53:41.219 align:start position:0%
example they provide a test for students
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
that have severe cognitive disabilities
 
01:53:45.169 --> 01:53:45.179 align:start position:0%
that can't take any of the other
 
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
assessment instruments that we have and
 
01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
so those are assessments that are geared
 
01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
specifically and scaffolded in a way to
 
01:53:53.810 --> 01:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
provide instructional information for
 
01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:56.340 align:start position:0%
those students that we wouldn't be able
 
01:53:57.530 --> 01:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
to get that kind of information on the
 
01:53:59.810 --> 01:53:59.820 align:start position:0%
other assessment systems
 
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
okay let's let's move on I'd like to get
 
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
through 193 seed for lunch and then we
 
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
can do ee later
 
01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:07.370 align:start position:0%
can do ee later
um

01:54:07.370 --> 01:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
which is another couple page anything on
 
01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.050 --> 01:54:18.060 align:start position:0%
I think this page just has stuff that
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
you know the number of kids which you
 
01:54:22.129 --> 01:54:22.139 align:start position:0%
have to have 11 or more before you're
 
01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's the number of kids taking the test
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
before you get some kind of information
 
01:54:31.010 --> 01:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
and if you only have two kids three kids
 
01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
in a school
 
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
pretty easy to find out who they were
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
protecting information
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
so that's been one of my my interesting
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
things was to to try to see uh you know
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
the test results of some of the smaller
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
number of schools and uh you know when
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
one or two people take the SATs or or
 
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
something like that that's it it really
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
isn't very uh telling about what the
 
01:54:59.450 --> 01:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
school is doing so
 
01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
is there any indication that if if a
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
school because parents can opt their
 
01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
kids out
 
01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:07.550 align:start position:0%
kids out
um

01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh and they get a minimum size of less
 
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
than 11 is there anything that the state
 
01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
department does to or to try to
 
01:55:18.649 --> 01:55:18.659 align:start position:0%
encourage or help that school or come
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
and talk to the parents about why it's
 
01:55:22.609 --> 01:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
important to take the testing so that
 
01:55:26.209 --> 01:55:26.219 align:start position:0%
more students are involved that I have
 
01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
had many and my staff have had many
 
01:55:29.570 --> 01:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
conversations with superintendents and
 
01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:32.820 align:start position:0%
principals around parent opt-outs and
 
01:55:34.370 --> 01:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
providing additional information if we
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
can directly to schools or districts or
 
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
helping School Leaders with elements of
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
that communication out to their
 
01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:41.209 align:start position:0%
that communication out to their
Community

01:55:41.209 --> 01:55:41.219 align:start position:0%
Community
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
um under state law right now parents
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
can't opt out and they have that ability
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
to do so so it definitely does affect
 
01:55:50.689 --> 01:55:50.699 align:start position:0%
our data reporting it can affect it in
 
01:55:53.090 --> 01:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
many different ways but it's not
 
01:55:54.770 --> 01:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
necessarily something that schools can
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
prevent parents from doing either
 
01:55:58.430 --> 01:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
because state law currently does give
 
01:56:01.250 --> 01:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
them that right to opt out
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you I just
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
point out that uh
 
01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
um Roman 4 in current law
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
is changed up above
 
01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:15.350 align:start position:0%
is changed up above
um

01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:19.310 --> 01:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
similar to questions about the test and
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
entity and student provided data on the
 
01:56:25.250 --> 01:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
previous page that I I think we need to
 
01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
look look at closely as a committee if
 
01:56:30.890 --> 01:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to make those changes I
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
think we kind of felt that eight might
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
have been an arbitrary number and we
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to just say like weirdly what
 
01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
should that be is there a time where we
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
may need to have more flexibility around
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
that especially if there were we have
 
01:56:41.450 --> 01:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
had many conversations about a
 
01:56:43.129 --> 01:56:43.139 align:start position:0%
kindergarten assessment and things like
 
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
that but we wanted to make sure that
 
01:56:48.410 --> 01:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
there was a very clear path forward to
 
01:56:51.290 --> 01:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
having a destruction policy in place and
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
so we thought that would be better
 
01:56:55.129 --> 01:56:55.139 align:start position:0%
determined in our a contract with the
 
01:56:57.290 --> 01:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
vendors versus that right my only
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
concern is handing over to the
 
01:57:03.770 --> 01:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
department the termination of that
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind so I think the
 
01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
department would also if that were to
 
01:57:12.890 --> 01:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
stay here we need clarification around
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
what does eight years mean is it eight
 
01:57:16.669 --> 01:57:16.679 align:start position:0%
years from Individual Student Records is
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
it eight years from a particular
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
contract is it eight years based off of
 
01:57:24.290 --> 01:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
a grade that was tested because that
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
changes the records that are going to be
 
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
destroyed and so to say just eight years
 
01:57:30.109 --> 01:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
is not specific enough for us to be able
 
01:57:31.729 --> 01:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
to communicate to that vendor what is
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
eight years mean
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
so if you are to do something in
 
01:57:37.070 --> 01:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
accordance with the new language
 
01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
proposed here what would be your
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
timeline you know as determined by the
 
01:57:45.050 --> 01:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
state contract what would you try to
 
01:57:46.669 --> 01:57:46.679 align:start position:0%
negotiate to get in as far as the
 
01:57:49.010 --> 01:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
turnaround of information all right
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
destroying it I think we would look to
 
01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
see what are some exemplary examples of
 
01:57:55.550 --> 01:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
student data privacy and records
 
01:57:57.229 --> 01:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
retention destruction rules that are out
 
01:57:58.850 --> 01:57:58.860 align:start position:0%
there there may be examples already
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
within the state possibly in other
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
departments or even in other programs
 
01:58:04.609 --> 01:58:04.619 align:start position:0%
within our department but we don't have
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
something specifically proposed here I
 
01:58:07.850 --> 01:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
think we were looking for just the
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
ability to have a little bit more
 
01:58:12.050 --> 01:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
clarity if we could put together an
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
actual data retention schedule with
 
01:58:16.450 --> 01:58:16.460 align:start position:0%
requirements around Data Destruction
 
01:58:18.770 --> 01:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
than what's currently in law because
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
eight years was one possibly arbitrary
 
01:58:23.689 --> 01:58:23.699 align:start position:0%
until it's a little bit too vague to
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
have a really robust data privacy record
 
01:58:27.709 --> 01:58:27.719 align:start position:0%
destruction schedule
 
01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
okay good yes representative Tanner just
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
thank you just on a follow-up where
 
01:58:35.570 --> 01:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
you've eliminated down at the bottom of
 
01:58:37.970 --> 01:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
the page a school district shall not
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
become I assume be penalized any
 
01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
Exempted student nor shall they
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh Department of Education or State
 
01:58:48.649 --> 01:58:48.659 align:start position:0%
Board of Education penalize any school
 
01:58:51.050 --> 01:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
district for a lower lower participation
 
01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
rate you've taken that out so this is an
 
01:58:54.770 --> 01:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
area that we actually wanted to have a
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
discussion with the committee on um
 
01:58:58.189 --> 01:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
because we actually right now the way
 
01:59:00.350 --> 01:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
that the federal law works is we are
 
01:59:02.089 --> 01:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
required to essentially have a penalty
 
01:59:03.550 --> 01:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
for students that are opted out
 
01:59:05.810 --> 01:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
federally if a student opts out of the
 
01:59:07.129 --> 01:59:07.139 align:start position:0%
assessment that's required to assess
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
that score is counted as a zero so then
 
01:59:13.609 --> 01:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
that if school had a high number of
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
students that were opting out the school
 
01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
would have lower scores that were being
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
used for the purpose of accountability
 
01:59:20.990 --> 01:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's required federally we don't have
 
01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:23.099 align:start position:0%
the ability to do anything about that
 
01:59:25.010 --> 01:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
if we have a state accountability system
 
01:59:27.229 --> 01:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to talk about for the
 
01:59:28.729 --> 01:59:28.739 align:start position:0%
state accountability system that they're
 
01:59:31.129 --> 01:59:31.139 align:start position:0%
selling maybe not any penalties but we
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
don't have any flexibility around the
 
01:59:34.070 --> 01:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
federal side of things
 
01:59:36.649 --> 01:59:36.659 align:start position:0%
so we were bringing that forward as a
 
01:59:38.209 --> 01:59:38.219 align:start position:0%
discussion point because
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
technically right now we are penalizing
 
01:59:42.649 --> 01:59:42.659 align:start position:0%
those schools because of that
 
01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
so so you're saying that in the state
 
01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:47.390 align:start position:0%
so so you're saying that in the state
reporting

01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:59:51.169 --> 01:59:51.179 align:start position:0%
to the feds you can penalize they want
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
you to penalize us for non-participation
 
01:59:54.239 --> 01:59:55.310 align:start position:0%
you to penalize us for non-participation
correct

01:59:55.310 --> 01:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
so if you if you report it that way to
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
the feds that's how you're reporting it
 
02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679 align:start position:0%
to statewide right now we're not
 
02:00:03.589 --> 02:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
delineating it for a state state
 
02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
purposes we could potentially do that
 
02:00:09.410 --> 02:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
but at this point you are actually going
 
02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
against the current law and you are
 
02:00:12.649 --> 02:00:12.659 align:start position:0%
penalizing because we are acquired by
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
the federal law to do so
 
02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:15.649 align:start position:0%
the federal law to do so
great

02:00:15.649 --> 02:00:15.659 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative Cascade and then
 
02:00:19.010 --> 02:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
so does that reference
 
02:00:24.410 --> 02:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
um when you have to penalize say a
 
02:00:25.370 --> 02:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
student just for a matter of
 
02:00:27.290 --> 02:00:27.300 align:start position:0%
conversation isn't there a threshold
 
02:00:27.300 --> 02:00:28.310 align:start position:0%
conversation isn't there a threshold
that

02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:31.609 --> 02:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
in the requirement that each school has
 
02:00:34.129 --> 02:00:34.139 align:start position:0%
to have at least uh 95 percent
 
02:00:37.609 --> 02:00:37.619 align:start position:0%
participation rate correct so anybody
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
within that five percent
 
02:00:42.109 --> 02:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
is that what the feds say you have to
 
02:00:45.790 --> 02:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so no no
 
02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:47.890 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so no no
yes

02:00:47.890 --> 02:00:47.900 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:00:51.050 --> 02:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
95 threshold so
 
02:00:52.850 --> 02:00:52.860 align:start position:0%
the I mean the state law right now we
 
02:00:54.649 --> 02:00:54.659 align:start position:0%
could match it exactly with what the
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
federal law says we could I I don't
 
02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
really we didn't really know what
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
direction to go in right now because we
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
need to implement the federal law and
 
02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
the state law so and what's that
 
02:01:06.050 --> 02:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
threshold of participation the state law
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
has well this this is the state law it
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
just says the state shall not penalize
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
that anybody but because we haven't been
 
02:01:13.250 --> 02:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
traditionally running State
 
02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:15.649 align:start position:0%
traditionally running State
accountability

02:01:15.649 --> 02:01:15.659 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
um we need to talk about what we should
 
02:01:20.209 --> 02:01:20.219 align:start position:0%
be doing for State accountability so
 
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
right now we have this issue where the
 
02:01:22.970 --> 02:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
state and federal law contradict each
 
02:01:25.850 --> 02:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
other the Department's a little confused
 
02:01:28.010 --> 02:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
in which direction to go and we're kind
 
02:01:30.169 --> 02:01:30.179 align:start position:0%
of previous discussion before and we
 
02:01:33.050 --> 02:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
knew the 95 level yeah so that's why we
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
wrote it in the way it is there are some
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
schools at that time dealing with the
 
02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
instrument we were using there were
 
02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:42.850 align:start position:0%
instrument we were using there were
questions

02:01:42.850 --> 02:01:42.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:45.709 --> 02:01:45.719 align:start position:0%
I think at the time when we wrote this
 
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
in um this was prior to the
 
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
authorization of Essa which specifically
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
required school districts or the
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to count those
 
02:01:55.070 --> 02:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
scores as a zero before there was just a
 
02:01:56.689 --> 02:01:56.699 align:start position:0%
kind of a question if a school didn't
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
meet the 95 they may lose any or all of
 
02:02:02.089 --> 02:02:02.099 align:start position:0%
of federal funding so that was kind of
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
always the conversation that had been
 
02:02:03.599 --> 02:02:04.729 align:start position:0%
always the conversation that had been
had

02:02:04.729 --> 02:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
um and then when U.S department
 
02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
education reauthorized Essa that's when
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
they came in and they said all right
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
don't take your federal funding away but
 
02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:14.639 align:start position:0%
count those scores as a zero to kind of
 
02:02:16.609 --> 02:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
have that metric be the same across all
 
02:02:19.729 --> 02:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
districts or old schools rather oh yes
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
so is the federal
 
02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
um level at 95 participation yes okay
 
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
and the state did not adopt the same
 
02:02:31.490 --> 02:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
percentage no this there's no percentage
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
in the state law okay thanks
 
02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
quickly return to rep cordelia's line of
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
questioning on the destruction of
 
02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
student data I think it doesn't make
 
02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
sense to have an arbitrary
 
02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
um year on there necessarily because as
 
02:02:47.689 --> 02:02:47.699 align:start position:0%
you said kindergarten through 12
 
02:02:50.209 --> 02:02:50.219 align:start position:0%
probably but in order to work with this
 
02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
I think we all need to understand is
 
02:02:54.169 --> 02:02:54.179 align:start position:0%
there any at all rationale
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
for if the third party maintaining these
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
Student Records after graduation for any
 
02:03:02.689 --> 02:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
period of time or after disenrollment so
 
02:03:05.089 --> 02:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
sit for example is a great example that
 
02:03:08.209 --> 02:03:08.219 align:start position:0%
um right now either there's a very a
 
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons why you might want
 
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
your sat 10 years after you've taken the
 
02:03:13.970 --> 02:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
SAT for example if you're becoming a
 
02:03:15.169 --> 02:03:15.179 align:start position:0%
certified teacher and you need to take
 
02:03:17.629 --> 02:03:17.639 align:start position:0%
this the Praxis you can opt out of
 
02:03:20.570 --> 02:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
practice one is it if you've achieved a
 
02:03:22.250 --> 02:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
certain score on Sat which is a great
 
02:03:24.649 --> 02:03:24.659 align:start position:0%
benefit we're trying to actually
 
02:03:27.169 --> 02:03:27.179 align:start position:0%
um make that more well known but that if
 
02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
I wanted to be a certified teacher right
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
now I would have to go and find my SAT
 
02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
score from early 2000s and hopefully
 
02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
college board has it because I have no
 
02:03:39.470 --> 02:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
record of it but
 
02:03:42.350 --> 02:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
and if I may uh follow up
 
02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:43.010 align:start position:0%
and if I may uh follow up
um

02:03:43.010 --> 02:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
is there any current process or could
 
02:03:48.890 --> 02:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
there reasonably any any reason why the
 
02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:51.300 align:start position:0%
school districts could not maintain
 
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
those records instead of a private
 
02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
entity third party
 
02:03:57.649 --> 02:03:57.659 align:start position:0%
um well first of all um it does actually
 
02:03:59.870 --> 02:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
say in here that
 
02:04:02.209 --> 02:04:02.219 align:start position:0%
um so Statewide assessment results of a
 
02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
student's shall not be included on the
 
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
students transcripts and so typically a
 
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
school maintains student transcripts but
 
02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
not additional records on behalf of that
 
02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
so that the law actually prevents that
 
02:04:13.370 --> 02:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:04:16.370 --> 02:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
um but a lot of those they wouldn't
 
02:04:18.290 --> 02:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
necessarily be accepted directly from a
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
school district it would mean for that
 
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
example it would need to come as it's
 
02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
directly certified from the College
 
02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:24.530 align:start position:0%
directly certified from the College
Board

02:04:24.530 --> 02:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
Board
 
02:04:28.250 --> 02:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Luna thank you very
 
02:04:29.450 --> 02:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair
 
02:04:32.209 --> 02:04:32.219 align:start position:0%
um going back to the 95 how many schools
 
02:04:35.209 --> 02:04:35.219 align:start position:0%
do we have in New Hampshire that uh have
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
participation levels below that
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
um 95 percent
 
02:04:41.930 --> 02:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know
 
02:04:43.550 --> 02:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
um I'll stop my head but one of the
 
02:04:45.410 --> 02:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
things you can do with the I platform
 
02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:46.430 align:start position:0%
things you can do with the I platform
system

02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:04:48.109 --> 02:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
um Is the participation rate is an
 
02:04:51.410 --> 02:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
indicator So within the data system we
 
02:04:52.430 --> 02:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
have on our website you can select that
 
02:04:54.050 --> 02:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
as an indicator and that will show you
 
02:04:56.570 --> 02:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
the participation rate for all schools
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
and districts in the state and you can
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
rank it so you'll be able to see you
 
02:05:01.310 --> 02:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
know from lowest participation rate to
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
highest participation rate and get a
 
02:05:05.149 --> 02:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
count of those schools and and to follow
 
02:05:08.810 --> 02:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
up on that and so does the does the um
 
02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
or let me ask another way could the
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
participation rate or could a low
 
02:05:14.810 --> 02:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
participation rate
 
02:05:16.850 --> 02:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
um contribute to a school being
 
02:05:19.850 --> 02:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
identified as a as a CSI School
 
02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah so just to kind of
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
clarify the way that that's reported out
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
so we have the percentages of proficient
 
02:05:29.330 --> 02:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
that we report on on I report so a
 
02:05:31.250 --> 02:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
school might report out that they're 65
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
proficient that's just the proficiency
 
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
of the students who took the test so as
 
02:05:38.810 --> 02:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
an example of 70 of your kids took the
 
02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:39.729 align:start position:0%
an example of 70 of your kids took the
test

02:05:39.729 --> 02:05:39.739 align:start position:0%
test
 
02:05:44.450 --> 02:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
65 of the 75 percent were proficient so
 
02:05:45.890 --> 02:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
it's not proficiency of everybody
 
02:05:47.209 --> 02:05:47.219 align:start position:0%
because we don't have that data we're
 
02:05:49.970 --> 02:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
missing 30 so the zeros aren't factored
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
in that way it really is just the
 
02:05:52.970 --> 02:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
proficiency of the kids who took the
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
test but then when you go to look at the
 
02:05:57.410 --> 02:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
Essa indicators and whether schools CSI
 
02:05:59.870 --> 02:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
or TSI that's where we Factor those
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
zeros in so a school might have 65
 
02:06:05.810 --> 02:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
proficient which would not get them
 
02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
labeled as a CSI school but if they're
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
missing 30 of the students and now count
 
02:06:12.410 --> 02:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
as zeros that 65 is going to drop down
 
02:06:15.649 --> 02:06:15.659 align:start position:0%
to you know 840 30 something percent and
 
02:06:17.149 --> 02:06:17.159 align:start position:0%
now that school is being identified as
 
02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
as underperforming because they're
 
02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
missing data and that is where it's
 
02:06:24.770 --> 02:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
counted so absolutely I would Hazard to
 
02:06:26.450 --> 02:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
guess is we definitely have CSI schools
 
02:06:28.370 --> 02:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
that were impacted by participation
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
rates in one form or another
 
02:06:33.770 --> 02:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
and in those cases
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
yeah they're being identified as CSI
 
02:06:39.050 --> 02:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
schools by the formula but it may not
 
02:06:43.070 --> 02:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily indicate be in indicative of
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
of the student performance in those
 
02:06:49.250 --> 02:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
schools correct yeah
 
02:06:52.189 --> 02:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald thanks could you
 
02:06:53.810 --> 02:06:53.820 align:start position:0%
direct me to where I can find this
 
02:06:56.089 --> 02:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
contradictory federal law
 
02:06:59.209 --> 02:06:59.219 align:start position:0%
yeah so the federal federal law is that
 
02:07:01.330 --> 02:07:01.340 align:start position:0%
every student succeeds
 
02:07:04.910 --> 02:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay and it's within the uh
 
02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:05.750 align:start position:0%
okay and it's within the uh
um

02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:08.450 --> 02:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
section 1101 or 11 11 I think but I can
 
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
send you the specific reference okay
 
02:07:13.310 --> 02:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:15.410 --> 02:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
okay ready to move on
 
02:07:17.629 --> 02:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
yep okay
 
02:07:23.930 --> 02:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:24.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
because we went over the top of page 10
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
there we're asking why take that out
 
02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:31.070 align:start position:0%
there we're asking why take that out
um

02:07:31.070 --> 02:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:34.430 --> 02:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
why why are we not keeping the portion
 
02:07:35.870 --> 02:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
there on the top
 
02:07:37.729 --> 02:07:37.739 align:start position:0%
uh where it says school district and
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
shall develop a form and it takes out
 
02:07:41.930 --> 02:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
you know the alternative situation if a
 
02:07:44.149 --> 02:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
kid doesn't take the test you provide an
 
02:07:44.159 --> 02:07:46.669 align:start position:0%
kid doesn't take the test you provide an
alternative

02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:48.589 --> 02:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
sure it's the so the particular language
 
02:07:50.149 --> 02:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
in here we had some discussions with
 
02:07:52.250 --> 02:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
some superintendents in districts where
 
02:07:54.109 --> 02:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
they had high percentages of parent
 
02:07:56.209 --> 02:07:56.219 align:start position:0%
opt-out and one of the things that they
 
02:07:57.890 --> 02:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
had struggled with was the language here
 
02:07:59.689 --> 02:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
that says the alternative activity shall
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
be agreed upon by the school district
 
02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
and the parent or legal guardian and
 
02:08:06.410 --> 02:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
there have been uh struggles within the
 
02:08:08.209 --> 02:08:08.219 align:start position:0%
field for districts and parents to agree
 
02:08:09.770 --> 02:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
on what that alternative activity is
 
02:08:12.290 --> 02:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
going to be and we haven't been able to
 
02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of resolution necessarily
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
to that issue because
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
the statute just says they both have to
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
agree on it
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
um and so rather than have a requirement
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
here that the field is struggling to
 
02:08:26.689 --> 02:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
implement because it seems like there's
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
some parents when they opt out want to
 
02:08:30.530 --> 02:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
keep their kids home that day or they
 
02:08:31.609 --> 02:08:31.619 align:start position:0%
want the kids to be able to participate
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
in a study hall the school may say well
 
02:08:34.010 --> 02:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to have them do this
 
02:08:35.930 --> 02:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
activity over here while the other
 
02:08:38.089 --> 02:08:38.099 align:start position:0%
students don't have to do that it's been
 
02:08:40.729 --> 02:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
a contention within the field so just to
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
sort of remove that because it's it
 
02:08:44.990 --> 02:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
seemed to not really be happening
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
um we we pulled that language out of
 
02:08:48.290 --> 02:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
this particular statute and that was a
 
02:08:49.070 --> 02:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
conversation we'd had with
 
02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:54.890 align:start position:0%
conversation we'd had with
superintendents

02:08:54.890 --> 02:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:57.890 --> 02:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
okay any other items on that page Why
 
02:08:59.390 --> 02:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
did it change it from commissioner to
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
department on the bottom there the
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner well you can even know more
 
02:09:05.149 --> 02:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
about the legal part of that
 
02:09:07.790 --> 02:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall adopt rules yeah so I
 
02:09:09.050 --> 02:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
mean the commissioner doesn't adoptables
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's actually the State Board of
 
02:09:12.050 --> 02:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
Education I was wondering we won't even
 
02:09:13.970 --> 02:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
have the department but anybody yeah I
 
02:09:15.229 --> 02:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
guess you could put the State Board of
 
02:09:16.609 --> 02:09:16.619 align:start position:0%
Education but we were trying anytime
 
02:09:17.629 --> 02:09:17.639 align:start position:0%
where I said the commissioner
 
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
specifically do something well we know
 
02:09:20.209 --> 02:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
the commissioner doesn't have the
 
02:09:21.530 --> 02:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
capacity to do every single thing where
 
02:09:22.850 --> 02:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
it says the commissioner shall do it and
 
02:09:24.649 --> 02:09:24.659 align:start position:0%
law so we tried to make it more generic
 
02:09:26.570 --> 02:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
that you know if it says the department
 
02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
will do it I might do it Nate might do
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
it maybe the commissioner will do it but
 
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
just kind of in the State Board I think
 
02:09:34.129 --> 02:09:34.139 align:start position:0%
there's just some confusion when you say
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
something like the commissioner do it
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
and people are oftentimes looking for
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to be the actual person
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
doing it rather than the department as a
 
02:09:42.649 --> 02:09:42.659 align:start position:0%
whole um and then again with the May
 
02:09:44.450 --> 02:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
versus shell with a we don't currently
 
02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
have rules around that so
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:51.780 align:start position:0%
would it be wise put State Board in
 
02:09:51.780 --> 02:09:53.330 align:start position:0%
would it be wise put State Board in
there

02:09:53.330 --> 02:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
because there he that's the outfit that
 
02:09:58.970 --> 02:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
does it I think he recommends yeah
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
carton recommends but I think we would
 
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
have to go back and look through the
 
02:10:03.890 --> 02:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
rules but are the laws but the majority
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the time where it talks about rules
 
02:10:07.850 --> 02:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
it says the department shall recommend
 
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
the rules it doesn't say this the State
 
02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:11.950 align:start position:0%
the rules it doesn't say this the State
Board

02:10:11.950 --> 02:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
Board
 
02:10:14.450 --> 02:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
the department when we were doing some
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
legislation for the AG people across the
 
02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
street and it had the department may
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
make rules yeah it's it's definitely
 
02:10:21.599 --> 02:10:23.089 align:start position:0%
make rules yeah it's it's definitely
inconsistent

02:10:23.089 --> 02:10:23.099 align:start position:0%
inconsistent
 
02:10:26.450 --> 02:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
um throughout this whole book so
 
02:10:28.609 --> 02:10:28.619 align:start position:0%
representative dry
 
02:10:31.070 --> 02:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I'd like to continue
 
02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
this just there's a difference between
 
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
recommend rules and adopt rules I mean
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
who finally votes on the final version
 
02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
maybe that's the person that shall be
 
02:10:44.689 --> 02:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.450 --> 02:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
is involved too
 
02:10:49.490 --> 02:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
02:10:52.129 --> 02:10:52.139 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm going back to the topic of
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
the earlier part of the page about
 
02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:56.109 align:start position:0%
the earlier part of the page about
um

02:10:56.109 --> 02:10:56.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
whose parents opt them out of the
 
02:10:58.320 --> 02:10:59.629 align:start position:0%
whose parents opt them out of the
testing

02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
testing
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned some parents wanting to
 
02:11:03.709 --> 02:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
keep their children home and some
 
02:11:06.169 --> 02:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
wanting them to have study hall
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
what else happens for those students
 
02:11:10.609 --> 02:11:10.619 align:start position:0%
frankly those seem like inadequate
 
02:11:12.109 --> 02:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
options to me
 
02:11:12.119 --> 02:11:14.209 align:start position:0%
options to me
no

02:11:14.209 --> 02:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:11:16.010 --> 02:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'd be able to tell you I
 
02:11:17.450 --> 02:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
we could reach out to some schools and
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
find out maybe on a case-by-case basis
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
the types of alternative activities
 
02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:23.770 align:start position:0%
the types of alternative activities
provided

02:11:23.770 --> 02:11:23.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:26.209 --> 02:11:26.219 align:start position:0%
after having been in the school trying
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
02:11:31.129 --> 02:11:31.139 align:start position:0%
um you ran down to Personnel because at
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
some point it's every adult in the
 
02:11:35.689 --> 02:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
building helping with the testing so if
 
02:11:37.370 --> 02:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
there's a large group from different
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
grades not participate in the test
 
02:11:42.169 --> 02:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
finding something to do with them that's
 
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
educational is virtually impossible
 
02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:47.390 align:start position:0%
educational is virtually impossible
um because

02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
um because
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
even you have to have people available
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
if the teacher needs to take a break or
 
02:11:52.850 --> 02:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
go to the bathroom you have to have some
 
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
so you know it's hard it's a hard
 
02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
it's a big problem
 
02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
especially if a lot of people opt out
 
02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:06.830 --> 02:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
the next page is where we start with uh
 
02:12:12.169 --> 02:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
adequate education so perhaps is a good
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
time to take a break
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
and come back are you able to come back
 
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
we're here all day yeah you're you got
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
it all done Hey Okay so let's come back
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
and start this thing at one o'clock
 
02:12:31.810 --> 02:12:31.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
yeah well that would follow this yeah
 
02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:37.790 align:start position:0%
yeah well that would follow this yeah
yeah

02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:48.950 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:48.960 --> 03:06:17.570 align:start position:0%
 
or

03:06:17.570 --> 03:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:17.580 --> 03:06:25.450 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:06:25.450 --> 03:06:25.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:27.469 --> 03:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
was waiting for you to bring her lunch
 
03:06:31.750 --> 03:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:34.670 --> 03:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
good answer yeah
 
03:06:37.190 --> 03:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
okay let's continue here
 
03:06:41.450 --> 03:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:44.389 --> 03:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
where you see chapter 193 adequate
 
03:06:48.710 --> 03:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:50.809 --> 03:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
03:06:54.769 --> 03:06:54.779 align:start position:0%
committee for uh Caitlin and Nate on on
 
03:06:56.750 --> 03:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
this page
 
03:07:01.070 --> 03:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:03.290 --> 03:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
go ahead one thing because you're going
 
03:07:04.190 --> 03:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
to see it throughout here and I just
 
03:07:05.809 --> 03:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
want to explain what we're doing
 
03:07:05.819 --> 03:07:07.090 align:start position:0%
want to explain what we're doing
um so

03:07:07.090 --> 03:07:07.100 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:07:10.730 --> 03:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
previously this SEC this refers to the
 
03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
03:07:13.670 --> 03:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
approval so a section of the minimum of
 
03:07:15.469 --> 03:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval but
 
03:07:18.889 --> 03:07:18.899 align:start position:0%
not all of it so it's this section of
 
03:07:20.269 --> 03:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
the law is specifically talking about
 
03:07:22.250 --> 03:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
the criteria for an adequate education
 
03:07:24.050 --> 03:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
that is actually the title right now
 
03:07:26.210 --> 03:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
that's used in law but then it then it
 
03:07:28.070 --> 03:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
refers to the public school minimum
 
03:07:30.290 --> 03:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
standards approval so what we wanted to
 
03:07:30.300 --> 03:07:31.130 align:start position:0%
standards approval so what we wanted to
do

03:07:31.130 --> 03:07:31.140 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:07:33.410 --> 03:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
because it was getting this is kind of
 
03:07:35.210 --> 03:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
the terminology the number of times that
 
03:07:37.969 --> 03:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
we use the word standards and you know
 
03:07:39.590 --> 03:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
all competencies everything throughout
 
03:07:41.330 --> 03:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
this it's it's hard to figure out we
 
03:07:42.830 --> 03:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
also have minimum standards about data
 
03:07:44.330 --> 03:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
privacy security approval and those are
 
03:07:47.389 --> 03:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
minimum standards so we're not changing
 
03:07:50.030 --> 03:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
the content of the minimum the of the
 
03:07:52.490 --> 03:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
criteria for adequate education all we
 
03:07:54.050 --> 03:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
are doing is we're changing their
 
03:07:55.550 --> 03:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
reference to minimum standards for
 
03:07:57.469 --> 03:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
public school approval to the criteria
 
03:07:58.849 --> 03:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education which is
 
03:08:00.530 --> 03:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
already the title and law and using that
 
03:08:02.210 --> 03:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
throughout here
 
03:08:05.330 --> 03:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
um just to help people understand what
 
03:08:07.370 --> 03:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
the difference in those kind of terms
 
03:08:07.380 --> 03:08:08.210 align:start position:0%
the difference in those kind of terms
are

03:08:08.210 --> 03:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:08:09.830 --> 03:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
um so I just want you'll see that and
 
03:08:12.290 --> 03:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
that's really what that is there are a
 
03:08:14.269 --> 03:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
few I think that we might actually need
 
03:08:16.010 --> 03:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
to go back in and double check that we
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
might have missed so we'll have to check
 
03:08:19.490 --> 03:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
that as we go through but that's really
 
03:08:25.610 --> 03:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:29.450 --> 03:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative so like if I understand
 
03:08:31.610 --> 03:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
what you're saying they're basically
 
03:08:34.910 --> 03:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
trying to provide some consistency
 
03:08:37.610 --> 03:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
rather than having minimum standards
 
03:08:40.190 --> 03:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
here School District curriculum here yes
 
03:08:42.769 --> 03:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
it's just to have it consistent exactly
 
03:08:44.150 --> 03:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
because there's a whole section of
 
03:08:45.590 --> 03:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
public minimum standards Public School
 
03:08:47.330 --> 03:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
approvals that are in rules that is not
 
03:08:49.010 --> 03:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
what this right here is referring to and
 
03:08:54.190 --> 03:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:56.030 --> 03:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher and then
 
03:08:57.590 --> 03:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
represent Alexis
 
03:08:59.450 --> 03:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:09:03.290 --> 03:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
um so when we make that change here uh
 
03:09:06.110 --> 03:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
two criteria for an adequate education
 
03:09:07.670 --> 03:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
because of the way adequate education
 
03:09:11.750 --> 03:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
was uh suggested in the Supreme Court
 
03:09:14.389 --> 03:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
decision sometime back Clermont I
 
03:09:17.030 --> 03:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
believe it was how would changing this
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
language in this law that applies in
 
03:09:21.349 --> 03:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
adequate education specifically with
 
03:09:23.210 --> 03:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
these criteria to a public school
 
03:09:25.389 --> 03:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
education how would that impact
 
03:09:29.150 --> 03:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
non-public school education as opposed
 
03:09:31.370 --> 03:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
to could we still say that's an adequate
 
03:09:32.809 --> 03:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
education they're receiving if we do
 
03:09:32.819 --> 03:09:34.849 align:start position:0%
education they're receiving if we do
this

03:09:34.849 --> 03:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:09:38.690 --> 03:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
this section RSA 198 93 e is
 
03:09:40.969 --> 03:09:40.979 align:start position:0%
specifically to Public Schools it's not
 
03:09:44.030 --> 03:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
for non-public schools so no changes for
 
03:09:47.450 --> 03:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
non-public schools at all thank you
 
03:09:47.460 --> 03:09:49.910 align:start position:0%
non-public schools at all thank you
personally

03:09:49.910 --> 03:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
personally
 
03:09:52.250 --> 03:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
that basically uh answered what I was
 
03:09:56.750 --> 03:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:59.990 --> 03:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
are there any yes represent cascadden
 
03:10:01.849 --> 03:10:01.859 align:start position:0%
um I'm struggling a little bit with not
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
having any type of reference of to of
 
03:10:05.690 --> 03:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards for public school
 
03:10:05.700 --> 03:10:08.269 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards for public school
approval

03:10:08.269 --> 03:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
approval
 
03:10:12.170 --> 03:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
coupled with adequate education
 
03:10:14.750 --> 03:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
does one mean the same or are we
 
03:10:16.370 --> 03:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
separating them so they mean two
 
03:10:18.469 --> 03:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
different things
 
03:10:21.830 --> 03:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
so yes and no right now when we talk
 
03:10:23.150 --> 03:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
about the criteria for an adequate
 
03:10:26.870 --> 03:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
education there are 12 different bullets
 
03:10:30.170 --> 03:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
within 193 E2 a they're refer to
 
03:10:31.550 --> 03:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
specific sections of the minimum
 
03:10:34.190 --> 03:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
standards and so that's what this
 
03:10:36.170 --> 03:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
particular section is calling out
 
03:10:36.180 --> 03:10:37.670 align:start position:0%
particular section is calling out
and

03:10:37.670 --> 03:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:39.469 --> 03:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that you know we're
 
03:10:40.730 --> 03:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
clarifying when we talk about the
 
03:10:42.110 --> 03:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
03:10:44.090 --> 03:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
approval there are a lot of things that
 
03:10:46.250 --> 03:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
are in there that aren't called out
 
03:10:49.250 --> 03:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
specifically in 183 e2a and that's the
 
03:10:50.690 --> 03:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
clarification we're trying to make here
 
03:10:53.150 --> 03:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
is it's not the full minimum standards
 
03:10:54.650 --> 03:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
but it's specifically the minimum
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
standards related to the criteria for
 
03:10:58.010 --> 03:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
inadequate education
 
03:11:05.090 --> 03:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.650 --> 03:11:11.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:15.469 --> 03:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
correct yes correct yes yeah so there
 
03:11:17.150 --> 03:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
are places in the section that's that
 
03:11:19.010 --> 03:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
refer to the minimum standards as
 
03:11:22.670 --> 03:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
defined by rsa19a3 e2a and you instead
 
03:11:24.349 --> 03:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
of saying minimum standards is defined
 
03:11:26.030 --> 03:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
in there you can just say the criteria
 
03:11:27.469 --> 03:11:27.479 align:start position:0%
for adequate education it's the same
 
03:11:30.110 --> 03:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
thing as opposed to referencing a set of
 
03:11:32.150 --> 03:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
rules through a statute we can just
 
03:11:34.010 --> 03:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
reference the statute and then that
 
03:11:35.929 --> 03:11:35.939 align:start position:0%
statute references the role
 
03:11:35.939 --> 03:11:38.030 align:start position:0%
statute references the role
okay

03:11:38.030 --> 03:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:11:41.150 --> 03:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
I think too if I may this this comes
 
03:11:44.030 --> 03:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
under the section entitled adequate
 
03:11:46.070 --> 03:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
public education
 
03:11:49.269 --> 03:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
so my sense is when you refer to
 
03:11:52.910 --> 03:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
education it's automatic it's under that
 
03:11:54.950 --> 03:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
area so it's for public education right
 
03:11:54.960 --> 03:11:59.090 align:start position:0%
area so it's for public education right
correct

03:11:59.090 --> 03:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:01.070 --> 03:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
and you'll see as we go through the
 
03:12:02.809 --> 03:12:02.819 align:start position:0%
different sections of accountability for
 
03:12:05.030 --> 03:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
example we talk about ibas the input
 
03:12:06.830 --> 03:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
based accountability system
 
03:12:09.469 --> 03:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
the ibas only references those 12
 
03:12:11.510 --> 03:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
sections in the criteria for inadequate
 
03:12:13.070 --> 03:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
education which you can find in the
 
03:12:15.530 --> 03:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and so throughout the
 
03:12:17.450 --> 03:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
accountability sections here
 
03:12:18.650 --> 03:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we're not
 
03:12:20.809 --> 03:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
referring to the minimum standards in
 
03:12:22.910 --> 03:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
its entirety but just the section of the
 
03:12:25.309 --> 03:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
minimum of Standards relative to our
 
03:12:26.809 --> 03:12:26.819 align:start position:0%
state assessment or relative to our
 
03:12:28.849 --> 03:12:28.859 align:start position:0%
accountability system which it calls out
 
03:12:32.150 --> 03:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
specifically that 193 e2a section
 
03:12:34.130 --> 03:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
so from a policy perspective it doesn't
 
03:12:36.170 --> 03:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
change anything it just changes the
 
03:12:37.849 --> 03:12:37.859 align:start position:0%
title of what we're referencing to make
 
03:12:42.889 --> 03:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:44.809 --> 03:12:44.819 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner
 
03:12:48.530 --> 03:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you what you just said made me
 
03:12:51.710 --> 03:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
think that
 
03:12:55.550 --> 03:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
um it could mean that if if we're only
 
03:12:58.849 --> 03:12:58.859 align:start position:0%
testing math English
 
03:13:01.090 --> 03:13:01.100 align:start position:0%
um history science
 
03:13:05.570 --> 03:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh that that then becomes the only
 
03:13:07.429 --> 03:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
criteria for an adequate education
 
03:13:10.670 --> 03:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
rather than the minimum standards so so
 
03:13:13.010 --> 03:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
the criteria is still listed here in law
 
03:13:15.290 --> 03:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
all we changed is the name but if you go
 
03:13:18.349 --> 03:13:18.359 align:start position:0%
to page starting on through the
 
03:13:18.359 --> 03:13:19.969 align:start position:0%
to page starting on through the
definitions

03:13:19.969 --> 03:13:19.979 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
03:13:22.910 --> 03:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
see but if you start on page 17 that's
 
03:13:25.670 --> 03:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
where it defines what the criteria is
 
03:13:27.170 --> 03:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
so right now it's a substantive
 
03:13:28.790 --> 03:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
educational content for an adequate
 
03:13:30.710 --> 03:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
education and current law we changed the
 
03:13:33.950 --> 03:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
term the specific Criterion actually we
 
03:13:35.269 --> 03:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
left the word Madam Sanders in here this
 
03:13:36.650 --> 03:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
is an area we should have fixed well
 
03:13:38.330 --> 03:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
that that actually should be because
 
03:13:41.210 --> 03:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
this is where it makes the connection to
 
03:13:44.570 --> 03:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
minimum standards so here it says this
 
03:13:46.190 --> 03:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
is the criteria for an adequate
 
03:13:48.889 --> 03:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
education it is the minimum standards in
 
03:13:51.170 --> 03:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
these areas
 
03:13:52.910 --> 03:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the clarification is
 
03:13:54.889 --> 03:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards and Rule is a very
 
03:13:57.230 --> 03:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
extensive document but the criteria for
 
03:13:59.269 --> 03:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
inadequate education is called out in
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
statute as these particular sections of
 
03:14:04.370 --> 03:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards and that's what we
 
03:14:05.450 --> 03:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're being clear
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
about is there are times where we're
 
03:14:09.230 --> 03:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
talking about all of the minimum
 
03:14:10.730 --> 03:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
standards and there are times where
 
03:14:11.929 --> 03:14:11.939 align:start position:0%
we're talking about just the minimum
 
03:14:13.550 --> 03:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
standards called out in this particular
 
03:14:13.560 --> 03:14:15.830 align:start position:0%
standards called out in this particular
statute

03:14:15.830 --> 03:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:14:17.570 --> 03:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
so we're just essentially what we're
 
03:14:19.790 --> 03:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
doing is we're trying to use a title to
 
03:14:21.710 --> 03:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
refer to a specific so people are not
 
03:14:23.809 --> 03:14:23.819 align:start position:0%
confused about all of them across the
 
03:14:23.819 --> 03:14:25.730 align:start position:0%
confused about all of them across the
board

03:14:25.730 --> 03:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:14:28.670 --> 03:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
so you're not redefining or trying to
 
03:14:31.250 --> 03:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
Define adequacy no the definition that's
 
03:14:33.110 --> 03:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
in current law is still here in this
 
03:14:40.130 --> 03:14:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:40.140 --> 03:14:41.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:14:41.630 --> 03:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:14:45.170 --> 03:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
I'm just not quite all there myself yet
 
03:14:45.180 --> 03:14:45.889 align:start position:0%
I'm just not quite all there myself yet
um

03:14:45.889 --> 03:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:49.849 --> 03:14:49.859 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at 193 e colon 2 Dash a
 
03:14:52.370 --> 03:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
which is the delivery or the substant
 
03:14:54.230 --> 03:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
educational content of an adequate
 
03:14:54.240 --> 03:14:55.849 align:start position:0%
educational content of an adequate
education

03:14:55.849 --> 03:14:55.859 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:14:59.330 --> 03:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
and there it says under Roman 4 the
 
03:15:00.710 --> 03:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
03:15:02.690 --> 03:15:02.700 align:start position:0%
approved for the areas identified in
 
03:15:06.889 --> 03:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
paragraph one and those are those
 
03:15:11.050 --> 03:15:11.060 align:start position:0%
11 areas that we have under adequacy
 
03:15:14.090 --> 03:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
shall constitute the opportunity for the
 
03:15:17.809 --> 03:15:17.819 align:start position:0%
delivery of an adequate education
 
03:15:20.210 --> 03:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
so you're not in conflict with that
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
statement No that statement is still
 
03:15:26.809 --> 03:15:26.819 align:start position:0%
on starting yeah see I you know I'm just
 
03:15:29.450 --> 03:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
looking at the law book here in yes yeah
 
03:15:32.030 --> 03:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's not in Conflict there it's
 
03:15:34.370 --> 03:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
referring to that specific list of
 
03:15:37.370 --> 03:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
criteria so that that list changed we've
 
03:15:39.950 --> 03:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
not done anything to the definition of
 
03:15:41.750 --> 03:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
that criteria and it does call it
 
03:15:43.309 --> 03:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
specifically it's the minimum standards
 
03:15:46.490 --> 03:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
in these areas of this paragraph and
 
03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
that we have this bill does not propose
 
03:15:50.030 --> 03:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
to change in any way the definition of
 
03:15:53.330 --> 03:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:55.490 --> 03:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
so when we look at minimum the words
 
03:15:57.950 --> 03:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
minimum standards
 
03:16:01.250 --> 03:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
are those referencing the minimum status
 
03:16:04.370 --> 03:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
for public school approval
 
03:16:07.969 --> 03:16:07.979 align:start position:0%
yes not the academic standards correct
 
03:16:14.290 --> 03:16:14.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
I got it but you know I mean it took us
 
03:16:19.490 --> 03:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
a long time to figure this out right so
 
03:16:20.990 --> 03:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
this summer we were working with person
 
03:16:22.910 --> 03:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
and carry on to kind of see what we were
 
03:16:23.990 --> 03:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing and we had our
 
03:16:25.790 --> 03:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
white boards and we're drawing out maps
 
03:16:29.450 --> 03:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
and it was it was it was tricky so I bet
 
03:16:34.849 --> 03:16:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:37.010 --> 03:16:37.020 align:start position:0%
yeah we're only on page 11. I jumped
 
03:16:37.020 --> 03:16:37.990 align:start position:0%
yeah we're only on page 11. I jumped
this

03:16:37.990 --> 03:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:16:41.110 --> 03:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
I jumped I know it
 
03:16:44.510 --> 03:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay so are there any more questions
 
03:16:49.490 --> 03:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:52.969 --> 03:16:52.979 align:start position:0%
that's where we started okay going on
 
03:17:00.849 --> 03:17:00.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
again on page 12 in the bottom where it
 
03:17:05.450 --> 03:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
says academic standards
 
03:17:08.030 --> 03:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see be able to do in a
 
03:17:08.040 --> 03:17:09.590 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see be able to do in a
course

03:17:09.590 --> 03:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
course
 
03:17:12.370 --> 03:17:12.380 align:start position:0%
we we can mirror the standard
 
03:17:14.769 --> 03:17:14.779 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
03:17:17.090 --> 03:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
we'll mirror the definition that we used
 
03:17:18.830 --> 03:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
from this morning
 
03:17:20.510 --> 03:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
for that one so I'll make a note that
 
03:17:23.210 --> 03:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
we're going to update that
 
03:17:26.570 --> 03:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
on the bottom page uh 12 their mail yeah
 
03:17:29.690 --> 03:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
yeah my sense is is that
 
03:17:32.269 --> 03:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
when you eliminate
 
03:17:34.190 --> 03:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
in a course
 
03:17:35.809 --> 03:17:35.819 align:start position:0%
you're basically talking about a
 
03:17:39.889 --> 03:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
competency rather than just an academic
 
03:17:39.899 --> 03:17:41.510 align:start position:0%
competency rather than just an academic
learning

03:17:41.510 --> 03:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
learning
 
03:17:43.849 --> 03:17:43.859 align:start position:0%
so is that is am I interpreting that
 
03:17:45.590 --> 03:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
right standards tend to be at a little
 
03:17:47.570 --> 03:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
bit more of a granular level so
 
03:17:49.969 --> 03:17:49.979 align:start position:0%
competencies sometimes can represent a
 
03:17:51.769 --> 03:17:51.779 align:start position:0%
single standard sometimes competencies
 
03:17:53.630 --> 03:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
can be a collection of Standards so you
 
03:17:54.950 --> 03:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
have three or four or five different
 
03:17:57.290 --> 03:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
standards to roll up into a competency
 
03:17:59.450 --> 03:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
it depends on the course it's being
 
03:17:59.460 --> 03:18:01.969 align:start position:0%
it depends on the course it's being
taught

03:18:01.969 --> 03:18:01.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:05.330 --> 03:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
so if we go on the page of 13
 
03:18:07.070 --> 03:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's where we have the definition of
 
03:18:08.750 --> 03:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
competencies and we're talking about of
 
03:18:11.590 --> 03:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
course a program of competencies
 
03:18:14.570 --> 03:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
required for graduation we we didn't
 
03:18:16.250 --> 03:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
mean to delete the definition of
 
03:18:17.990 --> 03:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
Competency okay yeah we would like to
 
03:18:20.330 --> 03:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
put that back in so that goes over on
 
03:18:21.650 --> 03:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
the right hand side no when we were
 
03:18:23.150 --> 03:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
going through this document
 
03:18:24.710 --> 03:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
um when Jen first sent us like why did
 
03:18:26.570 --> 03:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
we do this Nate and we just we
 
03:18:30.370 --> 03:18:30.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:31.990 --> 03:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
03:18:34.670 --> 03:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
we would like that added back in we like
 
03:18:36.050 --> 03:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
to say a cat walked over the keyboard
 
03:18:41.150 --> 03:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:42.889 --> 03:18:42.899 align:start position:0%
how many times they walk over the
 
03:18:42.899 --> 03:18:44.230 align:start position:0%
how many times they walk over the
keyboard

03:18:44.230 --> 03:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
keyboard
 
03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
I think I think John found everyone so
 
03:18:52.190 --> 03:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
okay so we got competencies back in that
 
03:18:54.410 --> 03:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
was a real question okay
 
03:18:54.420 --> 03:18:57.230 align:start position:0%
was a real question okay
um

03:18:57.230 --> 03:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:01.190 --> 03:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
anything else on that page page 13.
 
03:19:01.200 --> 03:19:03.410 align:start position:0%
anything else on that page page 13.
yeah

03:19:03.410 --> 03:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:19:08.150 --> 03:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
the number from 69 to 67 in the two
 
03:19:10.790 --> 03:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
years was how was that changed why was
 
03:19:13.250 --> 03:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
that change so the number 69 was used
 
03:19:16.190 --> 03:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
when and then two years was used by this
 
03:19:17.870 --> 03:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
group when we put together the law and
 
03:19:19.550 --> 03:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
we changed it you know I don't remember
 
03:19:22.130 --> 03:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
the reasoning behind that other than I
 
03:19:25.130 --> 03:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
think maybe 67 felt low but there's not
 
03:19:28.610 --> 03:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
a difference between 67 and 69 percent
 
03:19:30.650 --> 03:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
um so we really wanted to go in and just
 
03:19:33.650 --> 03:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
mirror the federal law which requires 67
 
03:19:36.410 --> 03:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
percent yes thank you another Gene
 
03:19:37.730 --> 03:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
digits you want to specify since we're
 
03:19:39.110 --> 03:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
proposing changes
 
03:19:40.910 --> 03:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
um is the superintendents requested that
 
03:19:43.550 --> 03:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
we specify that it's the four-year
 
03:19:45.710 --> 03:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
cohort because there is always confusion
 
03:19:47.389 --> 03:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
around the four year or the five-year
 
03:19:49.130 --> 03:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
cohort and that's what we do and that's
 
03:19:51.290 --> 03:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
the current practice but we do agree
 
03:19:54.110 --> 03:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
that the clarity could be used there we
 
03:19:55.670 --> 03:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
also want to add a definition to the
 
03:19:58.130 --> 03:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
word graduation rate because people are
 
03:20:00.230 --> 03:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
confused about that so thank you I think
 
03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
it was true
 
03:20:04.070 --> 03:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
if you were to Google like I did at noon
 
03:20:07.070 --> 03:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
time today the graduation rate in the
 
03:20:09.349 --> 03:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
country which is much higher than 60
 
03:20:12.650 --> 03:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
something percent it's close to 84 or 85
 
03:20:12.660 --> 03:20:13.610 align:start position:0%
something percent it's close to 84 or 85
percent

03:20:13.610 --> 03:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:20:15.889 --> 03:20:15.899 align:start position:0%
and then when I looked at the title not
 
03:20:18.170 --> 03:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
Title 20 Main
 
03:20:20.650 --> 03:20:20.660 align:start position:0%
they have written into their law for
 
03:20:23.809 --> 03:20:23.819 align:start position:0%
2015-16 the graduation rate will be 90
 
03:20:23.819 --> 03:20:24.889 align:start position:0%
2015-16 the graduation rate will be 90
percent

03:20:24.889 --> 03:20:24.899 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:20:28.250 --> 03:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
why are we putting the bar so low
 
03:20:30.590 --> 03:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a difference between what
 
03:20:31.610 --> 03:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
we're measuring at the school level
 
03:20:33.769 --> 03:20:33.779 align:start position:0%
versus the state level so sometimes some
 
03:20:34.910 --> 03:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
of those plans are looking at it from a
 
03:20:36.590 --> 03:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
state perspective so New Hampshire tends
 
03:20:38.269 --> 03:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
to have a graduation rate Statewide of
 
03:20:41.210 --> 03:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
between 90 and 95 percent sometimes it's
 
03:20:42.590 --> 03:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
been higher than that we have a really
 
03:20:44.870 --> 03:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
high graduation rate in the state this
 
03:20:46.910 --> 03:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
is really just to identify the bottom
 
03:20:49.730 --> 03:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
five percent and that's why that bar is
 
03:20:52.070 --> 03:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
is set fairly low there is we don't
 
03:20:53.690 --> 03:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
expect most high schools in the state to
 
03:20:56.450 --> 03:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
be below that number in fact if if truly
 
03:20:57.950 --> 03:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
we're only identifying five percent of
 
03:21:00.050 --> 03:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
our schools it should be a relatively
 
03:21:01.610 --> 03:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
small number of schools that are falling
 
03:21:07.969 --> 03:21:07.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:09.830 --> 03:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
so that's just representing the
 
03:21:12.050 --> 03:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
comprehensive support
 
03:21:14.690 --> 03:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
and Improvement school yes those are the
 
03:21:16.370 --> 03:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
CSI schools so it's not a it's not a
 
03:21:17.870 --> 03:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
Target or Benchmark for us as a state
 
03:21:19.790 --> 03:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's just identifying what are the
 
03:21:21.710 --> 03:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
lowest performing schools that have
 
03:21:23.570 --> 03:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
graduation rates
 
03:21:26.389 --> 03:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
so essentially for RCS high schools we
 
03:21:28.010 --> 03:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
look at all of the bottom five percent
 
03:21:29.570 --> 03:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
how they're doing but then we
 
03:21:31.490 --> 03:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
automatically identify anybody with a
 
03:21:34.910 --> 03:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
graduation rate of lower than 67 correct
 
03:21:36.889 --> 03:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
um and so regardless of them being in
 
03:21:38.929 --> 03:21:38.939 align:start position:0%
the bottom five percent or not so that's
 
03:21:40.370 --> 03:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
a requirement right now with the federal
 
03:21:41.929 --> 03:21:41.939 align:start position:0%
law and that's what we would like to
 
03:21:45.190 --> 03:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:47.210 --> 03:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
representative Luna
 
03:21:49.309 --> 03:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
thanks very much Mr chair
 
03:21:51.290 --> 03:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
um how's that going to apply how's this
 
03:21:52.790 --> 03:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
graduation rate going to apply to
 
03:21:56.990 --> 03:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
schools like vlax or um or maybe schools
 
03:21:59.210 --> 03:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
that have a a high number of students or
 
03:22:01.130 --> 03:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
high percentage of students who term out
 
03:22:03.170 --> 03:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
when they turn 22.
 
03:22:06.050 --> 03:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
so we we see that uh often with some of
 
03:22:07.309 --> 03:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
our chartered public schools in the
 
03:22:08.990 --> 03:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
state that have programs specifically
 
03:22:11.330 --> 03:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
serving students that may have either
 
03:22:13.130 --> 03:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
involved in credit recovery programs
 
03:22:15.050 --> 03:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
they may be fifth year seniors that are
 
03:22:16.610 --> 03:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
still looking to graduate but they've
 
03:22:18.349 --> 03:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
already passed that point maybe they
 
03:22:20.030 --> 03:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
were unsuccessful in previous programs
 
03:22:22.370 --> 03:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
so it does disproportionately affect
 
03:22:24.530 --> 03:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
schools that have programs focused on
 
03:22:26.750 --> 03:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
that population of students but the good
 
03:22:29.389 --> 03:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
news is that being identified as a CSI
 
03:22:30.889 --> 03:22:30.899 align:start position:0%
school also comes with that additional
 
03:22:33.410 --> 03:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
Federal monies and so if you have a
 
03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
school that has a larger proportion of
 
03:22:36.710 --> 03:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
students that are working towards
 
03:22:38.690 --> 03:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
graduation beyond their senior year
 
03:22:40.849 --> 03:22:40.859 align:start position:0%
you're going to now receive those extra
 
03:22:42.530 --> 03:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
funds to be able to support that
 
03:22:44.990 --> 03:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
particular group of students so in some
 
03:22:47.570 --> 03:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
ways it's a messaging aspect if you're a
 
03:22:49.010 --> 03:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
school that is doing good work you're
 
03:22:50.570 --> 03:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
graduating kids in their sixth year of
 
03:22:52.130 --> 03:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
high school you're going to have a low
 
03:22:54.110 --> 03:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
four-year graduation rate but you're
 
03:22:55.610 --> 03:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
still graduating those kids they just
 
03:22:57.410 --> 03:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
might be taking five or six years to do
 
03:22:57.420 --> 03:22:59.950 align:start position:0%
might be taking five or six years to do
it

03:22:59.950 --> 03:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:04.070 --> 03:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:05.990 --> 03:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
so this would only apply to full-time
 
03:23:08.030 --> 03:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
enrolled be like students so when we
 
03:23:09.710 --> 03:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
look at this particular data we filter
 
03:23:11.630 --> 03:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
out any students that are in their
 
03:23:13.190 --> 03:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
traditional like local public school
 
03:23:15.550 --> 03:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
that happen to be taking vlx courses
 
03:23:18.410 --> 03:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
yeah what's the consideration number for
 
03:23:20.090 --> 03:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
of course they have to have be full-time
 
03:23:22.130 --> 03:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
and vlogs
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's a particular
 
03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
course number for velax but it has to be
 
03:23:27.349 --> 03:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
the school of record for that student
 
03:23:29.210 --> 03:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
where vlx is the primary responsible
 
03:23:31.490 --> 03:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
school they're enrolled as a a full-time
 
03:23:33.349 --> 03:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
student and so be like in that case
 
03:23:34.670 --> 03:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
would be receiving the majority of the
 
03:23:38.210 --> 03:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:39.889 --> 03:23:39.899 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner and then represent
 
03:23:42.290 --> 03:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
Meyer and then thank you
 
03:23:43.729 --> 03:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
um I noticed you took out the two
 
03:23:46.490 --> 03:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
consecutive year part of it and it seems
 
03:23:48.889 --> 03:23:48.899 align:start position:0%
like for example with covid that you
 
03:23:50.150 --> 03:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
might have
 
03:23:53.570 --> 03:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
years when you get a bump that might put
 
03:23:55.190 --> 03:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
you below there and then you then you
 
03:23:57.050 --> 03:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
come above it and it averages out is
 
03:23:58.550 --> 03:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
there any reason
 
03:24:01.130 --> 03:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
uh to take that out so our federal
 
03:24:04.010 --> 03:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
requirements are 67 in the year that we
 
03:24:06.290 --> 03:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
identify and then the state statute was
 
03:24:08.389 --> 03:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
69 for two consecutive years so
 
03:24:10.010 --> 03:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
essentially it was two different systems
 
03:24:12.170 --> 03:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
of trying to identify the schools so we
 
03:24:13.790 --> 03:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
just made it match our federal
 
03:24:15.410 --> 03:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
requirements which didn't have that
 
03:24:17.389 --> 03:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
consecutive year requirement
 
03:24:19.130 --> 03:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't anything beyond just
 
03:24:20.510 --> 03:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
aligning it with our federal
 
03:24:22.910 --> 03:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
requirements do you see any advantage
 
03:24:25.190 --> 03:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
keeping the two-year consecutive
 
03:24:28.130 --> 03:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
for graduation rates not necessarily I
 
03:24:30.830 --> 03:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
think the the pandemic obviously was a a
 
03:24:33.110 --> 03:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
unique situation that we found ourselves
 
03:24:33.120 --> 03:24:34.250 align:start position:0%
unique situation that we found ourselves
in

03:24:34.250 --> 03:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:24:36.530 --> 03:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
um we are looking at you know some of
 
03:24:38.210 --> 03:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
our other indicators and whether there
 
03:24:40.190 --> 03:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
might be value instead of looking at a
 
03:24:41.750 --> 03:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
particular year but looking historically
 
03:24:43.309 --> 03:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
at you know school's performance over
 
03:24:45.130 --> 03:24:45.140 align:start position:0%
two years or the last three years
 
03:24:47.510 --> 03:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
because we do see especially with things
 
03:24:49.670 --> 03:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
like the pandemic there are impacts that
 
03:24:51.590 --> 03:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
might affect a school in one year or in
 
03:24:53.630 --> 03:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
two years but looking at you know a
 
03:24:54.830 --> 03:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
school's performance over time might
 
03:24:56.450 --> 03:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
give you a better picture of that so
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's something we're considering we
 
03:24:59.889 --> 03:24:59.899 align:start position:0%
could make changes to our our state plan
 
03:25:02.090 --> 03:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
and we've proposed some of those
 
03:25:05.210 --> 03:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
historical changes in our next draft of
 
03:25:06.830 --> 03:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
the state plan with the US Department of
 
03:25:06.840 --> 03:25:10.190 align:start position:0%
the state plan with the US Department of
Education

03:25:10.190 --> 03:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:11.809 --> 03:25:11.819 align:start position:0%
um we were going
 
03:25:22.370 --> 03:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:25.490 --> 03:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh so we don't necessarily have a well
 
03:25:27.590 --> 03:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
we do have we have different levels so I
 
03:25:28.610 --> 03:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
would have to take a look at the state
 
03:25:30.290 --> 03:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
plan to see you know level one two three
 
03:25:33.170 --> 03:25:33.180 align:start position:0%
or four of the percentage Yeah
 
03:25:35.389 --> 03:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
yeah um I
 
03:25:37.670 --> 03:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have any schools really that
 
03:25:40.610 --> 03:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
fall most of our schools tend to to have
 
03:25:42.410 --> 03:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
higher graduation rates we have more of
 
03:25:44.450 --> 03:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
a bubble in the state and this really is
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
just looking at capturing what is the
 
03:25:49.190 --> 03:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
lowest graduation rates in the state
 
03:25:50.929 --> 03:25:50.939 align:start position:0%
Professor McDonald and representative
 
03:25:50.939 --> 03:25:52.729 align:start position:0%
Professor McDonald and representative
Myler

03:25:52.729 --> 03:25:52.739 align:start position:0%
Myler
 
03:25:55.969 --> 03:25:55.979 align:start position:0%
would there be schools in between the 67
 
03:25:58.010 --> 03:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
and 69 percent that with this change
 
03:25:59.929 --> 03:25:59.939 align:start position:0%
would no longer be included and would
 
03:26:02.389 --> 03:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
lose funding as a result of the change
 
03:26:04.670 --> 03:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
no because up to this point we've only
 
03:26:06.290 --> 03:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
been identifying schools based off of
 
03:26:08.090 --> 03:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
that Federal requirement so this is just
 
03:26:09.410 --> 03:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
bringing this in line with what we've
 
03:26:11.090 --> 03:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
been doing over the last few years and
 
03:26:12.530 --> 03:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
we haven't been identifying schools
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
based off of the two years thank you
 
03:26:17.330 --> 03:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
representative what uh how many more
 
03:26:19.670 --> 03:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
schools will be in involved if you move
 
03:26:23.570 --> 03:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
from 69 to 67 what's the impact in the
 
03:26:25.070 --> 03:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
number of schools that it's gonna now
 
03:26:27.229 --> 03:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
that's our the 67 is actually our
 
03:26:29.389 --> 03:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
current practice because that's that was
 
03:26:30.830 --> 03:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
the Federal requirement so we've been
 
03:26:34.729 --> 03:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
using that 67 number already okay we
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
have not been using 69 so we could take
 
03:26:38.150 --> 03:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
a look to see what the difference might
 
03:26:38.160 --> 03:26:39.830 align:start position:0%
a look to see what the difference might
be

03:26:39.830 --> 03:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:26:42.410 --> 03:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:26:44.510 --> 03:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
um level so to in terms of proficiency
 
03:26:46.070 --> 03:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
language level three for graduation
 
03:26:48.530 --> 03:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
rates is a 90 so if you're graduating
 
03:26:50.090 --> 03:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
ninety percent
 
03:26:53.030 --> 03:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
um to 93 that's a level three if you
 
03:26:54.650 --> 03:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
have a graduation rate higher than 94
 
03:26:57.290 --> 03:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
that's a level four so above proficient
 
03:26:58.670 --> 03:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of graduate right proficiency
 
03:27:00.590 --> 03:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
normal is academic achievement but in
 
03:27:02.510 --> 03:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
terms of graduation rates
 
03:27:05.690 --> 03:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
um level two would be 70 to 89 and then
 
03:27:07.790 --> 03:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
below 70 we've identified as level one
 
03:27:10.429 --> 03:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
but again if you're below the 67 it's an
 
03:27:12.889 --> 03:27:12.899 align:start position:0%
automatic CSI identification so it's
 
03:27:16.670 --> 03:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:18.889 --> 03:27:18.899 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
03:27:21.530 --> 03:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you so the
 
03:27:24.769 --> 03:27:24.779 align:start position:0%
draft language doesn't include the
 
03:27:27.050 --> 03:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
statement about subsequent
 
03:27:28.610 --> 03:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
determinations being made every three
 
03:27:28.620 --> 03:27:29.809 align:start position:0%
determinations being made every three
years

03:27:29.809 --> 03:27:29.819 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:27:33.229 --> 03:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
so what is the time frame for evaluating
 
03:27:33.239 --> 03:27:34.790 align:start position:0%
so what is the time frame for evaluating
schools

03:27:34.790 --> 03:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:27:36.769 --> 03:27:36.779 align:start position:0%
so I believe it's later on in the
 
03:27:36.779 --> 03:27:37.670 align:start position:0%
so I believe it's later on in the
statute

03:27:37.670 --> 03:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:27:39.830 --> 03:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
um and it's a three-year cycle and we do
 
03:27:41.269 --> 03:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
that it's the same it's just not the
 
03:27:43.150 --> 03:27:43.160 align:start position:0%
same here correct yep thank you
 
03:27:45.769 --> 03:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you sure a
 
03:27:47.570 --> 03:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
question on your native follow-ups just
 
03:27:50.530 --> 03:27:50.540 align:start position:0%
a minute ago if level one is below 70
 
03:27:54.410 --> 03:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
and you're changing this to be 67 why
 
03:27:59.469 --> 03:27:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:02.330 --> 03:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
so we would still have some schools that
 
03:28:05.150 --> 03:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
are so that's based on the level so we
 
03:28:06.710 --> 03:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
would we would still have some schools
 
03:28:08.630 --> 03:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
that potentially could be identified as
 
03:28:10.490 --> 03:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
a CSI school because they are fall
 
03:28:12.530 --> 03:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
within the bottom five percent so if
 
03:28:13.969 --> 03:28:13.979 align:start position:0%
you're a level one and you have a bottom
 
03:28:15.710 --> 03:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
five percent you might be identified for
 
03:28:17.809 --> 03:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
that this is just based on an automatic
 
03:28:19.309 --> 03:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
determination so it says it doesn't
 
03:28:20.450 --> 03:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
matter if you need a bottom five percent
 
03:28:23.570 --> 03:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
if you're the top 10 in the school in
 
03:28:24.830 --> 03:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
the state but somehow you have a
 
03:28:27.710 --> 03:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
graduation rate of lower than 67 you're
 
03:28:29.570 --> 03:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
going to be automatically designated as
 
03:28:31.010 --> 03:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
a CSI School
 
03:28:33.050 --> 03:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:28:35.990 --> 03:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:38.330 --> 03:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
okay ready to move on
 
03:28:42.229 --> 03:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:05.630 --> 03:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:07.070 --> 03:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
where'd you get the definition for
 
03:29:07.080 --> 03:29:09.070 align:start position:0%
where'd you get the definition for
growth

03:29:09.070 --> 03:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
growth
 
03:29:11.330 --> 03:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
that comes right from our state Essa
 
03:29:13.550 --> 03:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
plan okay
 
03:29:15.229 --> 03:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
growth was used in the section multiple
 
03:29:16.910 --> 03:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
times but not defined as a lot of times
 
03:29:18.769 --> 03:29:18.779 align:start position:0%
people ask us what growth means so we
 
03:29:19.910 --> 03:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
thought it would be helpful to have a
 
03:29:19.920 --> 03:29:27.950 align:start position:0%
thought it would be helpful to have a

03:29:27.950 --> 03:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:30.349 --> 03:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
so can you explain a bit about the
 
03:29:34.790 --> 03:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
student growth percentiles sure so I
 
03:29:36.830 --> 03:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
can't give you the math equation it's a
 
03:29:39.710 --> 03:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
little bit above my head but from a kind
 
03:29:42.290 --> 03:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
of a conceptual basis what we do is we
 
03:29:44.330 --> 03:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
take a group of students that performed
 
03:29:47.450 --> 03:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
all the same level so for example fifth
 
03:29:49.849 --> 03:29:49.859 align:start position:0%
graders that all scored and I'll make up
 
03:29:50.990 --> 03:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
a number here let's say they all scored
 
03:29:53.570 --> 03:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
a 240 on the reading test so in their
 
03:29:54.590 --> 03:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
fifth grade year they were all at
 
03:29:57.050 --> 03:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
exactly the same level we take just that
 
03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
group of students and we look to see
 
03:30:00.290 --> 03:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
what was their performance on reading in
 
03:30:02.450 --> 03:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
sixth grade how did those students grow
 
03:30:04.610 --> 03:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
compared to each other so we talk about
 
03:30:06.170 --> 03:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
student growth percentile it's the
 
03:30:07.910 --> 03:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
students that are in the percentiles
 
03:30:10.309 --> 03:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
compared with each other based off of
 
03:30:12.650 --> 03:30:12.660 align:start position:0%
everybody that was at the same level the
 
03:30:14.570 --> 03:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
previous year and we do that for every
 
03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
score on the test so then we look at all
 
03:30:19.250 --> 03:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
the kids that scored a 261 how do they
 
03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
do the next year and if you're in the
 
03:30:24.170 --> 03:30:24.180 align:start position:0%
95th percentile means that compared to
 
03:30:27.410 --> 03:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
your similar peers the prior year you
 
03:30:29.690 --> 03:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
grew after academically more than 95
 
03:30:31.849 --> 03:30:31.859 align:start position:0%
percent of that group versus if you're
 
03:30:34.309 --> 03:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
in the 10th percentile you only grew
 
03:30:35.870 --> 03:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
more than 10 percent of the students
 
03:30:37.729 --> 03:30:37.739 align:start position:0%
that scored the same way you did the
 
03:30:39.530 --> 03:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
previous year
 
03:30:41.630 --> 03:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
but it gets mathematically a little bit
 
03:30:42.769 --> 03:30:42.779 align:start position:0%
complicated so we actually look at the
 
03:30:44.929 --> 03:30:44.939 align:start position:0%
previous two years and we kind of factor
 
03:30:47.630 --> 03:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
in a a model that predicts what how
 
03:30:49.610 --> 03:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
students should be growing based off of
 
03:30:51.769 --> 03:30:51.779 align:start position:0%
comparisons to their own peers so it's
 
03:30:52.729 --> 03:30:52.739 align:start position:0%
not necessarily whether they're
 
03:30:55.010 --> 03:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
proficient or not proficient but it's
 
03:30:59.269 --> 03:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
looking at their similar peer group how
 
03:31:00.950 --> 03:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
much they continue to grow great on
 
03:31:03.530 --> 03:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
grade on the state assessment
 
03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
03:31:09.190 --> 03:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
yep so are those student percentiles and
 
03:31:11.530 --> 03:31:11.540 align:start position:0%
assessments of growth
 
03:31:13.729 --> 03:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
district-wide school-wide Statewide
 
03:31:13.739 --> 03:31:14.809 align:start position:0%
district-wide school-wide Statewide
Statewide

03:31:14.809 --> 03:31:14.819 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
03:31:16.690 --> 03:31:16.700 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:31:19.309 --> 03:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you thank you
 
03:31:21.530 --> 03:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
same thing on this fall up to seven
 
03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
percent so Pace here and the definition
 
03:31:26.990 --> 03:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
of growth Pace would mean the percentage
 
03:31:28.969 --> 03:31:28.979 align:start position:0%
the number you're talking about they
 
03:31:31.070 --> 03:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
move through the Pacific the percentage
 
03:31:32.690 --> 03:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
of movement
 
03:31:35.389 --> 03:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah exactly
 
03:31:37.490 --> 03:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
um a kind of a metaphor if you think
 
03:31:37.500 --> 03:31:38.210 align:start position:0%
um a kind of a metaphor if you think
about

03:31:38.210 --> 03:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:31:39.290 --> 03:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
um if you've got a whole bunch of cars
 
03:31:41.229 --> 03:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
that are stopped I understand
 
03:31:43.190 --> 03:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
but that's what pacemet in this
 
03:31:45.710 --> 03:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
definition represents oh yeah the pace
 
03:31:47.950 --> 03:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
of student yes yes
 
03:31:50.469 --> 03:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about Pace from before
 
03:31:56.269 --> 03:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
yep two different ad space yeah thanks
 
03:31:59.469 --> 03:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
how much time is usually involved in the
 
03:32:02.870 --> 03:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
test interval between when you start and
 
03:32:05.330 --> 03:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
where you're measuring is it a year
 
03:32:07.849 --> 03:32:07.859 align:start position:0%
it's it's generally about a year it can
 
03:32:10.550 --> 03:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
vary schools have a pretty large testing
 
03:32:12.410 --> 03:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
window it opens up usually around the
 
03:32:14.030 --> 03:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
end of March and goes through about the
 
03:32:15.830 --> 03:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of June so it depends on when
 
03:32:20.269 --> 03:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:22.370 --> 03:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
further questions represent cordelli
 
03:32:25.630 --> 03:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
thank you just wondering if these
 
03:32:25.640 --> 03:32:27.429 align:start position:0%
thank you just wondering if these
definitions

03:32:27.429 --> 03:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
03:32:30.309 --> 03:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
would be reflected on the I platform
 
03:32:34.130 --> 03:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
definition section uh what's there now
 
03:32:36.050 --> 03:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
is that the current
 
03:32:37.910 --> 03:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
um and then you would once finalized
 
03:32:40.070 --> 03:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
with the Senate version you would move
 
03:32:43.370 --> 03:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
them over to that or is it a combination
 
03:32:46.370 --> 03:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
of the two I think that's a great point
 
03:32:47.510 --> 03:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
that you brought up we should double
 
03:32:49.250 --> 03:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
check that they reflect the same thing
 
03:32:52.130 --> 03:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
yes for the most part they should yeah
 
03:32:54.830 --> 03:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
they should be helping but that's that
 
03:32:56.750 --> 03:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
is a good reminder for us to do that if
 
03:33:02.469 --> 03:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:04.550 --> 03:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:33:06.590 --> 03:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
and I wrote in one thing after your
 
03:33:08.750 --> 03:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
definition here and I just
 
03:33:10.790 --> 03:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
when you say growth means measurement of
 
03:33:12.349 --> 03:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
the pace of student achievement over
 
03:33:14.929 --> 03:33:14.939 align:start position:0%
time on the Statewide assessment yeah as
 
03:33:16.370 --> 03:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
measured using student growth
 
03:33:16.380 --> 03:33:18.170 align:start position:0%
measured using student growth
percentiles

03:33:18.170 --> 03:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
percentiles
 
03:33:20.990 --> 03:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
there are that are consistent with
 
03:33:21.000 --> 03:33:22.790 align:start position:0%
there are that are consistent with
statistical

03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
statistical
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:29.690 --> 03:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
yes and we can we can make predictions
 
03:33:31.610 --> 03:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
when we look at achievement and growth
 
03:33:34.250 --> 03:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
together side by side so for example you
 
03:33:36.349 --> 03:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
might have a student who is in the below
 
03:33:40.190 --> 03:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
proficient range and compared to the
 
03:33:43.070 --> 03:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
rest of their peers we know on a
 
03:33:44.809 --> 03:33:44.819 align:start position:0%
percentage basis how much growth they
 
03:33:47.750 --> 03:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
have to make in order to move from say
 
03:33:49.370 --> 03:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
below proficient to approaching
 
03:33:51.769 --> 03:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
proficient so we can use that
 
03:33:53.630 --> 03:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
statistical analysis to create these
 
03:33:55.610 --> 03:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
predictive models and estimate how much
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
growth do students need to make each
 
03:33:59.570 --> 03:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
year to move from where they're at up to
 
03:34:01.429 --> 03:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
a level of proficiency
 
03:34:03.170 --> 03:34:03.180 align:start position:0%
and that's one way actually that we
 
03:34:05.150 --> 03:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
measure our English language Learners
 
03:34:07.130 --> 03:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
specifically each year we have to track
 
03:34:09.290 --> 03:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
whether they're on track to meeting
 
03:34:12.170 --> 03:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
proficiency within five years and we use
 
03:34:14.570 --> 03:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
this model of growth to make sure is the
 
03:34:16.849 --> 03:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
pace of student achievement following
 
03:34:18.650 --> 03:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
that expected path of growth so that
 
03:34:20.750 --> 03:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
within five years they're becoming
 
03:34:23.590 --> 03:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
proficient in English language
 
03:34:26.570 --> 03:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
okay let's move on to page
 
03:34:26.580 --> 03:35:04.490 align:start position:0%
okay let's move on to page

03:35:06.710 --> 03:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
your definition of school here is this
 
03:35:10.010 --> 03:35:10.020 align:start position:0%

yes everything in e 193e
 
03:35:19.130 --> 03:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
because there's references to other
 
03:35:21.950 --> 03:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
types of schools within this area of

03:36:35.700 --> 03:36:39.550 align:start position:0%
 
think

03:36:39.550 --> 03:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:41.769 --> 03:36:41.779 align:start position:0%
go ahead no
 
03:36:46.190 --> 03:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
so as you I'm concerned about the issue
 
03:36:48.769 --> 03:36:48.779 align:start position:0%
we're authorized by New Hampshire State
 
03:36:50.750 --> 03:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
Board of Education
 
03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
and what other kinds of schools
 
03:36:57.110 --> 03:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
might be defined I'll give you some
 
03:36:57.120 --> 03:36:58.670 align:start position:0%
might be defined I'll give you some
examples

03:36:58.670 --> 03:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
examples
 
03:37:02.090 --> 03:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
for example with prenda could that be a
 
03:37:04.670 --> 03:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
pot of friend that could that be defined
 
03:37:06.910 --> 03:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
by the the
 
03:37:10.330 --> 03:37:10.340 align:start position:0%
State Board as a school another example
 
03:37:15.650 --> 03:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
might be a learning center where EFA
 
03:37:18.849 --> 03:37:18.859 align:start position:0%
students come together periodically
 
03:37:22.490 --> 03:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
to share resources Etc
 
03:37:24.650 --> 03:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
so that's my first question is what
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
other kinds of schools are we talking
 
03:37:28.190 --> 03:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
about one and two
 
03:37:31.130 --> 03:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
by that definition once they reach a
 
03:37:34.010 --> 03:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
definition would they then qualify for
 
03:37:37.309 --> 03:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid if it's approved by this if
 
03:37:39.469 --> 03:37:39.479 align:start position:0%
those kinds of schools I just talked
 
03:37:46.429 --> 03:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:46.439 --> 03:37:48.849 align:start position:0%
 
really

03:37:48.849 --> 03:37:48.859 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:37:51.170 --> 03:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
so the the schools that are approved by
 
03:37:52.670 --> 03:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education have in
 
03:37:55.070 --> 03:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
State Statute very specific
 
03:37:57.469 --> 03:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
processes for approval so non-public
 
03:37:59.690 --> 03:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
Schools public schools and Charter
 
03:38:01.130 --> 03:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
Schools there's whole sections of law
 
03:38:05.389 --> 03:38:05.399 align:start position:0%
that that require that so
 
03:38:08.809 --> 03:38:08.819 align:start position:0%
I would think that you know to
 
03:38:10.910 --> 03:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
have Brenda approved by the State Board
 
03:38:12.590 --> 03:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
of Education you would have to write a
 
03:38:15.410 --> 03:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
prenda approval section and then then
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
require the friend of school to ensure
 
03:38:18.530 --> 03:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
that they're providing an adequate
 
03:38:21.349 --> 03:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
education through ibas and pbas
 
03:38:24.410 --> 03:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
and then then also write a separate
 
03:38:25.550 --> 03:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
section saying that they would be
 
03:38:27.170 --> 03:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
eligible for Aid so I think that would
 
03:38:27.180 --> 03:38:28.190 align:start position:0%
eligible for Aid so I think that would
need

03:38:28.190 --> 03:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:38:32.210 --> 03:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
entirely separate legislation outside of
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
this section here we're trying to find
 
03:38:38.269 --> 03:38:38.279 align:start position:0%
here who is required to participate in
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
ibas and pbas essentially
 
03:38:43.429 --> 03:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
so you're saying you're saying that in
 
03:38:44.750 --> 03:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
order for
 
03:38:47.929 --> 03:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
a non-traditional School
 
03:38:51.290 --> 03:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
to be approved under this language
 
03:38:54.170 --> 03:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
they would have to comply with the other
 
03:38:57.229 --> 03:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
parts of the law that defines
 
03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
specifically what a public school would
 
03:39:00.650 --> 03:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
be is that correct
 
03:39:06.769 --> 03:39:06.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:10.969 --> 03:39:10.979 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner thank you so a school
 
03:39:14.269 --> 03:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
approved for tuition purposes
 
03:39:16.550 --> 03:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
um that approval is with the school
 
03:39:18.590 --> 03:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
board that contracts with the school I
 
03:39:21.290 --> 03:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
think that is correct okay so that is
 
03:39:21.300 --> 03:39:22.870 align:start position:0%
think that is correct okay so that is
beyond

03:39:22.870 --> 03:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
03:39:26.389 --> 03:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh just being authorized by the new by
 
03:39:27.950 --> 03:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire State Board of
 
03:39:30.170 --> 03:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
Education isn't that school doesn't is
 
03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
not required to provide adequate
 
03:39:33.530 --> 03:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
education through this definition it's
 
03:39:35.330 --> 03:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
not required to participate in ibas and
 
03:39:37.190 --> 03:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
pbas the local school district is
 
03:39:38.809 --> 03:39:38.819 align:start position:0%
responsible for ensuring that they're
 
03:39:40.849 --> 03:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
providing a school an adequate education
 
03:39:43.309 --> 03:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
but that school that they're tuitioning
 
03:39:47.450 --> 03:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:49.969 --> 03:39:49.979 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't when they do the
 
03:39:51.950 --> 03:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
approval they don't have to they aren't
 
03:39:54.530 --> 03:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
compelled to to
 
03:39:56.750 --> 03:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
to provide an adequate education for
 
03:39:58.550 --> 03:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
their students the items the items
 
03:40:01.790 --> 03:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
within 193 to a so that that 12 bolted
 
03:40:03.170 --> 03:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
list to refer back to the minimum
 
03:40:04.849 --> 03:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
standards there's a requirement in
 
03:40:07.969 --> 03:40:07.979 align:start position:0%
school tuition programs that those items
 
03:40:10.130 --> 03:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
are outlined in the contract between the
 
03:40:11.630 --> 03:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
local school district and the tuition
 
03:40:13.969 --> 03:40:13.979 align:start position:0%
program so it's not that the tuition
 
03:40:17.809 --> 03:40:17.819 align:start position:0%
program has to follow 193e to a but
 
03:40:19.190 --> 03:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
they're required to adhere to the
 
03:40:20.690 --> 03:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
contract that they have with the local
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
public school which must include
 
03:40:24.530 --> 03:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
elements that you can find within there
 
03:40:27.769 --> 03:40:27.779 align:start position:0%
so it's it's similar but it's not quite
 
03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
the same if that makes sense there's
 
03:40:32.150 --> 03:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
elements of the adequate education but
 
03:40:33.650 --> 03:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
it's they don't have to comply with the
 
03:40:34.969 --> 03:40:34.979 align:start position:0%
statute they have to comply with the
 
03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
contract that they've written with the
 
03:40:44.630 --> 03:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:46.490 --> 03:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cascade can I just
 
03:40:48.290 --> 03:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
carry that a little further so that I
 
03:40:50.809 --> 03:40:50.819 align:start position:0%
can understand
 
03:40:53.330 --> 03:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
from Representatives Tanner's question
 
03:40:56.030 --> 03:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
on tuition schools
 
03:40:57.889 --> 03:40:57.899 align:start position:0%
they have to comply the contract that
 
03:41:00.889 --> 03:41:00.899 align:start position:0%
they have with the public school
 
03:41:03.830 --> 03:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
but they don't have to meet adequate
 
03:41:08.210 --> 03:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
education or minimum standards
 
03:41:11.330 --> 03:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
and still get adequacy Aid
 
03:41:13.910 --> 03:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
because that makes the adequacy aid goes
 
03:41:16.070 --> 03:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
to the local public school and then that
 
03:41:18.050 --> 03:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
local public school has a contract by
 
03:41:19.670 --> 03:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
which they're paying a certain amount
 
03:41:21.110 --> 03:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
for the tuition for the students are
 
03:41:23.330 --> 03:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
going to those programs and then that
 
03:41:25.130 --> 03:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
contract has other requirements that are
 
03:41:26.510 --> 03:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
outside of this section I believe it's
 
03:41:26.520 --> 03:41:27.910 align:start position:0%
outside of this section I believe it's
in

03:41:27.910 --> 03:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:41:31.729 --> 03:41:31.739 align:start position:0%
194 something it does reference this
 
03:41:33.950 --> 03:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
section but it references it in terms of
 
03:41:35.809 --> 03:41:35.819 align:start position:0%
what's required in the contract that the
 
03:41:39.469 --> 03:41:39.479 align:start position:0%
local school district creates so they do
 
03:41:41.090 --> 03:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
have to follow certain aspects of
 
03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
inadequate education because it's
 
03:41:45.170 --> 03:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
required to be in the contract but that
 
03:41:47.030 --> 03:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
tuition program is not held to this
 
03:41:48.830 --> 03:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
specific statute it's a separate statute
 
03:41:52.130 --> 03:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
okay and I think I'm confusing
 
03:41:54.110 --> 03:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
tuition school with
 
03:41:57.410 --> 03:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
right non-public schools oh okay
 
03:41:57.420 --> 03:41:58.429 align:start position:0%
right non-public schools oh okay
right

03:41:58.429 --> 03:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:42:00.710 --> 03:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
some of them may be non-public schools
 
03:42:00.720 --> 03:42:03.830 align:start position:0%
some of them may be non-public schools
right

03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:03.840 --> 03:42:06.050 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:42:06.050 --> 03:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:42:09.229 --> 03:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
president Miler now it just occurred to
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
me as we look at these changes and
 
03:42:14.210 --> 03:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
others that we'll be looking at
 
03:42:17.229 --> 03:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
how are they complying with the proposed
 
03:42:21.650 --> 03:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
so the 306 standards set up the
 
03:42:25.910 --> 03:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
requirements in many of those areas that
 
03:42:28.190 --> 03:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
are then referenced from this particular
 
03:42:30.469 --> 03:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
statute so those those particular
 
03:42:34.309 --> 03:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
criteria reference the 306s if there are
 
03:42:36.889 --> 03:42:36.899 align:start position:0%
changes made to those 306 standards then
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
those would be the standards that this
 
03:42:42.650 --> 03:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
is this is referring to so once well I
 
03:42:44.090 --> 03:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
know you're going through a series of
 
03:42:45.769 --> 03:42:45.779 align:start position:0%
public hearings now which is great to
 
03:42:48.590 --> 03:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
get a lot of input once those standards
 
03:42:51.469 --> 03:42:51.479 align:start position:0%
have been approved by the state board
 
03:42:53.210 --> 03:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the future
 
03:42:55.790 --> 03:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
there will then be another review
 
03:42:58.790 --> 03:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
of how those standards comply with the
 
03:43:00.530 --> 03:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
current law and the current law then
 
03:43:03.530 --> 03:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
would have to be changed no so the
 
03:43:05.450 --> 03:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
current law refers to the sections of
 
03:43:07.309 --> 03:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
standards and those sections of stand so
 
03:43:10.190 --> 03:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
the law states the law
 
03:43:11.870 --> 03:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
um and it just refers to a section of
 
03:43:13.190 --> 03:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
standard so that section of Standards
 
03:43:14.630 --> 03:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
might change but the law is still going
 
03:43:16.849 --> 03:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
to refer to that section
 
03:43:20.330 --> 03:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
that makes sense so this proposal
 
03:43:23.750 --> 03:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
essentially is entirely unimpacted by
 
03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
the current minimum standard change
 
03:43:31.610 --> 03:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
or proposed change and then when I must
 
03:43:33.530 --> 03:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
have missed it when the proposed changes
 
03:43:36.889 --> 03:43:36.899 align:start position:0%
are enacted how does how do they then
 
03:43:39.530 --> 03:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
relate to this so This section of law
 
03:43:41.990 --> 03:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
refers to those
 
03:43:45.050 --> 03:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
those sections but this is not changing
 
03:43:46.610 --> 03:43:46.620 align:start position:0%
so if they were
 
03:43:49.849 --> 03:43:49.859 align:start position:0%
so the changes to and maybe if you go
 
03:43:51.410 --> 03:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
this might be actually a question for
 
03:43:54.889 --> 03:43:54.899 align:start position:0%
page 17. okay yeah because then you can
 
03:43:58.969 --> 03:43:58.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:01.130 --> 03:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon
 
03:44:02.990 --> 03:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:44:04.790 --> 03:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
you may have already answered this but
 
03:44:07.729 --> 03:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear
 
03:44:10.670 --> 03:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
what are or who are
 
03:44:13.250 --> 03:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
the schools that are the or in this
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
statement so the or authorized by the
 
03:44:17.510 --> 03:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Board of Education
 
03:44:19.070 --> 03:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
since it's or they're not District
 
03:44:20.510 --> 03:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
public they're not chartered public
 
03:44:22.790 --> 03:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
they're not public academies so who are
 
03:44:22.800 --> 03:44:24.469 align:start position:0%
they're not public academies so who are
they

03:44:24.469 --> 03:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:44:26.510 --> 03:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
um there might be a couple of situations
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
so uh Rivendell for example is an
 
03:44:30.469 --> 03:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
interstate school that is primarily
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
operated by Vermont that includes New
 
03:44:34.309 --> 03:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students in it and there's an
 
03:44:36.050 --> 03:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
authorization by our state board of
 
03:44:37.370 --> 03:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
education to allow those students to
 
03:44:39.710 --> 03:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
attend Rivendell but they remain New
 
03:44:42.530 --> 03:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public School students we have
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
many schools that are authorized under
 
03:44:46.610 --> 03:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
our Bureau of special education to act
 
03:44:48.110 --> 03:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
as private providers that are out of
 
03:44:49.969 --> 03:44:49.979 align:start position:0%
state so they're authorized by the State
 
03:44:51.410 --> 03:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
Board of Education to provide
 
03:44:53.330 --> 03:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
specialized special education services
 
03:44:55.490 --> 03:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
in a residential placement but they may
 
03:44:58.010 --> 03:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
exist in Massachusetts or Connecticut or
 
03:45:00.410 --> 03:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
South Carolina so there are examples
 
03:45:02.690 --> 03:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
where we have authorized schools but
 
03:45:04.010 --> 03:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily A New Hampshire
 
03:45:04.020 --> 03:45:07.370 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily A New Hampshire
school

03:45:07.370 --> 03:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:09.050 --> 03:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
and those students are still required to
 
03:45:13.490 --> 03:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:13.500 --> 03:45:15.050 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:45:15.050 --> 03:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:45:19.070 --> 03:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
so I understand that clearly thank you
 
03:45:21.830 --> 03:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
but this doesn't limit that definition
 
03:45:25.250 --> 03:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
to those kinds of schools
 
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
across state line special ed or a shared
 
03:45:30.590 --> 03:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
School District I think we can certainly
 
03:45:32.510 --> 03:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
can I yeah we can clean up the
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
definition I'm not married to this
 
03:45:35.769 --> 03:45:35.779 align:start position:0%
definition personally so
 
03:45:35.779 --> 03:45:38.229 align:start position:0%
definition personally so
Partners

03:45:38.229 --> 03:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
Partners
 
03:45:40.010 --> 03:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
right now there's no definition of
 
03:45:41.690 --> 03:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
school so that's what you're trying to
 
03:45:45.830 --> 03:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:46.969 --> 03:45:46.979 align:start position:0%
there are a number of school
 
03:45:49.610 --> 03:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
environments in here we use as a measure
 
03:45:53.210 --> 03:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
an indicator of delivering an adequate
 
03:45:53.220 --> 03:45:54.469 align:start position:0%
an indicator of delivering an adequate
education

03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:45:55.729 --> 03:45:55.739 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to go back to Career
 
03:45:57.710 --> 03:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
Technical education again when we had to
 
03:45:59.330 --> 03:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
commission back
 
03:46:01.729 --> 03:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
several years ago there was discussion
 
03:46:04.010 --> 03:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
that came from another member who was on
 
03:46:06.889 --> 03:46:06.899 align:start position:0%
the CTE advisory Council that why isn't
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
CT part of adequacy
 
03:46:12.469 --> 03:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
and when I'm seeing it identified
 
03:46:15.849 --> 03:46:15.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:20.450 --> 03:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
555 of the law book here which is 193e
 
03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
colon 3 when we talk about the number
 
03:46:25.070 --> 03:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
and percentage of students earning a
 
03:46:28.190 --> 03:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
career in Tech education outcome and
 
03:46:30.769 --> 03:46:30.779 align:start position:0%
then I see it later when we talk
 
03:46:34.849 --> 03:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
specifically of CTE students on page 556
 
03:46:37.190 --> 03:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
which are also
 
03:46:37.200 --> 03:46:38.110 align:start position:0%
which are also
um

03:46:38.110 --> 03:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:41.809 --> 03:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
a part of the indicator for receiving
 
03:46:43.130 --> 03:46:43.140 align:start position:0%
that opportunity for an adequate
 
03:46:46.010 --> 03:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
education so are those not considered
 
03:46:46.020 --> 03:46:47.330 align:start position:0%
education so are those not considered
schools

03:46:47.330 --> 03:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:46:50.750 --> 03:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
I know they're within a school district
 
03:46:53.570 --> 03:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
but there you know they are
 
03:46:57.590 --> 03:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
separate buildings facilities for a
 
03:46:59.389 --> 03:46:59.399 align:start position:0%
separate purpose
 
03:47:01.190 --> 03:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
so generally those are considered
 
03:47:03.769 --> 03:47:03.779 align:start position:0%
programs there are CTE centers that are
 
03:47:05.150 --> 03:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
are large enough that have enough
 
03:47:07.190 --> 03:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
offerings that really are considered
 
03:47:09.229 --> 03:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
Standalone schools but they're operated
 
03:47:11.870 --> 03:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
by districts and for the most part CT
 
03:47:15.170 --> 03:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
programs exist as one opportunity that
 
03:47:17.090 --> 03:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
students can access as part of a larger
 
03:47:20.389 --> 03:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
District's curriculum so to to really be
 
03:47:22.550 --> 03:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
considered a school they would have to
 
03:47:25.309 --> 03:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
be able to follow all aspects of the
 
03:47:27.349 --> 03:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
adequate education the minimum standards
 
03:47:29.570 --> 03:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
they'd have to be diploma granting so
 
03:47:31.070 --> 03:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's certainly something that you
 
03:47:32.990 --> 03:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
could do but I don't think all of our
 
03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
CTE centers necessarily fit that
 
03:47:34.920 --> 03:47:38.090 align:start position:0%
CTE centers necessarily fit that
definition

03:47:38.090 --> 03:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:43.250 --> 03:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:45.190 --> 03:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's right yeah
 
03:47:47.210 --> 03:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
going down
 
03:47:51.550 --> 03:47:51.560 align:start position:0%
going down to the very bottom of uh 15
 
03:47:53.830 --> 03:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
you've eliminated
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
a whole suction
 
03:47:59.990 --> 03:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
that deals with TSI schools
 
03:48:02.690 --> 03:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
why is that
 
03:48:10.849 --> 03:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:15.710 --> 03:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:15.720 --> 03:48:17.090 align:start position:0%
 
Jesus

03:48:17.090 --> 03:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
Jesus
 
03:48:19.969 --> 03:48:19.979 align:start position:0%
because what's this section in
 
03:48:24.969 --> 03:48:24.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:27.050 --> 03:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
because I think we just refer back to
 
03:48:29.630 --> 03:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
the plan so I think I think we don't use
 
03:48:31.550 --> 03:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
TSI through I think we just refer back
 
03:48:33.050 --> 03:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
to the plan I don't think we're actually
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
using TSI and of itself so this we just
 
03:48:38.150 --> 03:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
removed the definition we can double
 
03:48:39.710 --> 03:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
check that but I think that's why we did
 
03:48:42.110 --> 03:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
that okay that's good thank you wasn't
 
03:48:43.729 --> 03:48:43.739 align:start position:0%
used independently
 
03:48:45.769 --> 03:48:45.779 align:start position:0%
um we do actually need to talk about CSI
 
03:48:48.530 --> 03:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
versus TSI when we come further on
 
03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
um and that might be the reason for that
 
03:48:52.250 --> 03:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
that's why this movie defined separately
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's yeah it is defined
 
03:48:56.030 --> 03:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
separately so we need yeah the content
 
03:48:57.469 --> 03:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
itself sort of just moved to another
 
03:48:59.269 --> 03:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
section and there's a lot of language
 
03:49:00.830 --> 03:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
that we actually removed only because
 
03:49:03.469 --> 03:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
it's just duplicative of the plan and we
 
03:49:05.210 --> 03:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
didn't feel like it was necessary to
 
03:49:07.010 --> 03:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
have it if we were referring back to the
 
03:49:10.010 --> 03:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
state plan I think for example
 
03:49:11.330 --> 03:49:11.340 align:start position:0%
um on representative lab was just
 
03:49:12.710 --> 03:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:49:15.889 --> 03:49:15.899 align:start position:0%
um where we refer on page 555 to the
 
03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
College and Career Readiness indicators
 
03:49:19.729 --> 03:49:19.739 align:start position:0%
I believe we completely removed those
 
03:49:21.410 --> 03:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
and just referred to back to the college
 
03:49:22.969 --> 03:49:22.979 align:start position:0%
in your career at Readiness indicators
 
03:49:25.370 --> 03:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
as a defined in the plan and then that
 
03:49:26.990 --> 03:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
way that gives us the flexibility if we
 
03:49:28.670 --> 03:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
were to go in and add an additional
 
03:49:31.910 --> 03:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
indicator in the future we wouldn't need
 
03:49:33.650 --> 03:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
to go in and write rewrite the law we
 
03:49:36.530 --> 03:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
would just not modify the plan
 
03:49:38.510 --> 03:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
so you think that this language is
 
03:49:40.429 --> 03:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
someplace else
 
03:49:43.550 --> 03:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
um or not used because we just refer to
 
03:49:43.560 --> 03:49:44.290 align:start position:0%
um or not used because we just refer to
it

03:49:44.290 --> 03:49:44.300 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:49:47.210 --> 03:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
just gets back to us on that yes we'll
 
03:49:51.530 --> 03:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:53.210 --> 03:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
okay Ellen say that again about the
 
03:49:56.030 --> 03:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
indicators you're saying that you have
 
03:49:58.910 --> 03:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
not included the indicators
 
03:50:02.450 --> 03:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
oh let's double check that so the so the
 
03:50:03.710 --> 03:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
indicators yeah the indicators
 
03:50:06.050 --> 03:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
themselves are included later on
 
03:50:07.490 --> 03:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
um in the performance-based
 
03:50:09.290 --> 03:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
accountability system
 
03:50:12.170 --> 03:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
um we we discuss how the that system is
 
03:50:13.309 --> 03:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
aligned to the data and indicators
 
03:50:16.370 --> 03:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
that's within the state Essa plan and
 
03:50:18.050 --> 03:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
that way we reference specifically which
 
03:50:19.610 --> 03:50:19.620 align:start position:0%
indicators we're talking about it is the
 
03:50:21.950 --> 03:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
indicators aligned with our state plan
 
03:50:24.410 --> 03:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
whereas before it just referenced the
 
03:50:26.690 --> 03:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
pbas in general but wasn't specific to
 
03:50:28.250 --> 03:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
where the indicators came from we wanted
 
03:50:29.750 --> 03:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
to actually make sure that people
 
03:50:31.190 --> 03:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
understood within the statute when we
 
03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
talk about pbas it's the indicators from
 
03:50:36.590 --> 03:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:36.600 --> 03:50:47.929 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:50:47.929 --> 03:50:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:51.050 --> 03:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
so we are right now anything on the
 
03:50:55.429 --> 03:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
bottom page 16 or there that you saw
 
03:51:15.710 --> 03:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:19.269 --> 03:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:23.210 --> 03:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
just just a clarification on why the
 
03:51:31.690 --> 03:51:31.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:41.650 --> 03:51:41.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:44.150 --> 03:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
so the word learning when you look at
 
03:51:45.590 --> 03:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards that are being
 
03:51:48.170 --> 03:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
referenced here the minimum standards
 
03:51:51.710 --> 03:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
are either education programs or it just
 
03:51:53.630 --> 03:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
refers to education it doesn't use the
 
03:51:56.990 --> 03:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
word learning so we removed learning
 
03:51:58.729 --> 03:51:58.739 align:start position:0%
areas because in the minimum standards
 
03:52:00.229 --> 03:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
none of those sections are defined as a
 
03:52:01.610 --> 03:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
learning area they're defined as either
 
03:52:06.309 --> 03:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:08.330 --> 03:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
we didn't want people to go looking for
 
03:52:10.250 --> 03:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
a learning area it was called that here
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:30.710 --> 03:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
does everybody comprehend what was just
 
03:52:31.729 --> 03:52:31.739 align:start position:0%
said there
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
no I don't either okay so in the minimum
 
03:52:36.410 --> 03:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
standards each of these areas English
 
03:52:38.090 --> 03:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
mathematics science they're called
 
03:52:40.849 --> 03:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
programs so learning areas
 
03:52:42.410 --> 03:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
well so in the middle of Standards
 
03:52:44.450 --> 03:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
they're referred to as program areas and
 
03:52:45.769 --> 03:52:45.779 align:start position:0%
here in the statute talks about learning
 
03:52:47.570 --> 03:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
areas so we could change one or the
 
03:52:49.429 --> 03:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
other I think it's just helpful to make
 
03:52:52.010 --> 03:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
them consistent I think
 
03:52:53.809 --> 03:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
we just got rid of the descriptor and
 
03:52:55.790 --> 03:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
just an area it can be a learning area
 
03:53:06.469 --> 03:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:08.570 --> 03:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
everything used to be known as a subject
 
03:53:08.580 --> 03:53:11.570 align:start position:0%
everything used to be known as a subject
area

03:53:11.570 --> 03:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:14.450 --> 03:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
okay the subject area that could be
 
03:53:17.690 --> 03:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
ready yeah content area so we just use
 
03:53:19.550 --> 03:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
the word area so then that can compare
 
03:53:21.950 --> 03:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
you so because the areas are very
 
03:53:25.250 --> 03:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
clearly defined as you know as below so
 
03:53:26.750 --> 03:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
why don't you put following content
 
03:53:26.760 --> 03:53:36.170 align:start position:0%
why don't you put following content
areas

03:53:36.170 --> 03:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
it does actually use the word content in
 
03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
the in the title there so that's it
 
03:53:41.990 --> 03:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's funny because in Roman numeral
 
03:53:45.530 --> 03:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
nine years again and it's not struck out
 
03:53:51.590 --> 03:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:53.870 --> 03:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
so let you each time I know so Nate
 
03:53:56.210 --> 03:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
you're good with that I I'm yeah I
 
03:53:57.410 --> 03:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
hesitate to point out that in the next
 
03:53:58.969 --> 03:53:58.979 align:start position:0%
paragraph it also uses learning areas
 
03:54:00.530 --> 03:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
and we did not strike that out so we may
 
03:54:03.050 --> 03:54:03.060 align:start position:0%
want to do the same
 
03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
taking Roman numeral nine change that to
 
03:54:12.710 --> 03:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:16.370 --> 03:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:19.269 --> 03:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
no you said Roman nine
 
03:54:30.590 --> 03:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:32.750 --> 03:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
we should be consistent be consistent
 
03:54:34.570 --> 03:54:34.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:54:39.889 --> 03:54:39.899 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes uh why again why was the in
 
03:54:42.530 --> 03:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
when you deal with art education
 
03:54:46.849 --> 03:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
the elimination of music and visual arts
 
03:54:49.070 --> 03:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
do we Define art education someplace
 
03:54:52.670 --> 03:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
else that includes that so there are two
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
lists that existed in statute and they
 
03:54:56.570 --> 03:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
had some minor differences with each
 
03:54:56.580 --> 03:54:57.349 align:start position:0%
had some minor differences with each
other

03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:55:00.830 --> 03:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
I thought we had kept that in so on one
 
03:55:02.929 --> 03:55:02.939 align:start position:0%
side it has
 
03:55:05.990 --> 03:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
so on page 22 it does include that
 
03:55:07.309 --> 03:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
no it doesn't
 
03:55:10.210 --> 03:55:10.220 align:start position:0%
do it is that removed
 
03:55:12.710 --> 03:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
yeah it is in the minimum standards when
 
03:55:14.210 --> 03:55:14.220 align:start position:0%
you look at the Arts education program
 
03:55:16.670 --> 03:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
music and visual arts are part of those
 
03:55:19.070 --> 03:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
standards whether we call them out here
 
03:55:20.510 --> 03:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
or not
 
03:55:20.520 --> 03:55:21.650 align:start position:0%
or not
um

03:55:21.650 --> 03:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:24.170 --> 03:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
I it was not I don't think it was an
 
03:55:26.030 --> 03:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
intentional I think we're just cleaning
 
03:55:27.710 --> 03:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
up to match the titles that were within
 
03:55:29.510 --> 03:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards we were matching
 
03:55:31.370 --> 03:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
the titles and the minimum standards so
 
03:55:32.630 --> 03:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
there's a whole area in the minimum
 
03:55:34.370 --> 03:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
standards has Arts education and within
 
03:55:36.170 --> 03:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
that section it says music and visual
 
03:55:37.969 --> 03:55:37.979 align:start position:0%
arts and they're defined there further
 
03:55:40.309 --> 03:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
so when we're looking at the titles of
 
03:55:41.689 --> 03:55:41.699 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards that's what we're
 
03:55:41.699 --> 03:55:44.269 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards that's what we're
doing

03:55:44.269 --> 03:55:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:46.429 --> 03:55:46.439 align:start position:0%
so whether it's here or not schools are
 
03:55:48.170 --> 03:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
still required to do it because it's in
 
03:55:56.650 --> 03:55:56.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:15.550 --> 03:56:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:23.090 --> 03:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:26.090 --> 03:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
well we put in the the subjects after
 
03:56:28.670 --> 03:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
social studies we did that with adequacy
 
03:56:31.969 --> 03:56:31.979 align:start position:0%
but last year and then we did the other
 
03:56:36.349 --> 03:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
with the health and and Welfare and that
 
03:56:39.650 --> 03:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
also came right out ab306 yeah which we
 
03:56:43.130 --> 03:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:43.140 --> 03:56:46.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:56:46.670 --> 03:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:49.309 --> 03:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
so for example with social studies you
 
03:56:50.929 --> 03:56:50.939 align:start position:0%
do have many different areas those are
 
03:56:52.729 --> 03:56:52.739 align:start position:0%
all part of one section in the minimum
 
03:56:55.070 --> 03:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
standards called social studies except
 
03:56:57.290 --> 03:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
for Holocaust and genocide which is a
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
separate section of the minimum
 
03:56:58.319 --> 03:57:06.170 align:start position:0%
separate section of the minimum
standards

03:57:06.170 --> 03:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:08.570 --> 03:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
we can add that back in we're perfectly
 
03:57:11.330 --> 03:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
fine editing that back in yeah and it's
 
03:57:14.689 --> 03:57:14.699 align:start position:0%
it is a case of is there a specific
 
03:57:16.670 --> 03:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
intention of calling out music and
 
03:57:18.769 --> 03:57:18.779 align:start position:0%
visual arts specifically because Arts
 
03:57:20.689 --> 03:57:20.699 align:start position:0%
education also includes performing arts
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
and dance in the minimum standards so
 
03:57:24.290 --> 03:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
that's in the minimum standards but it's
 
03:57:26.389 --> 03:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
not specifically called out here yet we
 
03:57:28.550 --> 03:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
do call out music so I think part of it
 
03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
is an intention
 
03:57:32.210 --> 03:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not arguing one way or the
 
03:57:34.969 --> 03:57:34.979 align:start position:0%
other way it's if you say Arts education
 
03:57:36.530 --> 03:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
it's going to be everything in arts
 
03:57:38.570 --> 03:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
education which is going to also include
 
03:57:40.670 --> 03:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
things like pottery and artistic
 
03:57:44.090 --> 03:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
expression Dance Performing Arts so
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
we could call everything out we could
 
03:57:47.630 --> 03:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
call some parts of it out we could just
 
03:57:49.070 --> 03:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
say Arts we could just say social
 
03:57:50.809 --> 03:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
science I think it really that makes
 
03:57:50.819 --> 03:57:53.090 align:start position:0%
science I think it really that makes
sense

03:57:53.090 --> 03:57:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:55.370 --> 03:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
100 Cascade
 
03:57:57.710 --> 03:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
um I think I think it originally aligned
 
03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
with certifications because it social
 
03:58:02.450 --> 03:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
studies teacher is not certified in
 
03:58:04.969 --> 03:58:04.979 align:start position:0%
history Civics and all those different
 
03:58:08.750 --> 03:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
sub categories whereas in science right
 
03:58:11.389 --> 03:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
you can get a biology cert chemistry
 
03:58:14.210 --> 03:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
cert physical science cert
 
03:58:18.110 --> 03:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
and I and it's the same for Arts
 
03:58:20.210 --> 03:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
um so I'm wondering if that's why
 
03:58:22.910 --> 03:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
there's a shift of language in different
 
03:58:22.920 --> 03:58:24.229 align:start position:0%
there's a shift of language in different
places

03:58:24.229 --> 03:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
places
 
03:58:26.689 --> 03:58:26.699 align:start position:0%
I don't really have a question but I'm
 
03:58:30.590 --> 03:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
trying to think why you have subsets of
 
03:58:30.600 --> 03:58:32.030 align:start position:0%
trying to think why you have subsets of
science

03:58:32.030 --> 03:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
science
 
03:58:35.570 --> 03:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
and some subsets of Arts and that social
 
03:58:38.150 --> 03:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
studies all in one Clump it made me
 
03:58:41.210 --> 03:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
think of teachers are certified
 
03:58:43.250 --> 03:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
along those
 
03:58:45.950 --> 03:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
areas I mean I I just I mean I know that
 
03:58:47.330 --> 03:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
social studies has been wrote most
 
03:58:49.969 --> 03:58:49.979 align:start position:0%
recently modified and continued to add
 
03:58:51.530 --> 03:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
and like these are the more some of the
 
03:58:53.689 --> 03:58:53.699 align:start position:0%
more recent changes in some of these
 
03:58:53.699 --> 03:58:55.370 align:start position:0%
more recent changes in some of these
areas

03:58:55.370 --> 03:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
areas
 
03:58:59.269 --> 03:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
um but I I mean for consistency purposes
 
03:59:01.309 --> 03:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
I think we'd like to do either
 
03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
all or none so I think we either like to
 
03:59:06.410 --> 03:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
match the minimum standards perfectly or
 
03:59:10.729 --> 03:59:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:13.670 --> 03:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
so when we look at 193c you know the
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
area we talked about assessment
 
03:59:19.189 --> 03:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
193 C5 colon 5.
 
03:59:22.729 --> 03:59:22.739 align:start position:0%
it lets out history geography civics
 
03:59:24.769 --> 03:59:24.779 align:start position:0%
in economics
 
03:59:24.779 --> 03:59:26.510 align:start position:0%
in economics
and

03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:28.490 --> 03:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
so we list them separately it's no
 
03:59:32.929 --> 03:59:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:32.939 --> 03:59:36.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:59:36.830 --> 03:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:38.809 --> 03:59:38.819 align:start position:0%
they are separate learning areas really
 
03:59:41.150 --> 03:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
within just like you can have within
 
03:59:42.889 --> 03:59:42.899 align:start position:0%
Science Biology botany and everything
 
03:59:42.899 --> 03:59:45.889 align:start position:0%
Science Biology botany and everything
else

03:59:45.889 --> 03:59:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:47.809 --> 03:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
and I think this is a good like a good
 
03:59:49.429 --> 03:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
example of we should probably make all
 
03:59:51.229 --> 03:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
three lists while we eliminated the
 
03:59:53.450 --> 03:59:53.460 align:start position:0%
third list made a second list and maybe
 
03:59:54.769 --> 03:59:54.779 align:start position:0%
go back to the assessment side of things
 
03:59:57.530 --> 03:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
and make that list similar and it's it's
 
04:00:00.410 --> 04:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
very hard for us to kind of explain I
 
04:00:01.490 --> 04:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
mean we can't even do it to you I'll
 
04:00:02.929 --> 04:00:02.939 align:start position:0%
explain why there's a difference of
 
04:00:03.950 --> 04:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
these lists and that's what we're saying
 
04:00:05.689 --> 04:00:05.699 align:start position:0%
like let's be consistent throughout
 
04:00:05.699 --> 04:00:07.130 align:start position:0%
like let's be consistent throughout
everywhere

04:00:07.130 --> 04:00:07.140 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
04:00:09.550 --> 04:00:09.560 align:start position:0%
I'll make them all the same yeah yeah
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
boom easy
 
04:00:15.590 --> 04:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
so is so we'll help draft this is the
 
04:00:16.849 --> 04:00:16.859 align:start position:0%
preference of the committee to make them
 
04:00:19.010 --> 04:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
same as the titles in the areas of the
 
04:00:20.990 --> 04:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
minimum standards does that make the
 
04:00:24.490 --> 04:00:24.500 align:start position:0%
most sense make them all the same
 
04:00:27.950 --> 04:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
if they're all titles yeah that way okay
 
04:00:33.050 --> 04:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:34.849 --> 04:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
yes represent all
 
04:00:37.910 --> 04:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would think that on page 22
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's a list we came up with last year
 
04:00:43.250 --> 04:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
I would think that's a list that we
 
04:00:44.150 --> 04:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
should do
 
04:00:50.269 --> 04:00:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:51.950 --> 04:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
because I remember when it came to us we
 
04:00:53.689 --> 04:00:53.699 align:start position:0%
didn't have digital literacy the Senate
 
04:00:56.090 --> 04:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
added digital literacy
 
04:00:58.729 --> 04:00:58.739 align:start position:0%
one of the problems we had was when we
 
04:01:01.510 --> 04:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
broke down the content for a substantive
 
04:01:04.010 --> 04:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh education
 
04:01:06.530 --> 04:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
then we went to the delivery and there
 
04:01:07.790 --> 04:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
were two different columns we didn't
 
04:01:09.290 --> 04:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
match them up
 
04:01:11.510 --> 04:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
right and that that's what we noticed
 
04:01:13.910 --> 04:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
too yeah that's that's the problem right
 
04:01:16.189 --> 04:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
and so we've just said all right now
 
04:01:18.050 --> 04:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
let's just use the one that's here under
 
04:01:21.710 --> 04:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
rsa193 on page 17 and eliminate the one
 
04:01:23.630 --> 04:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
on page 22 and reference back to just
 
04:01:27.170 --> 04:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
17. so then we have just one section
 
04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
so then we'll make them all the same
 
04:01:29.520 --> 04:01:31.309 align:start position:0%
so then we'll make them all the same
exactly

04:01:31.309 --> 04:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
04:01:36.969 --> 04:01:36.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:39.070 --> 04:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
04:01:42.130 --> 04:01:42.140 align:start position:0%
is there another session no no no no
 
04:01:46.070 --> 04:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
down in ten what page you on I'm on 18.
 
04:01:49.670 --> 04:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
I'm still on 18. okay good uh on the 10
 
04:01:52.490 --> 04:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
you said uh you added the Define the
 
04:01:55.250 --> 04:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
school year and minimum credit
 
04:01:58.250 --> 04:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
where is that defined where where is the
 
04:02:02.210 --> 04:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
uh and how does that is that part of the
 
04:02:04.670 --> 04:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
again going back is that part of the 306
 
04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
consideration it is so each of those are
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
defined in the 306s
 
04:02:11.689 --> 04:02:11.699 align:start position:0%
um the minimum school year is actually
 
04:02:14.689 --> 04:02:14.699 align:start position:0%
defined both in statute I think in 190
 
04:02:18.410 --> 04:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
189 10 or 189.1 where you can have a
 
04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
school year of 180 days or an equivalent
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
number of hours and then the minimum
 
04:02:23.990 --> 04:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
standard sets out what those equivalent
 
04:02:26.809 --> 04:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
hours are and then the minimum credit
 
04:02:28.250 --> 04:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
requirements for a high school diploma
 
04:02:30.050 --> 04:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
is also set out in the minimum standards
 
04:02:32.750 --> 04:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
but the reason why this is added in here
 
04:02:34.490 --> 04:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
because if you go to page 23 in your
 
04:02:36.110 --> 04:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
document when we said we had the two
 
04:02:38.530 --> 04:02:38.540 align:start position:0%
different match to unmatching
 
04:02:41.510 --> 04:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
groups of items so school year
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
requirements and minimum standard for
 
04:02:44.990 --> 04:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
high school diploma are here already on
 
04:02:47.150 --> 04:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
page 23. so thank you we said if we're
 
04:02:48.769 --> 04:02:48.779 align:start position:0%
going to make the two lists match so we
 
04:02:49.969 --> 04:02:49.979 align:start position:0%
needed to put everything in that list
 
04:02:52.309 --> 04:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
here and then refer back to that area
 
04:02:52.319 --> 04:02:54.349 align:start position:0%
here and then refer back to that area
so

04:02:54.349 --> 04:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
because we start we I think we initially
 
04:02:58.130 --> 04:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
did eliminate that because we said well
 
04:02:59.389 --> 04:02:59.399 align:start position:0%
there's already a law that defines that
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
someplace else but we said we're just
 
04:03:02.030 --> 04:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
going to make the two areas match we
 
04:03:08.750 --> 04:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:08.760 --> 04:03:19.269 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:03:19.269 --> 04:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:22.490 --> 04:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
thanks so so I'm sort of I think we're
 
04:03:25.729 --> 04:03:25.739 align:start position:0%
sort of on pages 17 18 19 because it's
 
04:03:29.330 --> 04:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
all yeah turning into that but just
 
04:03:32.750 --> 04:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
going to the to the top of um of section
 
04:03:36.490 --> 04:03:36.500 align:start position:0%
e2a on um on 17
 
04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
does do the changes
 
04:03:39.840 --> 04:03:41.950 align:start position:0%
does do the changes
um

04:03:41.950 --> 04:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:41.960 --> 04:03:44.469 align:start position:0%
um
there

04:03:44.469 --> 04:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:03:47.210 --> 04:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
make any sort of material change into
 
04:03:47.220 --> 04:03:50.030 align:start position:0%
make any sort of material change into
into

04:03:50.030 --> 04:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:03:54.530 --> 04:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
who or what what organization has the um
 
04:03:56.570 --> 04:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
the responsibility
 
04:03:56.580 --> 04:03:57.889 align:start position:0%
the responsibility
for

04:03:57.889 --> 04:03:57.899 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:04:01.309 --> 04:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
ensuring that um
 
04:04:03.410 --> 04:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
that these now what are being called
 
04:04:05.110 --> 04:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
minimum standards
 
04:04:07.670 --> 04:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
are in place
 
04:04:11.809 --> 04:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
in uh in the school
 
04:04:14.990 --> 04:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
no not at all
 
04:04:17.769 --> 04:04:17.779 align:start position:0%
and if are you are yeah
 
04:04:22.189 --> 04:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
yeah in the current law you know we're
 
04:04:24.830 --> 04:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're seeing that these are
 
04:04:27.769 --> 04:04:27.779 align:start position:0%
defined and identified as school board
 
04:04:30.830 --> 04:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry as school approval standards
 
04:04:33.229 --> 04:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
and uh in the following learning areas
 
04:04:36.889 --> 04:04:36.899 align:start position:0%
and um and now it's
 
04:04:39.290 --> 04:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
minimum standards in the following areas
 
04:04:41.689 --> 04:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm just
 
04:04:41.699 --> 04:04:42.790 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm just
um

04:04:42.790 --> 04:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:46.510 --> 04:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
you know just just wondering if if
 
04:04:49.309 --> 04:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
these changes as well as as well as
 
04:04:53.510 --> 04:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
others leading up to this uh make a make
 
04:04:55.969 --> 04:04:55.979 align:start position:0%
a material change into into
 
04:04:57.830 --> 04:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
um you know who's got the responsibility
 
04:04:59.809 --> 04:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
for making sure that these standards are
 
04:05:02.030 --> 04:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
being met so the full title of the
 
04:05:04.070 --> 04:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
regulation is the minimum standards for
 
04:05:05.809 --> 04:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
public school approval right and you
 
04:05:07.969 --> 04:05:07.979 align:start position:0%
sort of got half the title here and half
 
04:05:10.130 --> 04:05:10.140 align:start position:0%
the title here but I think in other
 
04:05:11.809 --> 04:05:11.819 align:start position:0%
places we refer to it as the minimum
 
04:05:13.429 --> 04:05:13.439 align:start position:0%
standards in the following areas so
 
04:05:15.229 --> 04:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
again it was it was making it consistent
 
04:05:17.570 --> 04:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
but they both whether we talk about
 
04:05:18.889 --> 04:05:18.899 align:start position:0%
public school approval standards or
 
04:05:20.630 --> 04:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
minimum standards it's the same set of
 
04:05:23.150 --> 04:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
regulations okay okay
 
04:05:25.910 --> 04:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
um and then and then a sort of a knit
 
04:05:25.920 --> 04:05:27.170 align:start position:0%
um and then and then a sort of a knit
comment

04:05:27.170 --> 04:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:05:30.349 --> 04:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
um I've noticed on some prior pages and
 
04:05:34.429 --> 04:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:37.849 --> 04:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
where did I see it 1920
 
04:05:39.530 --> 04:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:05:43.729 --> 04:05:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:43.739 --> 04:05:47.090 align:start position:0%
 
of

04:05:47.090 --> 04:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:50.330 --> 04:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
this term used for um for public schools
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
is sometimes coming down as as District
 
04:05:55.969 --> 04:05:55.979 align:start position:0%
Public Schools sometimes it's public
 
04:06:00.410 --> 04:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
district schools and and um and I don't
 
04:06:02.510 --> 04:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
know what we want to settle on on that
 
04:06:05.990 --> 04:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
but uh but probably something you know
 
04:06:07.969 --> 04:06:07.979 align:start position:0%
schooled you know
 
04:06:07.979 --> 04:06:08.809 align:start position:0%
schooled you know
um

04:06:08.809 --> 04:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:10.729 --> 04:06:10.739 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
04:06:12.830 --> 04:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I would argue that's that's the
 
04:06:14.809 --> 04:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
case throughout this entire box
 
04:06:16.670 --> 04:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
assistant yeah yeah so we would love to
 
04:06:19.490 --> 04:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
see that consistency from page one to
 
04:06:23.150 --> 04:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
about page 600 yeah yeah yeah and and
 
04:06:25.990 --> 04:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
then and then sort of related to that
 
04:06:29.510 --> 04:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
Charter Public Schools fall into two
 
04:06:31.309 --> 04:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
categories State chartered public
 
04:06:32.929 --> 04:06:32.939 align:start position:0%
schools and District chartered Public
 
04:06:35.469 --> 04:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
Schools so is there a difference between
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
a a district public school and a
 
04:06:41.990 --> 04:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
district chartered Public School in
 
04:06:46.070 --> 04:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
terms of okay okay so that's free
 
04:06:49.070 --> 04:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
um for an adequate education yes from a
 
04:06:51.469 --> 04:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
from a governance standpoint yes yeah so
 
04:06:53.330 --> 04:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
that there are there are significant
 
04:06:54.830 --> 04:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
differences and then there are overlaps
 
04:06:56.030 --> 04:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
where there are no differences right
 
04:06:57.530 --> 04:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
04:06:58.849 --> 04:06:58.859 align:start position:0%
so what are you talking the difference
 
04:07:00.830 --> 04:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
between a conversion Charter and a rigor
 
04:07:03.349 --> 04:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
Charter not so a conversion chart would
 
04:07:04.969 --> 04:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
be if it was a traditional public school
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
that turned into a charter school so the
 
04:07:09.050 --> 04:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
governance is that way but I think we
 
04:07:10.969 --> 04:07:10.979 align:start position:0%
can also open a chartered school that's
 
04:07:12.889 --> 04:07:12.899 align:start position:0%
still a District chartered school or
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
there can be a standalone State
 
04:07:16.670 --> 04:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
authorized Charter Public School so you
 
04:07:18.170 --> 04:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
theoretically could even have three
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
options though two of them are operated
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
by the district and the governance is
 
04:07:24.410 --> 04:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
interrelated within the public school
 
04:07:26.210 --> 04:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
district as opposed to being a
 
04:07:27.769 --> 04:07:27.779 align:start position:0%
standalone operating chartered Public
 
04:07:27.779 --> 04:07:31.370 align:start position:0%
standalone operating chartered Public
School

04:07:31.370 --> 04:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:31.380 --> 04:07:32.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:07:34.910 --> 04:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
um are we on page 19
 
04:07:38.330 --> 04:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
in there somewhere yeah on on Roman 12
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
there were says Public District Schools
 
04:07:40.680 --> 04:07:41.990 align:start position:0%
there were says Public District Schools
Etc

04:07:41.990 --> 04:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
04:07:44.689 --> 04:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
adhere to the standards are those those
 
04:07:47.090 --> 04:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
are minimum standards right
 
04:07:53.450 --> 04:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:55.490 --> 04:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
so we're talking minimum standards
 
04:07:58.010 --> 04:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
should we have consistency there or if
 
04:07:59.570 --> 04:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
you're just talking standards is that
 
04:08:01.969 --> 04:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
same as minimum standards
 
04:08:01.979 --> 04:08:05.030 align:start position:0%
same as minimum standards
identify

04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:07.849 --> 04:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
and this may so yeah if we go back up to
 
04:08:07.859 --> 04:08:09.950 align:start position:0%
and this may so yeah if we go back up to
eight

04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
eight
 
04:08:09.960 --> 04:08:12.229 align:start position:0%
eight
everything

04:08:12.229 --> 04:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:08:14.450 --> 04:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
that's the list of the minimum standards
 
04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:20.750 --> 04:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
so you're referencing back to the
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
minimum standards the minimum standards
 
04:08:25.490 --> 04:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
in that particular list and so it's 12
 
04:08:29.809 --> 04:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:29.819 --> 04:08:34.130 align:start position:0%
 
correct

04:08:34.130 --> 04:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:38.030 --> 04:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
so as we're taking out this um on
 
04:08:41.090 --> 04:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
several places uh for public school
 
04:08:43.790 --> 04:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
approval for public school approval we
 
04:08:46.849 --> 04:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
did that back a few things
 
04:08:46.859 --> 04:08:48.110 align:start position:0%
did that back a few things
it

04:08:48.110 --> 04:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:08:50.929 --> 04:08:50.939 align:start position:0%
does that Define a school what is a
 
04:08:52.429 --> 04:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
public school versus what is a
 
04:08:55.309 --> 04:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
non-public school no
 
04:08:56.809 --> 04:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
there's a whole separate section of
 
04:08:58.370 --> 04:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
there's a whole separate section of law
 
04:09:00.590 --> 04:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
that talks about a non-public school and
 
04:09:03.110 --> 04:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
then the approval process for that and
 
04:09:05.990 --> 04:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's completely separate from this so
 
04:09:09.769 --> 04:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
I guess you know I I have always been
 
04:09:12.170 --> 04:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
kind of confused of why Charter Schools
 
04:09:14.570 --> 04:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden became Charter Public
 
04:09:18.530 --> 04:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
Schools and when you have the public
 
04:09:20.090 --> 04:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
district schools the Charter Public
 
04:09:22.670 --> 04:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
Schools and public academies and then
 
04:09:24.290 --> 04:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
you're taking away for public school
 
04:09:24.300 --> 04:09:26.030 align:start position:0%
you're taking away for public school
approval

04:09:26.030 --> 04:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
approval
 
04:09:26.040 --> 04:09:26.990 align:start position:0%
approval
um

04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:31.189 --> 04:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
as part of the narrative about these
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
schools and also to ensure the delivery
 
04:09:38.809 --> 04:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education it it just it I
 
04:09:40.189 --> 04:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's just me but it seems
 
04:09:42.650 --> 04:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
like we're taking away removes
 
04:09:46.490 --> 04:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
what what's a public school approval
 
04:09:48.110 --> 04:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's the difference in the
 
04:09:50.750 --> 04:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
intent of the regulations themselves so
 
04:09:53.630 --> 04:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
this refers specifically to the criteria
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
for inadequate education and that's been
 
04:09:58.010 --> 04:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
defined by the legislature as a specific
 
04:10:00.050 --> 04:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
set of the public school approval
 
04:10:01.969 --> 04:10:01.979 align:start position:0%
minimum standards
 
04:10:04.130 --> 04:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
so the public school approval standards
 
04:10:06.349 --> 04:10:06.359 align:start position:0%
in their entirety still apply to all
 
04:10:08.330 --> 04:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
schools and there's a separate process
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
the department can conduct that is a
 
04:10:13.729 --> 04:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
school approval process this doesn't
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
change any of that and that's why we've
 
04:10:17.870 --> 04:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
pulled that out a little bit because
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
when it talks about public school
 
04:10:21.349 --> 04:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
approval in this section it's not
 
04:10:22.969 --> 04:10:22.979 align:start position:0%
relative to approving a public school
 
04:10:24.889 --> 04:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
it's really relative to whether school
 
04:10:26.510 --> 04:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
is providing a minimum adequate
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
education and the school approval
 
04:10:31.610 --> 04:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
process lives outside this section and
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:47.110 --> 04:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:50.450 --> 04:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
04:10:54.349 --> 04:10:54.359 align:start position:0%
if you take adequacy standards away from
 
04:10:56.030 --> 04:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
the definition of a public school
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
approval then
 
04:11:03.010 --> 04:11:03.020 align:start position:0%
then how do you I mean then any school
 
04:11:06.050 --> 04:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
any school could either it's all on the
 
04:11:08.330 --> 04:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
same level they all get approved or
 
04:11:10.189 --> 04:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
non-approved and it doesn't matter if
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
they're Public Schools Charter Schools
 
04:11:14.570 --> 04:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
non-public schools you know what I mean
 
04:11:20.769 --> 04:11:20.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
yeah they're a separate approval
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
processes for uh if you're a non-public
 
04:11:26.450 --> 04:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
school or charter school or a public
 
04:11:29.090 --> 04:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
school so when we talk about adequate
 
04:11:31.550 --> 04:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
education or adequacy adequacy is a
 
04:11:34.070 --> 04:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
subset of the school approval rules but
 
04:11:35.689 --> 04:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
the school approval process itself is
 
04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
much larger than adequacy and so that's
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to pull apart here is
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
that when we say School approval School
 
04:11:44.450 --> 04:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
approval and adequacy are not
 
04:11:46.490 --> 04:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
necessarily the same thing adequacy
 
04:11:48.650 --> 04:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
lives within School approval but School
 
04:11:50.570 --> 04:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
approval itself is a much larger process
 
04:11:53.450 --> 04:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
that exists outside of this section and
 
04:11:55.010 --> 04:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
when we're in this section of Statute we
 
04:11:56.929 --> 04:11:56.939 align:start position:0%
want to refer only to the minimum
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
standards relative to adequacy
 
04:12:04.429 --> 04:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
so isn't isn't adequacy though the
 
04:12:06.650 --> 04:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
Prime reason
 
04:12:09.170 --> 04:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
for schools I mean isn't that the prime
 
04:12:11.809 --> 04:12:11.819 align:start position:0%
reason the the reason we Define adequacy
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
is because that's like the basis of a
 
04:12:18.830 --> 04:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:22.729 --> 04:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:25.790 --> 04:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know yeah you can go on it just
 
04:12:27.229 --> 04:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
so I mean do you think it's something
 
04:12:28.969 --> 04:12:28.979 align:start position:0%
you think of public school right and so
 
04:12:31.370 --> 04:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
adequacy is the core yes and then
 
04:12:33.469 --> 04:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
there's layers on top of it right and so
 
04:12:34.729 --> 04:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do this section
 
04:12:37.070 --> 04:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
right here is specific to the core so to
 
04:12:39.530 --> 04:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
do the to kind of ensure that you have
 
04:12:41.450 --> 04:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
the core you're offering these sections
 
04:12:44.210 --> 04:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
that are here right here and then as a
 
04:12:45.889 --> 04:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
result we're then assessing to make sure
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
that you're right operating those
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
sections and then we're providing
 
04:12:52.250 --> 04:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
funding associated with those sections
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
then there's minimum schools approval
 
04:12:56.330 --> 04:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
which is layers on top of that and
 
04:12:58.010 --> 04:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
that's that whole minimum standards for
 
04:13:00.349 --> 04:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
public school approval all of the 306s
 
04:13:02.929 --> 04:13:02.939 align:start position:0%
which extend to areas Beyond this and
 
04:13:04.490 --> 04:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
then there's other laws throughout this
 
04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
whole book that public schools have to
 
04:13:08.530 --> 04:13:08.540 align:start position:0%
apply or
 
04:13:10.670 --> 04:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
comply with rather that are not
 
04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily part of adequacy so it's
 
04:13:14.510 --> 04:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
kind of all of these different multiple
 
04:13:16.250 --> 04:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
layers right now right here what we're
 
04:13:18.650 --> 04:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
trying to do is just Define that the
 
04:13:20.990 --> 04:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
core layer and then we'll go on from
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
that and then we can start taking part
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
of other sections but we just need that
 
04:13:25.969 --> 04:13:25.979 align:start position:0%
for that base section first and that
 
04:13:28.670 --> 04:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
core makes it a public school right
 
04:13:31.250 --> 04:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
that school that core makes it providing
 
04:13:32.870 --> 04:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
an adequate education
 
04:13:34.849 --> 04:13:34.859 align:start position:0%
or what some people term a government
 
04:13:34.859 --> 04:13:36.590 align:start position:0%
or what some people term a government
School

04:13:36.590 --> 04:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
School
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
there's other things you have to do to
 
04:13:40.189 --> 04:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
be a government school okay outside of
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
providing an adequate education that
 
04:13:43.370 --> 04:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
exists in the minimum standards or
 
04:13:48.769 --> 04:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.779 --> 04:13:53.150 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:13:53.150 --> 04:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:57.349 --> 04:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:59.090 --> 04:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
you look at the first page in your
 
04:14:01.750 --> 04:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
statute it's the very first page
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
on um
 
04:14:09.050 --> 04:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
Roman 2 C it says the Paramount goal of
 
04:14:11.330 --> 04:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
the state shall be to provide an
 
04:14:13.969 --> 04:14:13.979 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
so that's our primary goal I think
 
04:14:17.750 --> 04:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's where you're going represent
 
04:14:20.389 --> 04:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
Tanner yes
 
04:14:20.399 --> 04:14:21.950 align:start position:0%
Tanner yes
okay

04:14:21.950 --> 04:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:14:26.090 --> 04:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:43.550 --> 04:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:43.560 --> 04:14:52.150 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:14:52.150 --> 04:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
yeah well I like the uh have an
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
explanation for the addition of uh 16
 
04:14:59.279 --> 04:15:03.229 align:start position:0%
explanation for the addition of uh 16
was

04:15:03.229 --> 04:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:06.110 --> 04:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
so 16 exists currently in statute it's
 
04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
on page 21 we just moved it because we
 
04:15:10.910 --> 04:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
had re-numbered some of it so it looks
 
04:15:12.290 --> 04:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
like it was pulled out here but it's
 
04:15:15.110 --> 04:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
actually on the next page
 
04:15:17.389 --> 04:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
so it's current Length Kids current
 
04:15:26.450 --> 04:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:29.990 --> 04:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions for these pages
 
04:15:37.809 --> 04:15:37.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:42.830 --> 04:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
no I'm on 20. I'm in the um the center
 
04:15:42.840 --> 04:15:44.450 align:start position:0%
no I'm on 20. I'm in the um the center
version

04:15:44.450 --> 04:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
version
 
04:15:55.250 --> 04:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:01.010 --> 04:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:04.250 --> 04:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
did we move the the legislative
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
04:16:10.370 --> 04:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
from coach statute to we did we did we
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
moved it from the assessment law to the
 
04:16:13.429 --> 04:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
accountability law because so more about
 
04:16:15.830 --> 04:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
accountability than assessment okay so
 
04:16:18.170 --> 04:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
we felt it better it lived in this
 
04:16:21.110 --> 04:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
section better okay and
 
04:16:23.689 --> 04:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
have we already looked at that
 
04:16:26.450 --> 04:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
no I think it's later okay here we
 
04:16:27.769 --> 04:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
didn't change anything we just moved it
 
04:16:31.070 --> 04:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
didn't change anything and and uh what
 
04:16:35.150 --> 04:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
what's what's the current statutory
 
04:16:39.170 --> 04:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
it's currently under is that
 
04:16:39.180 --> 04:16:45.590 align:start position:0%
it's currently under is that
NCAA

04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:47.389 --> 04:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
Rick do you remember where that I'm
 
04:16:48.670 --> 04:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
04:16:51.650 --> 04:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
it's in C8
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:10.800 --> 04:17:58.969 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:17:58.969 --> 04:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:01.750 --> 04:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm bringing this up so so
 
04:18:05.150 --> 04:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
c8a which is the oversight committee
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
right now has some review and approve
 
04:18:14.090 --> 04:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
language in it and
 
04:18:14.100 --> 04:18:15.550 align:start position:0%
language in it and
and

04:18:15.550 --> 04:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:20.750 --> 04:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
Roman 17 talks about prior review and
 
04:18:23.630 --> 04:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation and I'm just I just want
 
04:18:25.130 --> 04:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
to make sure because prior review and
 
04:18:26.510 --> 04:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation are completely different
 
04:18:29.750 --> 04:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
than review and approve and and I want
 
04:18:31.490 --> 04:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
to make make sure that there's no
 
04:18:34.849 --> 04:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:34.859 --> 04:18:37.389 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:18:37.389 --> 04:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:40.130 --> 04:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
that the oversight committee would be
 
04:18:43.729 --> 04:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
would be seeding some sort of
 
04:18:46.910 --> 04:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
um responsibility that a statutory
 
04:18:51.290 --> 04:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:53.990 --> 04:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm so in terms of Roman numeral 17
 
04:18:55.790 --> 04:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
when we talked about academic standards
 
04:18:57.469 --> 04:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
so that review and recommendation is
 
04:18:59.809 --> 04:18:59.819 align:start position:0%
relative to the academic standards which
 
04:19:02.210 --> 04:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
are the the larger standards documents
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
that like next Generation science
 
04:19:05.689 --> 04:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
standards Common Core
 
04:19:08.030 --> 04:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
um and then I think there may be some
 
04:19:09.050 --> 04:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
additional language somewhere else that
 
04:19:11.210 --> 04:19:11.220 align:start position:0%
also then refers to minimum standards so
 
04:19:12.889 --> 04:19:12.899 align:start position:0%
sometimes it may be a difference between
 
04:19:14.809 --> 04:19:14.819 align:start position:0%
what are the responsibilities of that
 
04:19:17.090 --> 04:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
oversight committee relative to minimum
 
04:19:19.010 --> 04:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
standards or academic standards or which
 
04:19:20.809 --> 04:19:20.819 align:start position:0%
particular standards are we talking
 
04:19:22.910 --> 04:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
about too right right and I think and
 
04:19:25.070 --> 04:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
and you know my understanding is that
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
the academic standards aren't just
 
04:19:30.590 --> 04:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
um you know revised social studies
 
04:19:33.050 --> 04:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
curriculum or revised you know science
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
standards but um
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
but tied into the statute
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
um the academic standards and
 
04:19:43.920 --> 04:19:45.410 align:start position:0%
um the academic standards and
and

04:19:45.410 --> 04:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:47.990 --> 04:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
and I guess I I would defer to the chair
 
04:19:52.570 --> 04:19:52.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:56.269 --> 04:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
you know the the position that the that
 
04:20:00.050 --> 04:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
the law takes on what the um uh what the
 
04:20:02.330 --> 04:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
oversight committee's responsibility is
 
04:20:05.570 --> 04:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
when it comes to uh to minimum standards
 
04:20:07.849 --> 04:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
and academic standards I know uh chair
 
04:20:09.710 --> 04:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
Ladd and I have had several
 
04:20:15.170 --> 04:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:18.349 --> 04:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
well on that note though if I may
 
04:20:21.889 --> 04:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
why is why is that one uh wise paragraph
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:33.170 --> 04:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:38.689 --> 04:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:41.570 --> 04:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
so we had moved the definition of
 
04:20:43.250 --> 04:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
academic standards to the front of that
 
04:20:45.410 --> 04:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
section so now when you read it it
 
04:20:47.510 --> 04:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
should have that definition academic
 
04:20:48.530 --> 04:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
standards at the beginning of the
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
section as opposed to referring to the
 
04:20:53.450 --> 04:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
particular statutory reference that was
 
04:20:55.250 --> 04:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
there before we just moved all the
 
04:20:56.510 --> 04:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
definitions to the front of the section
 
04:20:58.610 --> 04:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
this was a problem we found throughout
 
04:21:00.050 --> 04:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
this legislation there was Randomness
 
04:21:01.550 --> 04:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
definitions just not in definition
 
04:21:03.469 --> 04:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
sections and then it was referred to so
 
04:21:05.030 --> 04:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
we tried to put them all in the same
 
04:21:05.040 --> 04:21:08.210 align:start position:0%
we tried to put them all in the same
place

04:21:08.210 --> 04:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:08.220 --> 04:21:33.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:21:33.010 --> 04:21:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:35.210 --> 04:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
where where is the connection I guess
 
04:21:38.510 --> 04:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
between academic standards as you've got
 
04:21:44.090 --> 04:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
it defined in um in row and
 
04:21:46.670 --> 04:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
e2a Roman six
 
04:21:46.680 --> 04:21:48.170 align:start position:0%
e2a Roman six
and

04:21:48.170 --> 04:21:48.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:51.250 --> 04:21:51.260 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities that the committee
 
04:21:55.189 --> 04:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:58.670 --> 04:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
under 190 so this this would be
 
04:21:58.680 --> 04:22:00.530 align:start position:0%
under 190 so this this would be
um

04:22:00.530 --> 04:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:03.530 --> 04:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
performance targets required under 193
 
04:22:07.130 --> 04:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
H2 and I think the committee has a lot
 
04:22:11.389 --> 04:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:13.550 --> 04:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
so there are there are three places that
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
provide I think three distinct levels of
 
04:22:15.359 --> 04:22:16.670 align:start position:0%
provide I think three distinct levels of
oversight

04:22:16.670 --> 04:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
04:22:18.650 --> 04:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
um two of them specifically call out the
 
04:22:21.170 --> 04:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
oversight committee so in the oversight
 
04:22:23.210 --> 04:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
committee section
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
um they have the authority to I believe
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
review and approve the performance
 
04:22:29.210 --> 04:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
targets and the performance targets are
 
04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
all the targets that are written into
 
04:22:34.010 --> 04:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
the Essa estate plan so back in 1718
 
04:22:36.590 --> 04:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
when we first drafted that that was when
 
04:22:38.330 --> 04:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
we set all of those performance targets
 
04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
where we wanted schools to be
 
04:22:42.950 --> 04:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
um we had interim benchmarks we had
 
04:22:44.809 --> 04:22:44.819 align:start position:0%
long-term targets and and so that's what
 
04:22:46.429 --> 04:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
that's referring to there specifically
 
04:22:49.370 --> 04:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
performance targets in Roman numeral 17
 
04:22:51.769 --> 04:22:51.779 align:start position:0%
here this talks about the academic
 
04:22:53.990 --> 04:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
standards and that the oversight
 
04:22:55.250 --> 04:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
committee shall have prior review and
 
04:22:57.290 --> 04:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
recommendation of those those are the
 
04:22:58.490 --> 04:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
standards we use to build the state
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
assessment so again back in you know
 
04:23:03.410 --> 04:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
1617 we did that for the science test
 
04:23:05.389 --> 04:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
for the science standards it was a
 
04:23:06.650 --> 04:23:06.660 align:start position:0%
couple years before that we did it with
 
04:23:08.689 --> 04:23:08.699 align:start position:0%
the English and math standards
 
04:23:11.150 --> 04:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
specific to minimum standards
 
04:23:12.650 --> 04:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna go to the law book yeah
 
04:23:17.330 --> 04:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
page 550 is 193 E2
 
04:23:17.340 --> 04:23:19.010 align:start position:0%
page 550 is 193 E2
a

04:23:19.010 --> 04:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:23:21.849 --> 04:23:21.859 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral
 
04:23:24.729 --> 04:23:24.739 align:start position:0%
4 B
 
04:23:27.650 --> 04:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
and this one refers to the legislative
 
04:23:29.349 --> 04:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
oversight over the minimum standards
 
04:23:31.490 --> 04:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
neither the Department of Education nor
 
04:23:33.650 --> 04:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
the State Board shall by Statute or rule
 
04:23:35.330 --> 04:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
require oh I'm going to skip down a
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
little bit where is it uh sorry letter C
 
04:23:39.650 --> 04:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
the State Board shall not amend any
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
existing academic standards shall not
 
04:23:42.769 --> 04:23:42.779 align:start position:0%
approve any new academic standards
 
04:23:43.910 --> 04:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
rather prior review and recommendation
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
of legislative oversight committee
 
04:23:47.570 --> 04:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
established in RSA 183 c8a so there's
 
04:23:47.580 --> 04:23:48.889 align:start position:0%
established in RSA 183 c8a so there's
that

04:23:48.889 --> 04:23:48.899 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:23:52.849 --> 04:23:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:55.010 --> 04:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
um sorry the top of page 50. oh oh c
 
04:23:57.530 --> 04:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
you're on c yeah so that's that's this
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
new Roman numeral 17. yeah but if you go
 
04:24:02.689 --> 04:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
down a little bit further
 
04:24:02.699 --> 04:24:08.030 align:start position:0%
down a little bit further
um

04:24:08.030 --> 04:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:12.050 --> 04:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:14.330 --> 04:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
which ones you're looking for now
 
04:24:16.189 --> 04:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
so there's one that requires the
 
04:24:18.530 --> 04:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
approval of the general court
 
04:24:20.030 --> 04:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
and that one's relative to minimum
 
04:24:20.040 --> 04:24:21.290 align:start position:0%
and that one's relative to minimum
standards

04:24:21.290 --> 04:24:21.300 align:start position:0%
standards
 
04:24:22.610 --> 04:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
I thought I'd have been right in that
 
04:24:22.620 --> 04:24:24.670 align:start position:0%
I thought I'd have been right in that
section

04:24:24.670 --> 04:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:24:27.530 --> 04:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
the concern that I have is that we've
 
04:24:30.170 --> 04:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
got academic standards means what a
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
student should know and be able to do
 
04:24:35.689 --> 04:24:35.699 align:start position:0%
and of course or at each grade level
 
04:24:38.090 --> 04:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
and and I think that may have been
 
04:24:39.650 --> 04:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
changed earlier to eliminate the
 
04:24:42.830 --> 04:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
Intercourse so it's it's in the the
 
04:24:44.809 --> 04:24:44.819 align:start position:0%
paragraph prior to that so at the bottom
 
04:24:48.650 --> 04:24:48.660 align:start position:0%
of page 549 Roman numeral four
 
04:24:50.809 --> 04:24:50.819 align:start position:0%
this one now refers specifically to the
 
04:24:52.610 --> 04:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and the Court's
 
04:24:58.790 --> 04:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:01.370 --> 04:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
so academic standards are the ones that
 
04:25:03.410 --> 04:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
we use for the assessment and the
 
04:25:05.450 --> 04:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
oversight committee has review and
 
04:25:07.250 --> 04:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
approval Authority there
 
04:25:09.170 --> 04:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
in paragraph four the minimum standards
 
04:25:10.429 --> 04:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
talks about approval by the general
 
04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
court and that's the paragraph prior to
 
04:25:14.750 --> 04:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
the academic center so it exists
 
04:25:16.729 --> 04:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
independently in two sections right
 
04:25:18.769 --> 04:25:18.779 align:start position:0%
right yeah but I guess what I'm getting
 
04:25:18.779 --> 04:25:19.670 align:start position:0%
right yeah but I guess what I'm getting
at

04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:25:19.680 --> 04:25:20.349 align:start position:0%
at
um

04:25:20.349 --> 04:25:20.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:23.809 --> 04:25:23.819 align:start position:0%
Nate is that in in the definition of
 
04:25:25.969 --> 04:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
academic standards you're talking about
 
04:25:28.130 --> 04:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
what a student should know and be able
 
04:25:31.910 --> 04:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
to do and and then in the um in the
 
04:25:35.150 --> 04:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
oversight committee's charge it says
 
04:25:37.849 --> 04:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
review and approve Statewide performance
 
04:25:40.490 --> 04:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
targets which
 
04:25:40.500 --> 04:25:41.809 align:start position:0%
targets which
um

04:25:41.809 --> 04:25:41.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:44.450 --> 04:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
I I would think are related to what a
 
04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
student should know and be able to do
 
04:25:50.090 --> 04:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
um so I you know I I don't think there's
 
04:25:53.090 --> 04:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
necessarily a clean separation
 
04:25:55.729 --> 04:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
um uh between what the responsibilities
 
04:25:58.210 --> 04:25:58.220 align:start position:0%
of the of the oversight committee are
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
and it's Authority in um you know
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
in the area of academic standards
 
04:26:08.159 --> 04:26:09.250 align:start position:0%
in the area of academic standards
um

04:26:09.250 --> 04:26:09.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:12.110 --> 04:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
and so so that's the concern I've got
 
04:26:15.710 --> 04:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
over Romans 17 is that uh it's saying
 
04:26:17.389 --> 04:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
the State Board shall not amend any
 
04:26:19.309 --> 04:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
existing academic standards and shall
 
04:26:21.290 --> 04:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
not approve any new economic standards
 
04:26:23.750 --> 04:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
without the review and recommendation of
 
04:26:25.729 --> 04:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee
 
04:26:27.889 --> 04:26:27.899 align:start position:0%
um I I think the oversight committee
 
04:26:29.809 --> 04:26:29.819 align:start position:0%
might have greater
 
04:26:29.819 --> 04:26:30.590 align:start position:0%
might have greater
um

04:26:30.590 --> 04:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:33.610 --> 04:26:33.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:36.170 --> 04:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
greater Authority down the review and
 
04:26:36.180 --> 04:26:37.370 align:start position:0%
greater Authority down the review and
approval

04:26:37.370 --> 04:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
approval
 
04:26:37.380 --> 04:26:39.229 align:start position:0%
approval
um

04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:41.210 --> 04:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
and so we haven't so that's current
 
04:26:42.830 --> 04:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
statute we haven't changed that yeah
 
04:26:45.349 --> 04:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
yeah no I well it's moved around but
 
04:26:50.450 --> 04:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:03.469 --> 04:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:03.479 --> 04:27:09.469 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:27:09.469 --> 04:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:11.870 --> 04:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
well this isn't an area where we have to
 
04:27:14.570 --> 04:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
be very careful yeah yeah very very
 
04:27:17.630 --> 04:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
careful we lost this a year ago
 
04:27:20.750 --> 04:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
and we got to put back in
 
04:27:23.389 --> 04:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
and we had North or the a year ago it
 
04:27:25.250 --> 04:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
was all gone it stripped
 
04:27:28.070 --> 04:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
that the whole law was deleted
 
04:27:30.649 --> 04:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
right for the for the oversight for the
 
04:27:33.170 --> 04:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
oversight yeah so our belief is that
 
04:27:35.510 --> 04:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't change your oversight
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
ability at all or well if you're other
 
04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
committees oversight committee we
 
04:27:41.330 --> 04:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
believe that this keeps everything
 
04:27:43.969 --> 04:27:43.979 align:start position:0%
exactly the same the only differences
 
04:27:49.670 --> 04:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:57.110 --> 04:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:06.469 --> 04:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:10.910 --> 04:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
are you seeing a difference it I guess
 
04:28:13.189 --> 04:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative luno um
 
04:28:15.769 --> 04:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
well I mean the the the fact that we're
 
04:28:17.570 --> 04:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're moving it I think
 
04:28:22.790 --> 04:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
opens up the uh the the door to uh to
 
04:28:25.010 --> 04:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
how it could be interpreted because it's
 
04:28:28.929 --> 04:28:28.939 align:start position:0%
it it you know when when when when
 
04:28:32.689 --> 04:28:32.699 align:start position:0%
current law has basically evolved over I
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
don't know how many you know countless
 
04:28:36.889 --> 04:28:36.899 align:start position:0%
years a little bit here a little bit
 
04:28:38.769 --> 04:28:38.779 align:start position:0%
here and a little bit here and now we're
 
04:28:41.149 --> 04:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
re-codifying you're you're you're you're
 
04:28:44.210 --> 04:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
essentially taking a now we're putting
 
04:28:46.490 --> 04:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
this into law and we all agree this is
 
04:28:48.769 --> 04:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
this is how it is as opposed to
 
04:28:50.149 --> 04:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
something that developed and may have
 
04:28:52.250 --> 04:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
had some irregularities and may have had
 
04:28:54.530 --> 04:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
some conflicts in it
 
04:28:56.389 --> 04:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
um now when we put it in we're we're
 
04:29:01.550 --> 04:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
doing it in in in you know Eyes Wide
 
04:29:06.710 --> 04:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
Open that that um to the Confluence and
 
04:29:10.130 --> 04:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
I think where when when we when we do a
 
04:29:13.189 --> 04:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
recodification uh like the state has
 
04:29:15.469 --> 04:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
done recently with the trust laws and
 
04:29:18.530 --> 04:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
and lot and some other areas that um
 
04:29:20.510 --> 04:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
that it's the opportunity not just to
 
04:29:23.090 --> 04:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
move stuff around and renumber them but
 
04:29:26.510 --> 04:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
to uh to to address policy where there
 
04:29:28.729 --> 04:29:28.739 align:start position:0%
where may have been either incomplete
 
04:29:31.969 --> 04:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
inconsistent or in Conflict okay and
 
04:29:33.710 --> 04:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
that makes sense I just that was not the
 
04:29:35.929 --> 04:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
intention of intention of us to move to
 
04:29:37.610 --> 04:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
do other than anything but other than
 
04:29:38.809 --> 04:29:38.819 align:start position:0%
put it someplace where I made more sense
 
04:29:40.370 --> 04:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
right I mean because when we read it
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
about the oversight committee and even
 
04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
we've been working with oversight
 
04:29:44.210 --> 04:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
committee because that's Nate and I that
 
04:29:46.010 --> 04:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
do that work as well like this is not
 
04:29:47.570 --> 04:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
really just about assessment it's about
 
04:29:50.750 --> 04:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
a much broader oversight of State
 
04:29:50.760 --> 04:29:52.370 align:start position:0%
a much broader oversight of State
accountability

04:29:52.370 --> 04:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
04:29:53.929 --> 04:29:53.939 align:start position:0%
specifically around an adequate
 
04:29:55.790 --> 04:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
education and that's why we have felt it
 
04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
belonged in this session rather than
 
04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
just the assessment section the
 
04:30:01.790 --> 04:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
assessment section is obviously used for
 
04:30:03.769 --> 04:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
the measurement as part of the
 
04:30:05.929 --> 04:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
measurement of an adequate education but
 
04:30:08.330 --> 04:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
this this oversight Community felt was
 
04:30:10.250 --> 04:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
was broader
 
04:30:12.530 --> 04:30:12.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I and I agree with you I think it I
 
04:30:16.429 --> 04:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
think it is broader and um and and maybe
 
04:30:18.590 --> 04:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
because of that prior review and
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation isn't really applicable
 
04:30:23.929 --> 04:30:23.939 align:start position:0%
uh anymore but but maybe the terms
 
04:30:26.809 --> 04:30:26.819 align:start position:0%
review and approve are are more more
 
04:30:29.210 --> 04:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
applicable because you know if if the
 
04:30:32.330 --> 04:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
oversight committee has has uh review
 
04:30:35.510 --> 04:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
and approve of performance targets but
 
04:30:37.670 --> 04:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
but minimum standards and academic
 
04:30:40.130 --> 04:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
standards are somehow moving around I
 
04:30:41.570 --> 04:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
don't know how I don't know how the
 
04:30:43.070 --> 04:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
oversight committee does performance
 
04:30:45.649 --> 04:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
targets if other standards can be moved
 
04:30:48.769 --> 04:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
around out outside of the uh the
 
04:30:50.389 --> 04:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
committee's um
 
04:30:55.010 --> 04:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:55.020 --> 04:31:03.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:31:03.490 --> 04:31:03.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:05.570 --> 04:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
too too much about it I know the last
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
time we were here
 
04:31:08.090 --> 04:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
um we kind of gave just a very brief
 
04:31:10.490 --> 04:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
sort of you know our intention really
 
04:31:12.110 --> 04:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
was to do as much cleanup as we could
 
04:31:14.330 --> 04:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
with this and we recognize as well there
 
04:31:16.070 --> 04:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
are things that we would love to either
 
04:31:18.590 --> 04:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
make better or more efficient that would
 
04:31:20.210 --> 04:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
represent a more substantive policy
 
04:31:22.250 --> 04:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
change for some of the work that we do
 
04:31:23.450 --> 04:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
um and we sort of see it as like the
 
04:31:25.550 --> 04:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
next step is we're trying to sort of get
 
04:31:27.469 --> 04:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
the law back into a good place now with
 
04:31:29.149 --> 04:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
how we currently operate in the field
 
04:31:31.250 --> 04:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
and then let's take that next step of
 
04:31:33.410 --> 04:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
really digging into it and saying okay
 
04:31:35.149 --> 04:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
so what what can we do to improve
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
schools and students and adequate
 
04:31:39.170 --> 04:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
education from a more policy perspective
 
04:31:44.210 --> 04:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:44.220 --> 04:31:46.250 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

04:31:46.250 --> 04:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
04:31:48.830 --> 04:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
okay let's let's move on well let me
 
04:31:52.729 --> 04:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
just ask this one just uh the reason for
 
04:31:55.370 --> 04:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
the elimination of the public school
 
04:31:55.380 --> 04:31:57.969 align:start position:0%
the elimination of the public school
approval

04:31:57.969 --> 04:31:57.979 align:start position:0%
approval
 
04:32:01.969 --> 04:32:01.979 align:start position:0%
in paragraph old four
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
in the paragraph new uh 18 giving you've
 
04:32:08.990 --> 04:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
eliminated for public school approval I
 
04:32:11.269 --> 04:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
just what was the basis for the removal
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
of that language because we're just
 
04:32:14.149 --> 04:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
using that minimum standard that we
 
04:32:18.769 --> 04:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
defined back in page 12.
 
04:32:21.649 --> 04:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
um 14. we have minimum standards to find
 
04:32:22.969 --> 04:32:22.979 align:start position:0%
now it's a minimum standards means
 
04:32:24.050 --> 04:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
04:32:24.060 --> 04:32:26.570 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
approval

04:32:26.570 --> 04:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.849 --> 04:32:28.859 align:start position:0%
so we actually gave it that definition
 
04:32:30.290 --> 04:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
and are using it throughout this
 
04:32:30.300 --> 04:32:38.530 align:start position:0%
and are using it throughout this
consistently

04:32:38.530 --> 04:32:38.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:41.630 --> 04:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
further on that page
 
04:32:45.410 --> 04:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
okay let's go to page 21.
 
04:32:47.809 --> 04:32:47.819 align:start position:0%
I just text her we're not resolving
 
04:32:52.570 --> 04:32:52.580 align:start position:0%
everything today no no no we're
 
04:32:58.250 --> 04:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:58.260 --> 04:33:09.289 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:33:09.289 --> 04:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:21.949 --> 04:33:21.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:22.970 --> 04:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
suspension he just said she's gonna
 
04:33:24.830 --> 04:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
bring them to the ground
 
04:33:28.910 --> 04:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Jim yeah I'm asking if maybe it would
 
04:33:31.849 --> 04:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
clarify some of our discussion if we
 
04:33:35.869 --> 04:33:35.879 align:start position:0%
made a small amendment in terminology
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
when we're talking as in this section
 
04:33:39.590 --> 04:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
here section
 
04:33:39.600 --> 04:33:40.910 align:start position:0%
here section
uh

04:33:40.910 --> 04:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:43.131 --> 04:33:43.141 align:start position:0%
six I believe it is
 
04:33:43.141 --> 04:33:44.029 align:start position:0%
six I believe it is
um

04:33:44.029 --> 04:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:46.131 --> 04:33:46.141 align:start position:0%
minimum standard for public school
 
04:33:46.141 --> 04:33:47.390 align:start position:0%
minimum standard for public school
approval

04:33:47.390 --> 04:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
approval
 
04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
what if we called it minimum
 
04:33:52.490 --> 04:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
programmatic standards
 
04:33:55.310 --> 04:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
program standards yourself so the
 
04:33:56.330 --> 04:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
minimum Center for Public School
 
04:33:59.029 --> 04:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
approval um is throughout Rule and and
 
04:34:01.810 --> 04:34:01.820 align:start position:0%
it is a very specific connotation
 
04:34:04.131 --> 04:34:04.141 align:start position:0%
the minimum standard for public school
 
04:34:05.929 --> 04:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
approval has a very specific connotation
 
04:34:07.910 --> 04:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
at the section of rule that's approved
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about the minimum
 
04:34:10.490 --> 04:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
standards for public school we wouldn't
 
04:34:11.631 --> 04:34:11.641 align:start position:0%
want to start messing with that
 
04:34:11.641 --> 04:34:13.369 align:start position:0%
want to start messing with that
definition

04:34:13.369 --> 04:34:13.379 align:start position:0%
definition
 
04:34:14.750 --> 04:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and that's why we tried to kind of
 
04:34:16.849 --> 04:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
use two different delineations here when
 
04:34:18.109 --> 04:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the minimum standard
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
from public school approval versus the
 
04:34:22.429 --> 04:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
content of an adequate education but
 
04:34:24.051 --> 04:34:24.061 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about that that is
 
04:34:25.849 --> 04:34:25.859 align:start position:0%
rules that are adopted by the state
 
04:34:27.650 --> 04:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
board right now and we wouldn't want to
 
04:34:27.660 --> 04:34:28.490 align:start position:0%
board right now and we wouldn't want to
change

04:34:28.490 --> 04:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:34:29.570 --> 04:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
um I just don't do want to point out
 
04:34:31.490 --> 04:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
here so all of these definitions are
 
04:34:33.650 --> 04:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
Incorporated back on page 12 on the
 
04:34:35.390 --> 04:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
definition section so that's all we're
 
04:34:39.170 --> 04:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:41.631 --> 04:34:41.641 align:start position:0%
One Way lastly list thank you very much
 
04:34:44.330 --> 04:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
I didn't understand that
 
04:34:47.090 --> 04:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
um when we list all the areas where the
 
04:34:50.150 --> 04:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
English language arts etc etc
 
04:34:53.330 --> 04:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
we don't distinguish between which is
 
04:34:55.609 --> 04:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
the second language we don't consider
 
04:34:58.250 --> 04:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
English for speakers of other Esau
 
04:35:00.551 --> 04:35:00.561 align:start position:0%
speakers of other languages we don't
 
04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
leave that for the schools to decide
 
04:35:06.529 --> 04:35:06.539 align:start position:0%
so it's two separate programs yeah so
 
04:35:08.631 --> 04:35:08.641 align:start position:0%
when we talk about uh English language
 
04:35:10.490 --> 04:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
arts here it's an English language arts
 
04:35:15.170 --> 04:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
program for all students title III for
 
04:35:17.209 --> 04:35:17.219 align:start position:0%
English language Learners tends to be a
 
04:35:18.650 --> 04:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
separate program in schools has a
 
04:35:19.849 --> 04:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
different set of standards and
 
04:35:21.769 --> 04:35:21.779 align:start position:0%
assessments that we use and it works
 
04:35:24.051 --> 04:35:24.061 align:start position:0%
simultaneously to our regular English
 
04:35:25.670 --> 04:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
language arts program
 
04:35:27.109 --> 04:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
so they're two separate programs
 
04:35:30.650 --> 04:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
essentially okay but the word standards
 
04:35:33.349 --> 04:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
creates us a linguistic problem because
 
04:35:35.689 --> 04:35:35.699 align:start position:0%
standards say you know what is the
 
04:35:37.910 --> 04:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
standard ABC whatever you've got
 
04:35:40.609 --> 04:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
something measurable and then what we're
 
04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
talking about here is programs and we're
 
04:35:46.269 --> 04:35:46.279 align:start position:0%
saying okay we decided we
 
04:35:49.369 --> 04:35:49.379 align:start position:0%
beat the center if we have a program
 
04:35:51.709 --> 04:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
but does the program meet the standard
 
04:35:54.709 --> 04:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
needed to solve this also my problem my
 
04:35:57.470 --> 04:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
concern and and we are not doing a
 
04:35:59.090 --> 04:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
program approval here we are talking
 
04:36:01.789 --> 04:36:01.799 align:start position:0%
specifically about standards I
 
04:36:04.010 --> 04:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
understand we're trying to talk about
 
04:36:06.349 --> 04:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
those as though there are no standards
 
04:36:06.359 --> 04:36:07.609 align:start position:0%
those as though there are no standards
elsewhere

04:36:07.609 --> 04:36:07.619 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
04:36:10.159 --> 04:36:10.169 align:start position:0%
you see what the word standards
 
04:36:10.169 --> 04:36:12.170 align:start position:0%
you see what the word standards
[Music]

04:36:12.170 --> 04:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:36:14.390 --> 04:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
we've had all kinds of standards in the
 
04:36:16.010 --> 04:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
past we try to we had the education
 
04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
standards at one time and nobody knew
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
what that meant we had academic
 
04:36:21.769 --> 04:36:21.779 align:start position:0%
standards minimum standards you know
 
04:36:24.470 --> 04:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
it's I think we gotta start boiling it
 
04:36:27.289 --> 04:36:27.299 align:start position:0%
down oh and we completely agree uh it's
 
04:36:29.990 --> 04:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
and we're using everything in different
 
04:36:31.849 --> 04:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
ways and we're confused it's hard for us
 
04:36:33.890 --> 04:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
to explain things to the schools so and
 
04:36:35.929 --> 04:36:35.939 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to do a lot
 
04:36:37.789 --> 04:36:37.799 align:start position:0%
throughout this document
 
04:36:37.799 --> 04:36:38.449 align:start position:0%
throughout this document
um

04:36:38.449 --> 04:36:38.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:41.150 --> 04:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
and we just need to be better we us I
 
04:36:43.730 --> 04:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
mean even things like we just don't use
 
04:36:45.410 --> 04:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
consistent terminology throughout this
 
04:36:46.670 --> 04:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
law book and it's something that we
 
04:36:48.709 --> 04:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely need to do and the thing is
 
04:36:50.929 --> 04:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
very frequently completed public school
 
04:36:52.970 --> 04:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
or sorry non-public school and private
 
04:36:55.131 --> 04:36:55.141 align:start position:0%
school those are like inflated but we
 
04:36:56.269 --> 04:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
don't have a definition of private
 
04:36:57.650 --> 04:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
school so then you write it a law it
 
04:36:59.090 --> 04:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
says private school we don't necessarily
 
04:37:01.670 --> 04:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
know what that is so
 
04:37:01.680 --> 04:37:03.349 align:start position:0%
know what that is so
yeah

04:37:03.349 --> 04:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:37:07.369 --> 04:37:07.379 align:start position:0%
okay page 22.
 
04:37:10.189 --> 04:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
yes just a question that makes me wonder
 
04:37:12.410 --> 04:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
this list um
 
04:37:14.810 --> 04:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
of definitions we've talked today about
 
04:37:14.820 --> 04:37:15.949 align:start position:0%
of definitions we've talked today about
two

04:37:15.949 --> 04:37:15.959 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:37:19.730 --> 04:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
uses of minimum standards one for public
 
04:37:22.910 --> 04:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
school approval and one that describes
 
04:37:25.551 --> 04:37:25.561 align:start position:0%
adequate education correct correct
 
04:37:28.310 --> 04:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
though I know one is built from the
 
04:37:28.320 --> 04:37:29.510 align:start position:0%
though I know one is built from the
other

04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:37:32.209 --> 04:37:32.219 align:start position:0%
but just I mean if you think it makes
 
04:37:34.369 --> 04:37:34.379 align:start position:0%
sense because it didn't dawn on me till
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
today that minimum standards that we
 
04:37:38.990 --> 04:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
talk about for an adequate education is
 
04:37:39.000 --> 04:37:40.189 align:start position:0%
talk about for an adequate education is
different

04:37:40.189 --> 04:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:37:42.470 --> 04:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
to some extent with minimum standards
 
04:37:44.631 --> 04:37:44.641 align:start position:0%
for public school approval whether that
 
04:37:47.330 --> 04:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
definition of minimum standards to meet
 
04:37:47.340 --> 04:37:49.310 align:start position:0%
definition of minimum standards to meet
adequacy

04:37:49.310 --> 04:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
should be added there or not I think
 
04:37:53.150 --> 04:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
that's why we're going to use the word
 
04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
criteria for an adequate education
 
04:37:57.051 --> 04:37:57.061 align:start position:0%
rather than right whatever the term is
 
04:37:59.330 --> 04:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
so that it's consistent with the law but
 
04:38:01.070 --> 04:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
I think it would make sense to break it
 
04:38:01.080 --> 04:38:02.750 align:start position:0%
I think it would make sense to break it
out

04:38:02.750 --> 04:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:38:05.269 --> 04:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
just because they are two different
 
04:38:08.929 --> 04:38:08.939 align:start position:0%
entities not for me to decide you no
 
04:38:11.150 --> 04:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
we're in real but we've talked about it
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
in two meanings and I'm thinking well
 
04:38:16.551 --> 04:38:16.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:16.561 --> 04:38:21.769 align:start position:0%
 
correct

04:38:21.769 --> 04:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:24.170 --> 04:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
right but it should probably be included
 
04:38:27.170 --> 04:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
in this list of definitions well so
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
we've can on 22 we've completely struck
 
04:38:30.349 --> 04:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
out this last but there's some
 
04:38:31.849 --> 04:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
definitions and we've just referred back
 
04:38:34.670 --> 04:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
to the list of definitions on page yeah
 
04:38:36.769 --> 04:38:36.779 align:start position:0%
it just begins on page 17 now
 
04:38:38.330 --> 04:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
so it's not listed two separate times
 
04:38:40.010 --> 04:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
because this is another area that it was
 
04:38:42.590 --> 04:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
listed twice mostly the same but very
 
04:38:48.070 --> 04:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:51.051 --> 04:38:51.061 align:start position:0%
if I'm reading this correctly that
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
you've made a change I'm looking at the
 
04:38:57.349 --> 04:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
first section under the
 
04:39:00.170 --> 04:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
the second section where you it seems to
 
04:39:02.590 --> 04:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
be that if the school was to demonstrate
 
04:39:04.910 --> 04:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
and now you're talking about the
 
04:39:04.920 --> 04:39:06.170 align:start position:0%
and now you're talking about the
department

04:39:06.170 --> 04:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
uh why why the change so so previously
 
04:39:13.010 --> 04:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
so it said that schools will demonstrate
 
04:39:14.750 --> 04:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
but the department has to implement the
 
04:39:16.250 --> 04:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
accountability system we're the ones
 
04:39:17.869 --> 04:39:17.879 align:start position:0%
that are doing implementing the
 
04:39:19.789 --> 04:39:19.799 align:start position:0%
assessment we're the ones that are going
 
04:39:22.250 --> 04:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
to take all the school scores aggregate
 
04:39:24.769 --> 04:39:24.779 align:start position:0%
those together rank all of the schools
 
04:39:26.689 --> 04:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
were there ones that are gonna
 
04:39:29.090 --> 04:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
implement the ibass and ask the schools
 
04:39:30.529 --> 04:39:30.539 align:start position:0%
to fill it out so that's why the
 
04:39:32.269 --> 04:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
department is going to implement the
 
04:39:33.949 --> 04:39:33.959 align:start position:0%
systems and the schools are going to
 
04:39:35.150 --> 04:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they're providing
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
adequate education through those systems
 
04:39:39.050 --> 04:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
that the department is implementing so
 
04:39:40.610 --> 04:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
those are really department so those
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
systems themselves are a Statewide
 
04:39:45.708 --> 04:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
system so a school can't Implement a
 
04:39:47.390 --> 04:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide assistant the department has
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
to do that and the school participates
 
04:39:51.170 --> 04:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
in a small piece of it which becomes a
 
04:39:53.510 --> 04:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide accountability system thank
 
04:39:53.520 --> 04:39:56.270 align:start position:0%
Statewide accountability system thank
you

04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:58.130 --> 04:39:58.140 align:start position:0%
are those rules adopted by the State
 
04:40:00.850 --> 04:40:00.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:10.610 --> 04:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:10.620 --> 04:40:12.368 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:40:12.368 --> 04:40:12.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:15.708 --> 04:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
I'll set 14 rules right here
 
04:40:19.788 --> 04:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
so Ouija um we we got rid of that in the
 
04:40:21.530 --> 04:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
rule reference and just referred back to
 
04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
page 12 the list again page 12 or 17. uh
 
04:40:28.610 --> 04:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
17 yeah 12 is definitions that was one
 
04:40:30.050 --> 04:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
of the places where the list existed in
 
04:40:34.250 --> 04:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay so on on page 22 Rick uh
 
04:40:43.250 --> 04:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
what what are we referring to by
 
04:40:46.310 --> 04:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
requirements of paragraphs one and two
 
04:40:48.490 --> 04:40:48.500 align:start position:0%
so that's the next set it's page 23
 
04:40:51.170 --> 04:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
you'll see paragraph one
 
04:40:54.350 --> 04:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
and that's the ibass system oh okay and
 
04:40:57.230 --> 04:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
Page 24 starts paragraph two and that's
 
04:40:57.240 --> 04:40:59.090 align:start position:0%
Page 24 starts paragraph two and that's
pbas

04:40:59.090 --> 04:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
pbas
 
04:41:01.788 --> 04:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
okay and um before I get down to
 
04:41:05.030 --> 04:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
questions on that then and and this is
 
04:41:09.288 --> 04:41:09.298 align:start position:0%
in a new section 193 e colon 4.
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so these sections traditionally had
 
04:41:14.990 --> 04:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
lived within 183h previously
 
04:41:18.288 --> 04:41:18.298 align:start position:0%
um and half well half of it lived in 183
 
04:41:20.750 --> 04:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
e half of it lived in 183h right and we
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
were running into problems where people
 
04:41:24.288 --> 04:41:24.298 align:start position:0%
would read 193e and think that was the
 
04:41:26.030 --> 04:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
whole accountability system and not
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
realize there was the other half an h
 
04:41:30.590 --> 04:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
and vice versa people look at H and not
 
04:41:32.690 --> 04:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
realize the first half was an e so this
 
04:41:34.310 --> 04:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
was our attempt to take the two halves
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
ibass and P bass and put them into the
 
04:41:38.208 --> 04:41:38.218 align:start position:0%
same section of law so you could
 
04:41:40.430 --> 04:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
actually read them consecutively because
 
04:41:42.830 --> 04:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
you have to do both okay and so did the
 
04:41:44.510 --> 04:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
did the subsequent changes to the
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
oversight committee that we were talking
 
04:41:49.010 --> 04:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
about reflect the changes from H and E
 
04:41:51.590 --> 04:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
yes okay yeah so they have the same
 
04:41:53.628 --> 04:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
oversight and now the oversight of the
 
04:41:56.208 --> 04:41:56.218 align:start position:0%
system is all together in a single place
 
04:41:59.570 --> 04:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
okay okay and then what's happening to
 
04:42:04.510 --> 04:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:06.590 --> 04:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
I think that's the oversight committee
 
04:42:06.600 --> 04:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
I think that's the oversight committee
no

04:42:08.120 --> 04:42:08.130 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:42:08.130 --> 04:42:10.010 align:start position:0%
no
[Music]

04:42:10.010 --> 04:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:42:13.610 --> 04:42:13.620 align:start position:0%
I'm on page 562. I was at the unique
 
04:42:15.650 --> 04:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
people yeah identifiers we moved that to
 
04:42:17.628 --> 04:42:17.638 align:start position:0%
a new section okay yeah all right starts
 
04:42:21.230 --> 04:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:23.990 --> 04:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
and I mean that's a very very important
 
04:42:25.550 --> 04:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
section of law but it's not necessarily
 
04:42:27.050 --> 04:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
specific to an adequate education right
 
04:42:28.970 --> 04:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
it's it's more operational for the
 
04:42:30.470 --> 04:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
Department it's just another thing right
 
04:42:32.990 --> 04:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and who knows why it ended up
 
04:42:43.310 --> 04:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:53.110 --> 04:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
nice yes good good with questions
 
04:42:56.750 --> 04:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
sort of good questions why is knee s
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
breaking out uh credit accreditation
 
04:43:01.490 --> 04:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
taken out
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
so the ibass system looks to see if
 
04:43:06.050 --> 04:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
schools are compliant with that list of
 
04:43:09.230 --> 04:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
of 12 or 13 things in the content of an
 
04:43:11.270 --> 04:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
adequate education the ask accreditation
 
04:43:13.610 --> 04:43:13.620 align:start position:0%
is something entirely different there's
 
04:43:15.410 --> 04:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
a cost base to it so schools have to pay
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
for it so you we created a system by
 
04:43:20.448 --> 04:43:20.458 align:start position:0%
which we were requiring schools to
 
04:43:22.128 --> 04:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
demonstrate compliance with a set of
 
04:43:24.708 --> 04:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
statutes or they could instead of
 
04:43:26.448 --> 04:43:26.458 align:start position:0%
demonstrate a compliance do a niask
 
04:43:28.368 --> 04:43:28.378 align:start position:0%
accreditation which does not look at New
 
04:43:30.170 --> 04:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statutes and compliance so
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's not the same system and it created
 
04:43:34.430 --> 04:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
a situation where schools that had more
 
04:43:36.410 --> 04:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
resources could pay for the ask
 
04:43:38.690 --> 04:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
accreditation and do it which is a valid
 
04:43:41.570 --> 04:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
and rigorous accreditation process but
 
04:43:43.310 --> 04:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
it sort of got them out of ibass where
 
04:43:44.868 --> 04:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
the other schools were doing ibas and
 
04:43:47.090 --> 04:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
they just weren't equivalent systems so
 
04:43:50.090 --> 04:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
we were we there's a value to Nest
 
04:43:52.190 --> 04:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
accreditation schools can go through and
 
04:43:53.930 --> 04:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
do that on their own but there's no
 
04:43:55.850 --> 04:43:55.860 align:start position:0%
requirement that schools in the state do
 
04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
a knee ask specific accreditation it's
 
04:44:04.810 --> 04:44:04.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:04.820 --> 04:44:06.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:44:06.590 --> 04:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:09.310 --> 04:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
shall submit a narrative explanation
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
detailing how schools haven't compiled
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
each other we've taken that out too no
 
04:44:17.330 --> 04:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
so that that remained so that that is
 
04:44:19.070 --> 04:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
what ibas is so schools are required to
 
04:44:20.868 --> 04:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
submit a narrative response of how
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
they're meeting each of those areas
 
04:44:25.190 --> 04:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
identified in the content for an
 
04:44:26.570 --> 04:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
04:44:29.090 --> 04:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
in the previous system if a school was
 
04:44:30.350 --> 04:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
accredited through the ask they didn't
 
04:44:44.350 --> 04:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:46.490 --> 04:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
well the other thing there was
 
04:44:47.690 --> 04:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
differences in times when you asked
 
04:44:49.430 --> 04:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
accreditation I believe is every 10
 
04:44:51.288 --> 04:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
every 10 years whereas the ibass
 
04:44:53.690 --> 04:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
requirement was every two years so you
 
04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
so schools that weren't doing the ask
 
04:44:57.770 --> 04:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
had to do this every two years but if
 
04:44:59.208 --> 04:44:59.218 align:start position:0%
you went through and paid for neaska
 
04:45:01.250 --> 04:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
accreditation you could skip out on it
 
04:45:02.690 --> 04:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
for 10 years so there's there's another
 
04:45:05.390 --> 04:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
difference there haven't they changed
 
04:45:07.910 --> 04:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
that I thought they went to five they
 
04:45:10.250 --> 04:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
met I wasn't sure when I was in the
 
04:45:11.690 --> 04:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
school system they're still doing 10
 
04:45:14.628 --> 04:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
years but I I think there's some reports
 
04:45:18.830 --> 04:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
which I do now much sooner than that
 
04:45:21.410 --> 04:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
three yeah yeah I would have gone way
 
04:45:25.730 --> 04:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
down yeah well it's a it's an update
 
04:45:27.770 --> 04:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
with the highest rate of nothing you
 
04:45:29.690 --> 04:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
don't have to do that and and so we just
 
04:45:31.128 --> 04:45:31.138 align:start position:0%
what we wanted to be was we wanted to
 
04:45:32.810 --> 04:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
have the same set of measurement across
 
04:45:35.330 --> 04:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
all schools so I'm asked if I'm asking
 
04:45:38.750 --> 04:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
the ask or similar kind of work I think
 
04:45:40.610 --> 04:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
one replacing the other actually makes
 
04:45:43.550 --> 04:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
sense but because it is not at all it
 
04:45:45.070 --> 04:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to use them
 
04:45:47.510 --> 04:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
interchangeably and so we said let's use
 
04:45:49.850 --> 04:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
the same standards which is ibass and
 
04:45:51.890 --> 04:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
ibass I mean anybody who has completed
 
04:45:53.390 --> 04:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
it in the past specifically
 
04:45:55.310 --> 04:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden
 
04:45:57.708 --> 04:45:57.718 align:start position:0%
um knows the survey in the past was
 
04:46:00.650 --> 04:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
pages and pages and pages long and there
 
04:46:01.970 --> 04:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
was a lot of information that was in
 
04:46:04.010 --> 04:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
there that wasn't necessarily related to
 
04:46:05.628 --> 04:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
this area
 
04:46:07.250 --> 04:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
um and so what the department has done
 
04:46:08.990 --> 04:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
is we've gone through and we've said all
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
right let's make ibass truly what the
 
04:46:13.250 --> 04:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
law gives us the authority to implement
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
and not ask all of these other questions
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
um and pair that down that survey and it
 
04:46:21.170 --> 04:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
will anticipate it being a much
 
04:46:23.690 --> 04:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
easier ask on the schools to implement
 
04:46:25.970 --> 04:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
this new ibass system rather than go
 
04:46:28.850 --> 04:46:28.860 align:start position:0%
through the fullness which has nothing
 
04:46:31.368 --> 04:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
to do with an adequate education
 
04:46:33.890 --> 04:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
you know years ago that's what we did ni
 
04:46:36.830 --> 04:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
asked was how schools reported to
 
04:46:38.510 --> 04:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education right here in
 
04:46:38.520 --> 04:46:40.368 align:start position:0%
Department of Education right here in
Concord

04:46:40.368 --> 04:46:40.378 align:start position:0%
Concord
 
04:46:42.948 --> 04:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
um you know and of course I served on
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
the northwest Association schools and
 
04:46:46.610 --> 04:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
colleges and there's a lot to this when
 
04:46:49.070 --> 04:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
you're doing your self-evaluation you
 
04:46:51.470 --> 04:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
involve your parents your community the
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
students the staff everybody and it's a
 
04:46:57.590 --> 04:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's a healthy process in which you get
 
04:46:59.690 --> 04:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
in you look at what you're doing and
 
04:47:02.690 --> 04:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
then you invite a team to come in and do
 
04:47:05.230 --> 04:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
that evaluation of your product
 
04:47:08.090 --> 04:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
I cannot understand why we want to get
 
04:47:10.368 --> 04:47:10.378 align:start position:0%
rid of it I I we don't want to feel it's
 
04:47:12.350 --> 04:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
just another option all our high schools
 
04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
except maybe one or two are knee ask
 
04:47:14.638 --> 04:47:16.128 align:start position:0%
except maybe one or two are knee ask
approved

04:47:16.128 --> 04:47:16.138 align:start position:0%
approved
 
04:47:18.110 --> 04:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
so we and we don't want to get rid of it
 
04:47:20.330 --> 04:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
we would like schools to get well we
 
04:47:22.128 --> 04:47:22.138 align:start position:0%
like schools have the opportunity to go
 
04:47:24.050 --> 04:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
through and ask if they want it's just
 
04:47:25.550 --> 04:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
not a measurement of a school is
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
providing an adequate education or not
 
04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
as defined by the state law and that was
 
04:47:31.730 --> 04:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
our reasoning for getting rid of it
 
04:47:34.190 --> 04:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
when you have it all those folks I just
 
04:47:36.890 --> 04:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned contributing to it I think
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a even a better
 
04:47:39.890 --> 04:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
report than you're going to get out
 
04:47:42.770 --> 04:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
ibass well part of the problem is the
 
04:47:44.330 --> 04:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
questions aren't the same and the
 
04:47:45.890 --> 04:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
questions in ibas are directly related
 
04:47:48.350 --> 04:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
to the school approval minimum standards
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
they say are you compliant with these
 
04:47:52.368 --> 04:47:52.378 align:start position:0%
sections required in law niast doesn't
 
04:47:54.350 --> 04:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
ask that so niac is doing a very
 
04:47:56.750 --> 04:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
rigorous program evaluation of what the
 
04:47:58.430 --> 04:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
school is offering but if you haven't
 
04:48:00.350 --> 04:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
asked accreditation we don't know if
 
04:48:01.970 --> 04:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
that means you're compliant with the
 
04:48:03.708 --> 04:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
minimum standards or not it might mean
 
04:48:05.090 --> 04:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
you have a very rigorous Academic
 
04:48:05.100 --> 04:48:05.990 align:start position:0%
you have a very rigorous Academic
Program

04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
Program
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a different set of
 
04:48:10.610 --> 04:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
questions that doesn't say yes or no are
 
04:48:12.948 --> 04:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
you compliant with the content for an
 
04:48:14.868 --> 04:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
adequate education and that's what this
 
04:48:16.910 --> 04:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
section is supposed to do
 
04:48:20.448 --> 04:48:20.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:24.890 --> 04:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
we being the department or Nate no Us in
 
04:48:27.470 --> 04:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
case and so and we had discussions with
 
04:48:29.150 --> 04:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
the superintendents Association about
 
04:48:31.128 --> 04:48:31.138 align:start position:0%
that as well and and
 
04:48:33.708 --> 04:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
we probably spent about half an hour I
 
04:48:35.930 --> 04:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
think just on the topic of the value of
 
04:48:37.730 --> 04:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
niask accreditations should it be in
 
04:48:39.708 --> 04:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
this section will schools continue to do
 
04:48:42.050 --> 04:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
it because it does have value far beyond
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
this I don't think that whether it's a
 
04:48:46.850 --> 04:48:46.860 align:start position:0%
substitute for IMS or not doesn't take
 
04:48:48.170 --> 04:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
away any of the value of the nearest
 
04:48:49.550 --> 04:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
accreditation and many schools will
 
04:48:51.650 --> 04:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
continue to do that
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
I think the thing too is historically
 
04:48:55.730 --> 04:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
this used to be part be part of
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
accountability for an adequate education
 
04:48:59.628 --> 04:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
but that was previously that was before
 
04:49:02.330 --> 04:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
we had ibas and pbas being required of
 
04:49:06.350 --> 04:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
all schools so even so what we're trying
 
04:49:07.490 --> 04:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
to say is we want to use the same
 
04:49:08.990 --> 04:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
measurement for all schools across the
 
04:49:10.670 --> 04:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
board but Force like all right some
 
04:49:12.350 --> 04:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
schools were Neha schools some schools
 
04:49:14.208 --> 04:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
were eyeball School some schools are P
 
04:49:15.230 --> 04:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
bass schools and there's different
 
04:49:18.770 --> 04:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
measurements but now you have changed in
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
2019 saying the measurement for
 
04:49:23.510 --> 04:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
providing adequate education is a better
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
school is participating in ibass and P
 
04:49:29.030 --> 04:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
bass so all right we have the same
 
04:49:30.890 --> 04:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
measurement across the board so let's
 
04:49:33.830 --> 04:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
not add this kind of third one of of me
 
04:49:36.170 --> 04:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
ask in there and we can still encourage
 
04:49:37.610 --> 04:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
and support schools going through the
 
04:49:41.090 --> 04:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
niask process but it's accreditation is
 
04:49:42.730 --> 04:49:42.740 align:start position:0%
not necessarily
 
04:49:44.690 --> 04:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
indicator providing an adequate
 
04:49:44.700 --> 04:49:46.850 align:start position:0%
indicator providing an adequate
education

04:49:46.850 --> 04:49:46.860 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:49:48.890 --> 04:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
so that was our pet saving if you want
 
04:49:50.628 --> 04:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
to put it back in you certainly can
 
04:49:50.638 --> 04:49:51.650 align:start position:0%
to put it back in you certainly can
but

04:49:51.650 --> 04:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:49:53.270 --> 04:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
we just did it we didn't feel that it
 
04:49:57.770 --> 04:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.208 --> 04:50:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:05.570 --> 04:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
a big Arrow by that one from left to
 
04:50:05.580 --> 04:50:06.590 align:start position:0%
a big Arrow by that one from left to
right

04:50:06.590 --> 04:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:50:06.600 --> 04:50:07.670 align:start position:0%
right
okay

04:50:07.670 --> 04:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:50:07.680 --> 04:50:09.350 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:12.170 --> 04:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
anything else on that page
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:54.650 --> 04:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
so did um did we have the the does the
 
04:50:56.868 --> 04:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability exist
 
04:51:00.708 --> 04:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
in current law yes okay and and was it
 
04:51:03.948 --> 04:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
in current law is it as distinct as
 
04:51:06.288 --> 04:51:06.298 align:start position:0%
you're you're making it here we haven't
 
04:51:08.510 --> 04:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
changed it okay
 
04:51:10.910 --> 04:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's what had been an h and so we
 
04:51:13.310 --> 04:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
simply took right and brought it in yeah
 
04:51:18.288 --> 04:51:18.298 align:start position:0%
and and now putting it under 193 e
 
04:51:18.298 --> 04:51:22.070 align:start position:0%
and and now putting it under 193 e
uh

04:51:22.070 --> 04:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:23.930 --> 04:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
in the adequacy
 
04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
yeah and and I think the so
 
04:51:28.550 --> 04:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
previously they read separately and
 
04:51:29.810 --> 04:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
that's where we are ending up with
 
04:51:31.250 --> 04:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
everybody being confused and they're
 
04:51:32.448 --> 04:51:32.458 align:start position:0%
calling us and like well why do I have
 
04:51:34.610 --> 04:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
to do PBS I can pass ibas and like whoa
 
04:51:36.410 --> 04:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
because it says and and you have to read
 
04:51:38.570 --> 04:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
them together and it made sense
 
04:51:40.128 --> 04:51:40.138 align:start position:0%
historically that they were separated
 
04:51:41.810 --> 04:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
because they were completely independent
 
04:51:44.270 --> 04:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
systems in the past but when we changed
 
04:51:46.368 --> 04:51:46.378 align:start position:0%
the or to an and that's where it really
 
04:51:48.410 --> 04:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
needed to be read together I'm sorry I'm
 
04:51:50.270 --> 04:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
sorry you've been no you said this like
 
04:51:52.030 --> 04:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
three or four times
 
04:51:54.530 --> 04:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
yeah this is what we're doing this is
 
04:51:56.628 --> 04:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
this is what we've been doing and no and
 
04:51:58.250 --> 04:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
it's because we've got a million calls
 
04:52:00.470 --> 04:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
about this and and people are confused
 
04:52:02.270 --> 04:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
and we're confused and the number of
 
04:52:03.650 --> 04:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
times that Nate has corrected me when
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
I've said it incorrectly or vice versa
 
04:52:07.910 --> 04:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's very confusing
 
04:52:07.920 --> 04:52:09.350 align:start position:0%
it's it's very confusing
but

04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:52:11.930 --> 04:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
why did you change the the visitations
 
04:52:14.030 --> 04:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
to the schools as a May instead of a
 
04:52:17.150 --> 04:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
shell wow
 
04:52:18.590 --> 04:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
the department does not have any staff
 
04:52:20.448 --> 04:52:20.458 align:start position:0%
to do this the department has not had
 
04:52:21.708 --> 04:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
any staff to do this for a very long
 
04:52:23.868 --> 04:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
time if you want the department to do it
 
04:52:25.850 --> 04:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
and you want to keep it a shell we just
 
04:52:27.410 --> 04:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
need a team of people to do this work
 
04:52:29.990 --> 04:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
but we are not doing it we haven't done
 
04:52:32.090 --> 04:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
it for a very long time yeah we have no
 
04:52:33.948 --> 04:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
problem with doing the work but we
 
04:52:37.850 --> 04:52:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:40.250 --> 04:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
well let me ask you because the schools
 
04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
have to pay for it and it's very
 
04:52:41.280 --> 04:52:45.830 align:start position:0%
have to pay for it and it's very
expensive

04:52:45.830 --> 04:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:47.628 --> 04:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
when you apply for currency are you
 
04:52:52.610 --> 04:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:55.930 --> 04:52:55.940 align:start position:0%
I'll get off it what
 
04:53:00.850 --> 04:53:00.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:04.150 --> 04:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
it is optional
 
04:53:06.890 --> 04:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
that's good at three o'clock we're gonna
 
04:53:08.448 --> 04:53:08.458 align:start position:0%
go to three o'clock because we did have
 
04:53:11.690 --> 04:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:11.700 --> 04:53:14.448 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:53:14.448 --> 04:53:14.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:16.610 --> 04:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
so you will make it a shell if you can
 
04:53:20.030 --> 04:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
get more money huh of course
 
04:53:25.070 --> 04:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:28.368 --> 04:53:28.378 align:start position:0%
well could you use the me ask report as
 
04:53:28.378 --> 04:53:29.708 align:start position:0%
well could you use the me ask report as
your

04:53:29.708 --> 04:53:29.718 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:53:32.750 --> 04:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
site visit for those schools that do me
 
04:53:35.628 --> 04:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
ask and then have a
 
04:53:38.208 --> 04:53:38.218 align:start position:0%
Core group that you contract with you
 
04:53:39.830 --> 04:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
know like retired superintendents that
 
04:53:42.410 --> 04:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
would go out and do the same thing with
 
04:53:44.810 --> 04:53:44.820 align:start position:0%
a team like me ask you know you have a
 
04:53:46.970 --> 04:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
teacher on a team it still costs money
 
04:53:48.910 --> 04:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
though I mean
 
04:53:51.230 --> 04:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
whatever you want that system to be like
 
04:53:53.990 --> 04:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
we can certainly build up this morning
 
04:53:55.610 --> 04:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's more of kind of a
 
04:53:58.128 --> 04:53:58.138 align:start position:0%
parking lot decision of like what do we
 
04:53:59.628 --> 04:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
want it to be versus what does the
 
04:54:01.368 --> 04:54:01.378 align:start position:0%
current law have
 
04:54:02.330 --> 04:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
um because when we're having a
 
04:54:03.770 --> 04:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
conversation with the superintendents
 
04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
they had lots of great ideas of how to
 
04:54:07.970 --> 04:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
make this a much better system but we
 
04:54:09.590 --> 04:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
said let's come back to that next year
 
04:54:11.090 --> 04:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
let's make the current system that we
 
04:54:12.590 --> 04:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
have right now make sense so we can read
 
04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
it together and then we'll talk about
 
04:54:17.030 --> 04:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
maybe introducing some legislation and
 
04:54:19.910 --> 04:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
working together and saying what let's
 
04:54:21.470 --> 04:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
codify these great ideas that you have
 
04:54:23.270 --> 04:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
to actually improve the system so that's
 
04:54:26.030 --> 04:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
step two step one is figure out what
 
04:54:26.990 --> 04:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be doing right now
 
04:54:27.000 --> 04:54:28.510 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be doing right now
right

04:54:28.510 --> 04:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:54:32.030 --> 04:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
you you've mentioned throughout this uh
 
04:54:35.150 --> 04:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
review several times about working with
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
the superintendent now could you explain
 
04:54:40.730 --> 04:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
to us exactly how much time have the
 
04:54:42.410 --> 04:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
superintendents you've worked with the
 
04:54:44.810 --> 04:54:44.820 align:start position:0%
superintendents on this particular piece
 
04:54:46.368 --> 04:54:46.378 align:start position:0%
of legislation how much time have you
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
spent with them yeah so we
 
04:54:52.128 --> 04:54:52.138 align:start position:0%
um we have we first we started out with
 
04:54:53.448 --> 04:54:53.458 align:start position:0%
a smaller group of superintendent
 
04:54:54.530 --> 04:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
representatives and School Board
 
04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives that came into the
 
04:54:58.070 --> 04:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
department and met with us for several
 
04:54:58.080 --> 04:54:59.270 align:start position:0%
department and met with us for several
hours

04:54:59.270 --> 04:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
hours
 
04:55:01.730 --> 04:55:01.740 align:start position:0%
um and then we had a committee of about
 
04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 superintendents come to the
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
department and they spent an entire
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon with us we went through this
 
04:55:09.230 --> 04:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
line by line like this I do wish we had
 
04:55:10.550 --> 04:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
this this document because it would have
 
04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
been helpful
 
04:55:15.050 --> 04:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
um but uh we did this and and and they
 
04:55:17.390 --> 04:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
had lots of great suggestions comments
 
04:55:17.400 --> 04:55:18.530 align:start position:0%
had lots of great suggestions comments
feedback

04:55:18.530 --> 04:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
04:55:20.868 --> 04:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
um and then we then met with a group of
 
04:55:23.930 --> 04:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
about 20 additional superintendents in
 
04:55:26.868 --> 04:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
January whenever that was
 
04:55:29.750 --> 04:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
um and went over this with them again
 
04:55:32.990 --> 04:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
um and so and Jerry fruit was actually
 
04:55:34.850 --> 04:55:34.860 align:start position:0%
at the Senate meeting
 
04:55:34.860 --> 04:55:35.570 align:start position:0%
at the Senate meeting
um

04:55:35.570 --> 04:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:37.850 --> 04:55:37.860 align:start position:0%
when this was presented to the Senate
 
04:55:40.310 --> 04:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
and he he testified that he supported
 
04:55:41.868 --> 04:55:41.878 align:start position:0%
this bill and thanked the department for
 
04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
the support and the work that we've done
 
04:55:44.570 --> 04:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
with them to collaborate on this project
 
04:55:44.580 --> 04:55:48.470 align:start position:0%
with them to collaborate on this project
so

04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:50.930 --> 04:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions I
 
04:55:52.128 --> 04:55:52.138 align:start position:0%
think we're getting down to the point
 
04:55:55.010 --> 04:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
where we're running on Steam here
 
04:55:56.948 --> 04:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
um while we're while we're on this yeah
 
04:55:59.750 --> 04:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
this part on reporting yeah bottom of
 
04:56:01.250 --> 04:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
25. yeah
 
04:56:01.260 --> 04:56:02.868 align:start position:0%
25. yeah
um

04:56:02.868 --> 04:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:07.190 --> 04:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
so it so in reading this the the
 
04:56:09.830 --> 04:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
currently the annual the annual
 
04:56:11.330 --> 04:56:11.340 align:start position:0%
reporting is just based on the
 
04:56:14.690 --> 04:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
performance um uh accountability and so
 
04:56:16.788 --> 04:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
the new reporting will be on both input
 
04:56:18.830 --> 04:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
and Performance Based
 
04:56:21.530 --> 04:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
yeah so we've reported on both they just
 
04:56:23.448 --> 04:56:23.458 align:start position:0%
existed separately so because we are
 
04:56:24.830 --> 04:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
putting them together in the same
 
04:56:26.990 --> 04:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
section of Statute we tried to put all
 
04:56:30.708 --> 04:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
the reporting pieces together okay what
 
04:56:33.110 --> 04:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
um if you were to if you were to take
 
04:56:35.868 --> 04:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
the the input and performance space for
 
04:56:39.190 --> 04:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
porting and then make a determination
 
04:56:43.250 --> 04:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
down in the the uh the bottom of the new
 
04:56:45.770 --> 04:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
language uh uh identifying all schools
 
04:56:46.970 --> 04:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
that have failed to demonstrate the
 
04:56:48.708 --> 04:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an education based on
 
04:56:50.628 --> 04:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
those two factors
 
04:56:53.150 --> 04:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
um would um would that report would
 
04:56:55.310 --> 04:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
those identified schools be any
 
04:56:57.530 --> 04:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
different than schools that are being
 
04:56:59.090 --> 04:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
identified now
 
04:57:01.490 --> 04:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
so it that will be the list so the
 
04:57:03.770 --> 04:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
schools are identified as CSI TSI
 
04:57:05.448 --> 04:57:05.458 align:start position:0%
schools that's the performance-based
 
04:57:07.250 --> 04:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
accountability system so it would
 
04:57:09.170 --> 04:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
essentially be an identical list
 
04:57:11.470 --> 04:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
except that the state accountability
 
04:57:14.270 --> 04:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
applies the rules to all schools while
 
04:57:16.070 --> 04:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
our current federal list only applies to
 
04:57:18.708 --> 04:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
Title One schools so you would see the
 
04:57:20.990 --> 04:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
list expand from justice state
 
04:57:22.490 --> 04:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
accountability perspective because we
 
04:57:23.750 --> 04:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
would be looking at all schools
 
04:57:26.868 --> 04:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
regardless of Title One funding
 
04:57:29.090 --> 04:57:29.100 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is so the
 
04:57:30.470 --> 04:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
performance phase is tied to the federal
 
04:57:32.510 --> 04:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
accountability system right now the I've
 
04:57:33.770 --> 04:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
asked us if somebody were to actually
 
04:57:35.750 --> 04:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
fail ibass I guess they would be they
 
04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
would also be consumed considered not
 
04:57:39.708 --> 04:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
providing an adequate education so we
 
04:57:41.930 --> 04:57:41.940 align:start position:0%
have not published an ibass list or a
 
04:57:43.850 --> 04:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
failed ibass list and
 
04:57:46.550 --> 04:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know 20 years so so like a what
 
04:57:49.010 --> 04:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
like an ibass list would be based on
 
04:57:52.550 --> 04:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
that the earlier list on the page
 
04:57:54.910 --> 04:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
22 there's a version of it right right
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
of all the things so World Language is
 
04:57:59.750 --> 04:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
one of those things so how would a
 
04:58:01.850 --> 04:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
district like Pittsfield
 
04:58:04.610 --> 04:58:04.620 align:start position:0%
um fare on the world language
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
front so it would depend on the school
 
04:58:07.440 --> 04:58:08.810 align:start position:0%
front so it would depend on the school
level

04:58:08.810 --> 04:58:08.820 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:58:11.330 --> 04:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
um so there are not required standards
 
04:58:13.250 --> 04:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
for World languages the elementary right
 
04:58:15.170 --> 04:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
there is the option to have a world
 
04:58:16.368 --> 04:58:16.378 align:start position:0%
language program at the middle school
 
04:58:18.350 --> 04:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
and if a middle school chooses to do
 
04:58:19.550 --> 04:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
that there are standards they have to
 
04:58:21.650 --> 04:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
meet so one question would be do you
 
04:58:23.208 --> 04:58:23.218 align:start position:0%
offer it at the middle school level if
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
so are you compliant with these required
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
areas and then at the high school levels
 
04:58:29.208 --> 04:58:29.218 align:start position:0%
you know you are required to have a
 
04:58:31.070 --> 04:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
world languages program you have to have
 
04:58:32.868 --> 04:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
a certain number of course offerings in
 
04:58:35.208 --> 04:58:35.218 align:start position:0%
your program of studies you have to have
 
04:58:37.310 --> 04:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
at least two distinct separate languages
 
04:58:39.410 --> 04:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
that are being offered and then there's
 
04:58:40.730 --> 04:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
some standards that go along with that
 
04:58:42.410 --> 04:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
so from a compliance perspective we
 
04:58:44.150 --> 04:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
would be looking to see do you meet each
 
04:58:46.190 --> 04:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
of those minimum standards under the
 
04:58:48.170 --> 04:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
world languages program so that would be
 
04:58:50.270 --> 04:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
that would be a new
 
04:58:50.280 --> 04:58:50.868 align:start position:0%
that would be a new
um

04:58:50.868 --> 04:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:53.590 --> 04:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
even though the input
 
04:58:57.170 --> 04:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
accountability exists now the report
 
04:59:00.650 --> 04:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
would be considering those those Meeting
 
04:59:03.288 --> 04:59:03.298 align:start position:0%
those inputs uh where in the past it
 
04:59:06.128 --> 04:59:06.138 align:start position:0%
hadn't so so
 
04:59:08.810 --> 04:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
this is pretty material for schools I
 
04:59:11.030 --> 04:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
think it's so schools used to do that
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
and there would have been a report
 
04:59:13.490 --> 04:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
involved we haven't done it a number of
 
04:59:15.288 --> 04:59:15.298 align:start position:0%
years because we've had the staff to be
 
04:59:17.628 --> 04:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
able to do the the ibass and the
 
04:59:19.368 --> 04:59:19.378 align:start position:0%
reporting and the current form that it
 
04:59:22.250 --> 04:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
had been previously was a really long
 
04:59:23.448 --> 04:59:23.458 align:start position:0%
checklist if you look at all those
 
04:59:24.948 --> 04:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
minimum standards underwater languages
 
04:59:27.230 --> 04:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
you would have had about 40 or 50 items
 
04:59:29.030 --> 04:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
and schools would check yes or no are
 
04:59:31.490 --> 04:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
you compliant yes are you not no
 
04:59:34.010 --> 04:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
and I would imagine some schools are
 
04:59:35.810 --> 04:59:35.820 align:start position:0%
just going through and checking yes
 
04:59:37.910 --> 04:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
because it was simply a yes and no
 
04:59:39.770 --> 04:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
checklist that we would collect the
 
04:59:40.788 --> 04:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
information but I don't think there was
 
04:59:42.590 --> 04:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of reporting being done because
 
04:59:44.270 --> 04:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
that really was what the school visits
 
04:59:46.010 --> 04:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
were about because you would go out with
 
04:59:47.628 --> 04:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
a team and you might have a world
 
04:59:49.490 --> 04:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
languages expert on that team to go out
 
04:59:50.810 --> 04:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
and say okay let me take a look at your
 
04:59:52.970 --> 04:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
world languages program is it compliant
 
04:59:54.770 --> 04:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
with these standards you've indicated in
 
04:59:57.410 --> 04:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
your survey to us that it is and I think
 
04:59:59.090 --> 04:59:59.100 align:start position:0%
that's to Caitlyn's point where she's
 
05:00:00.830 --> 05:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
getting at is to really go out and do
 
05:00:03.050 --> 05:00:03.060 align:start position:0%
those in-depth site surveys you know at
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
the very least you're going to want some
 
05:00:06.590 --> 05:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
people experienced with math and Ela and
 
05:00:08.990 --> 05:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
science to look at those programs and
 
05:00:10.970 --> 05:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
and verify those responses on the ibass
 
05:00:13.730 --> 05:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
okay okay great thank you Nate thank you
 
05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay we're right at three o'clock and I
 
05:00:18.050 --> 05:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
think we ought to call it right here so
 
05:00:21.830 --> 05:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're at the bottom page 25
 
05:00:26.150 --> 05:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:36.530 --> 05:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:37.850 --> 05:00:37.860 align:start position:0%
and then we got to get the stuff you
 
05:00:43.070 --> 05:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:46.310 --> 05:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:48.948 --> 05:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
yeah of that and don't worry Jen's on it
 
05:00:50.390 --> 05:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
she is
 
05:00:50.400 --> 05:00:51.110 align:start position:0%
she is
um

05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:53.448 --> 05:00:53.458 align:start position:0%
so we have another meeting scheduled for
 
05:00:55.310 --> 05:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
this starting at 11 30 on Wednesday
 
05:00:58.490 --> 05:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
it'll be the afternoon
 
05:01:00.708 --> 05:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
so as soon as we finish executing on
 
05:01:02.750 --> 05:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
Wednesday we'd start hammering away on
 
05:01:04.490 --> 05:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
this again
 
05:01:07.430 --> 05:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can plow through it
 
05:01:10.850 --> 05:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
any any questions or
 
05:01:13.070 --> 05:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
something good for the order
 
05:01:14.770 --> 05:01:14.780 align:start position:0%
it's nope
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much Caitlin and
 
05:01:18.830 --> 05:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
Nate for coming here and all those that
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
came with them sending through this
 
05:01:23.270 --> 05:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate the opportunity
 
05:01:24.530 --> 05:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
to have this discussion with the
 
05:01:29.208 --> 05:01:29.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:31.310 --> 05:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
we actually we did have these
 
05:01:33.050 --> 05:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
discussions both on it
 
05:01:34.910 --> 05:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
we at the time when we asked
 
05:01:36.410 --> 05:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative Ward to sponsor the bill
 
05:01:38.090 --> 05:01:38.100 align:start position:0%
for us we sat down with it and went line
 
05:01:39.530 --> 05:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
by line it was a several hour-long
 
05:01:39.540 --> 05:01:47.830 align:start position:0%
by line it was a several hour-long
meeting

05:01:47.830 --> 05:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:59.200 --> 05:01:59.210 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:59.210 --> 05:02:14.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:02:14.510 --> 05:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:16.670 --> 05:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
um this one where I had him as as the
 
05:02:21.230 --> 05:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:34.080 --> 05:07:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:07:29.510 --> 05:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:29.520 --> 05:08:56.750 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:08:56.750 --> 05:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:59.390 --> 05:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
um further into the issue
 
05:09:06.650 --> 05:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:06.660 --> 05:09:08.930 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:09:08.930 --> 05:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:09:11.570 --> 05:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
the amended bill
 
05:09:11.580 --> 05:09:12.830 align:start position:0%
the amended bill
um

05:09:12.830 --> 05:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:15.770 --> 05:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
that are you familiar with the amended
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment that Senator Ward

Senator Waters yes
 
05:09:28.020 --> 05:09:29.510 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters yes
um

05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:29.520 --> 05:09:30.470 align:start position:0%
um
yes

05:09:30.470 --> 05:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
written parental concern consent yes

05:09:37.138 --> 05:09:38.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:09:38.030 --> 05:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:42.350 --> 05:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:45.110 --> 05:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
go over what the intention is a little
 
05:09:45.120 --> 05:09:46.010 align:start position:0%
go over what the intention is a little
bit

05:09:46.010 --> 05:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
bit
 
05:09:50.270 --> 05:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
um social media is uh quite a a broad
 
05:09:50.280 --> 05:09:53.628 align:start position:0%
um social media is uh quite a a broad
terminology

05:09:53.628 --> 05:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:55.490 --> 05:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:09:58.550 --> 05:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh I've I've done research over the past
 
05:10:00.470 --> 05:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
few years on digital badging and
 
05:10:03.170 --> 05:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
credentialing and have more questions on
 
05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
that and I'm not sure how that
 
05:10:07.730 --> 05:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
specifically fits into
 
05:10:11.448 --> 05:10:11.458 align:start position:0%
um what the goal is here sure absolutely
 
05:10:14.690 --> 05:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
happy to address that so uh really the
 
05:10:18.050 --> 05:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
purpose or the intent is to allow
 
05:10:20.930 --> 05:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
students to be able to use some very
 
05:10:22.910 --> 05:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
specific kinds of social media accounts
 
05:10:25.750 --> 05:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
while they're in um in high school
 
05:10:29.270 --> 05:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
particularly without naming names uh but
 
05:10:32.208 --> 05:10:32.218 align:start position:0%
I will uh LinkedIn the idea being that
 
05:10:34.368 --> 05:10:34.378 align:start position:0%
that's a way to authentically
 
05:10:37.850 --> 05:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
um curate and to to have
 
05:10:41.510 --> 05:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
um a record of Competency skills things
 
05:10:43.430 --> 05:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that they could do for employment
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
which also persists after after high
 
05:10:50.390 --> 05:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
school so it's there are um a number of
 
05:10:52.368 --> 05:10:52.378 align:start position:0%
platforms that are really designed to be
 
05:10:55.490 --> 05:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
used in education that are
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
um something that when the student
 
05:11:00.230 --> 05:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
graduates doesn't travel with them but
 
05:11:02.150 --> 05:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
something like LinkedIn is very portable
 
05:11:03.708 --> 05:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
so employers
 
05:11:03.718 --> 05:11:04.310 align:start position:0%
so employers
um

05:11:04.310 --> 05:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:06.410 --> 05:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
we'll look at it and it's something
 
05:11:09.830 --> 05:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
where the student can say as a result of
 
05:11:09.840 --> 05:11:10.788 align:start position:0%
where the student can say as a result of
my

05:11:10.788 --> 05:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:11:10.798 --> 05:11:11.330 align:start position:0%
my
um

05:11:11.330 --> 05:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:13.368 --> 05:11:13.378 align:start position:0%
work experience and educational
 
05:11:15.590 --> 05:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
experiences I can do this this this and
 
05:11:18.590 --> 05:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
this so again really it's it it's not
 
05:11:20.990 --> 05:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
narrowly naming uh LinkedIn specifically
 
05:11:22.970 --> 05:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
but that really is sort of the intent is
 
05:11:25.190 --> 05:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
to use LinkedIn or other platforms that
 
05:11:27.530 --> 05:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
emerge that have a similar
 
05:11:32.030 --> 05:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:34.670 --> 05:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you for being
 
05:11:34.680 --> 05:11:35.810 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you for being
here

05:11:35.810 --> 05:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:11:38.030 --> 05:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
um my only concern really my primary
 
05:11:40.010 --> 05:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
concern is with safety because there's
 
05:11:41.930 --> 05:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
nothing in the bill as amended by the
 
05:11:44.690 --> 05:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
Senate that would say it has to be an
 
05:11:46.730 --> 05:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
app designed for education and there
 
05:11:48.288 --> 05:11:48.298 align:start position:0%
could be other applications maybe for
 
05:11:50.750 --> 05:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
other purposes that student could use in
 
05:11:53.448 --> 05:11:53.458 align:start position:0%
a manner that's unsafe so I'm just
 
05:11:55.310 --> 05:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
curious how you think we should address
 
05:11:56.990 --> 05:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
something like that that is a really
 
05:11:58.250 --> 05:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
good point
 
05:12:00.830 --> 05:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
um I I think because the intent is for
 
05:12:03.650 --> 05:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
curating Career Development
 
05:12:03.660 --> 05:12:04.970 align:start position:0%
curating Career Development
um

05:12:04.970 --> 05:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:08.330 --> 05:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
evidence I think that that if it were to
 
05:12:09.708 --> 05:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
be a minute of language that would
 
05:12:11.448 --> 05:12:11.458 align:start position:0%
address that specific usage I think that
 
05:12:13.310 --> 05:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
would help provide some some clarity and
 
05:12:14.628 --> 05:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
that could be something that I would
 
05:12:15.890 --> 05:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
think could come out in administrative
 
05:12:15.900 --> 05:12:18.970 align:start position:0%
think could come out in administrative
rules

05:12:18.970 --> 05:12:18.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:24.110 --> 05:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:30.288 --> 05:12:30.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:40.250 --> 05:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
um as with the amendment this was my
 
05:12:43.310 --> 05:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
first time drafting an amendment so I am
 
05:12:44.750 --> 05:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
willing to play around with the wording
 
05:12:47.930 --> 05:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
as the subcommittee sees fit but again
 
05:12:50.510 --> 05:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
my goal is just to ensure safety in
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
terms of something like this would be
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
implemented I think from my perspective
 
05:12:56.750 --> 05:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
I think that absolutely addresses that
 
05:12:56.760 --> 05:12:58.190 align:start position:0%
I think that absolutely addresses that
concern

05:12:58.190 --> 05:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:13:00.110 --> 05:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
um if I may could I read the amendment
 
05:13:02.390 --> 05:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
out I've brought with me a couple folks
 
05:13:07.150 --> 05:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:19.610 --> 05:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:19.620 --> 05:13:26.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:13:26.090 --> 05:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:28.430 --> 05:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
and the reason um that we had them come
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
along is that um yeah thank you and I'll
 
05:13:32.690 --> 05:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
let them introduce themselves in a
 
05:13:34.788 --> 05:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
moment um they'll have some um some good
 
05:13:36.948 --> 05:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
input about the some of the security
 
05:13:40.490 --> 05:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
concerns as they they are approached in
 
05:13:44.890 --> 05:13:44.900 align:start position:0%
districts but um representative if I may
 
05:13:47.090 --> 05:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
this definition shall not apply to
 
05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
platforms used for demonstrating
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
evidence in student Career Development
 
05:13:52.910 --> 05:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section shall encourage
 
05:13:54.650 --> 05:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
student involvement in careers as
 
05:13:56.990 --> 05:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
influencers social media models internet
 
05:13:58.970 --> 05:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
personalities or otherwise diminished
 
05:14:01.128 --> 05:14:01.138 align:start position:0%
student safety which again from my
 
05:14:02.448 --> 05:14:02.458 align:start position:0%
perspective I think addresses those
 
05:14:05.570 --> 05:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
concerns nicely it could be fleshed out
 
05:14:07.670 --> 05:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit more with some clarity in
 
05:14:15.650 --> 05:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:18.530 --> 05:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
if I'm Pam McLeod I'm the director of
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
technology in the information security
 
05:14:22.910 --> 05:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
officer in Concord here in the school
 
05:14:25.670 --> 05:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
district and this is Josh Olstead he's
 
05:14:27.830 --> 05:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
from Oyster River Cooperative school
 
05:14:32.510 --> 05:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
district and we have been since HB 1612
 
05:14:34.010 --> 05:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
which I know some of you were really
 
05:14:37.550 --> 05:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
instrumental in we have been we've
 
05:14:40.788 --> 05:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
founded and have been organizing our
 
05:14:43.250 --> 05:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
response to that bill so we've created a
 
05:14:45.730 --> 05:14:45.740 align:start position:0%
student data privacy Consortium
 
05:14:50.330 --> 05:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
which currently includes about 130
 
05:14:53.390 --> 05:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
000 students across New Hampshire and
 
05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
protects data privacy we've managed to
 
05:14:57.708 --> 05:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
get about 1300 different online
 
05:14:59.930 --> 05:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
applications with data privacy
 
05:15:01.750 --> 05:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
agreements since
 
05:15:05.810 --> 05:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
2019. so we're pretty well versed in um
 
05:15:07.970 --> 05:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
in that side of things I know that's a
 
05:15:10.788 --> 05:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
different RSA but
 
05:15:10.798 --> 05:15:13.868 align:start position:0%
different RSA but
foreign

05:15:13.868 --> 05:15:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:16.010 --> 05:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:15:17.810 --> 05:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
being here to take these questions
 
05:15:19.910 --> 05:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I did a fair bit of research to try
 
05:15:22.128 --> 05:15:22.138 align:start position:0%
to understand the the real intent and
 
05:15:23.690 --> 05:15:23.700 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the bill and we had
 
05:15:25.010 --> 05:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
some concerns that we previously
 
05:15:26.750 --> 05:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
discussed about things
 
05:15:29.030 --> 05:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
what I found and I want you to tell me
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
if this is roughly accurate is the is
 
05:15:33.590 --> 05:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
the platform LinkedIn once you get an
 
05:15:34.610 --> 05:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
account and this is a business
 
05:15:36.470 --> 05:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
networking platform primarily it's used
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
primarily to get jobs in the network
 
05:15:42.170 --> 05:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
um once you're on that you can take
 
05:15:46.010 --> 05:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
quizzes on any number of varied subject
 
05:15:48.650 --> 05:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
matter in order to as they put it
 
05:15:51.470 --> 05:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrate a competency and achieve a
 
05:15:53.750 --> 05:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
digital badge that you can place then on
 
05:15:55.850 --> 05:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
your profile to advertise that you have
 
05:15:57.948 --> 05:15:57.958 align:start position:0%
a competency in this is that is that
 
05:16:00.050 --> 05:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
roughly what we're looking to do yes yes
 
05:16:03.410 --> 05:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
if I may follow up on that
 
05:16:03.420 --> 05:16:04.368 align:start position:0%
if I may follow up on that
um

05:16:04.368 --> 05:16:04.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:07.610 --> 05:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing there because the the
 
05:16:10.430 --> 05:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
test there the quiz would be taken by
 
05:16:12.170 --> 05:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
the student based on the knowledge that
 
05:16:15.830 --> 05:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
they've already attained in school so
 
05:16:17.030 --> 05:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
there's really nothing that would
 
05:16:19.190 --> 05:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
prevent them from being able to do this
 
05:16:21.410 --> 05:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
to achieve this competency of these
 
05:16:24.230 --> 05:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
badges outside of school on their own
 
05:16:27.170 --> 05:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay and one last
 
05:16:28.788 --> 05:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up I think to get to the heart of
 
05:16:31.970 --> 05:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
a little bit is sure certainly data
 
05:16:33.410 --> 05:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
privacy is a concern but it's not
 
05:16:36.170 --> 05:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
actually my foremost concern my biggest
 
05:16:38.390 --> 05:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
concern here is
 
05:16:42.050 --> 05:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
what happens when we create a sort of
 
05:16:43.910 --> 05:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
Industry standard across the state where
 
05:16:46.670 --> 05:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
students are doing this on social media
 
05:16:49.490 --> 05:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
and using that to find jobs
 
05:16:51.170 --> 05:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
for out straight straight from high
 
05:16:54.530 --> 05:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
school and in high school and they're
 
05:16:57.170 --> 05:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
now being subjected to the third party
 
05:17:00.110 --> 05:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
terms of service of the social media
 
05:17:03.230 --> 05:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
platform that is going to significantly
 
05:17:06.170 --> 05:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
dictate their ability to get a job and
 
05:17:07.788 --> 05:17:07.798 align:start position:0%
possibly represent a significant
 
05:17:10.250 --> 05:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
constraint on things like their freedom
 
05:17:14.208 --> 05:17:14.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:14.218 --> 05:17:15.890 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

05:17:15.890 --> 05:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
05:17:18.650 --> 05:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about that I agree with you
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
the terms the terms of service of the
 
05:17:23.208 --> 05:17:23.218 align:start position:0%
platform absolutely apply and we looked
 
05:17:26.270 --> 05:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
at LinkedIn it's age 16. so
 
05:17:28.670 --> 05:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
um there is no way to bypass those terms
 
05:17:30.350 --> 05:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
of service unless you have a data
 
05:17:31.930 --> 05:17:31.940 align:start position:0%
privacy agreement with the company
 
05:17:34.368 --> 05:17:34.378 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft I think
 
05:17:36.050 --> 05:17:36.060 align:start position:0%
there is hope that someday they will
 
05:17:38.448 --> 05:17:38.458 align:start position:0%
have a high school
 
05:17:42.050 --> 05:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
version of the platform
 
05:17:45.890 --> 05:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
um I think a concern would be
 
05:17:47.750 --> 05:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
um there's an instant messaging part of
 
05:17:50.150 --> 05:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
the platform so just like any other
 
05:17:52.250 --> 05:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
social media there could be instant
 
05:17:54.590 --> 05:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
messaging between adults and students
 
05:17:56.750 --> 05:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
that the school district would not be
 
05:17:58.850 --> 05:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
pervy purview to but they could create
 
05:18:00.890 --> 05:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
that with their own personal accounts
 
05:18:02.208 --> 05:18:02.218 align:start position:0%
and that would happen there as well
 
05:18:03.830 --> 05:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
could happen
 
05:18:05.868 --> 05:18:05.878 align:start position:0%
if I may just one more to clarify just a
 
05:18:07.970 --> 05:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
little bit of my concern so my concern
 
05:18:10.010 --> 05:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
really centers around their terms of
 
05:18:12.530 --> 05:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
service when it comes to things like for
 
05:18:13.910 --> 05:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
instance they have something called a
 
05:18:16.850 --> 05:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
hate speech policy now of course none of
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
us like you know hearing terrible
 
05:18:20.030 --> 05:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
bigoted things and stuff like that
 
05:18:22.850 --> 05:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
however the US Constitution does not
 
05:18:24.650 --> 05:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
have a hate speech policy it's it's free
 
05:18:26.750 --> 05:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
speech and by by putting students on
 
05:18:29.448 --> 05:18:29.458 align:start position:0%
this platform for a job purpose they're
 
05:18:32.270 --> 05:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
now going to be subject to third-party
 
05:18:34.250 --> 05:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
hate speech guidelines that a student
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
could say something dumb at some point
 
05:18:37.490 --> 05:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
and students do
 
05:18:39.650 --> 05:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden their job prospects
 
05:18:42.350 --> 05:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
are potentially ruined as a result of
 
05:18:43.610 --> 05:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
that is that a concern that we should
 
05:18:45.350 --> 05:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
have yeah
 
05:18:47.510 --> 05:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
I agree with you
 
05:18:49.910 --> 05:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
um I I feel like it's part of our
 
05:18:51.890 --> 05:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
certainly in schools and I think this is
 
05:18:54.310 --> 05:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of what schools try to do is um
 
05:18:57.890 --> 05:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
they try to help guide students into
 
05:19:00.650 --> 05:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
professional tone of voice professional
 
05:19:02.930 --> 05:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
you know your public your digital
 
05:19:04.850 --> 05:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
footprint right
 
05:19:08.208 --> 05:19:08.218 align:start position:0%
um in a sort of a guided way so that
 
05:19:10.610 --> 05:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
students don't graduate and then go out
 
05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
and make those mistakes you know if if
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
the idea being that if a teacher is
 
05:19:16.810 --> 05:19:16.820 align:start position:0%
guiding them they're less likely to run
 
05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
afoul of those particular policies but
 
05:19:22.128 --> 05:19:22.138 align:start position:0%
yeah they're absolutely subject to the
 
05:19:23.930 --> 05:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
terms of the platform
 
05:19:23.940 --> 05:19:26.628 align:start position:0%
terms of the platform
yep

05:19:26.628 --> 05:19:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:30.170 --> 05:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:35.090 --> 05:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:37.970 --> 05:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
that exist in in Industry right now and
 
05:19:40.850 --> 05:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
that are still developing that are
 
05:19:43.788 --> 05:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
specifically badging
 
05:19:47.288 --> 05:19:47.298 align:start position:0%
and they do
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
a better job of privacy
 
05:19:56.150 --> 05:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
Etc as well as verifying the badges and
 
05:19:58.368 --> 05:19:58.378 align:start position:0%
all of that kind of stuff is there a
 
05:20:00.470 --> 05:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
reason why we're not pursuing that
 
05:20:02.030 --> 05:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
05:20:04.970 --> 05:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn which is more risky for the
 
05:20:08.628 --> 05:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
students well I think it's a yes and the
 
05:20:11.570 --> 05:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
thing I do most uh most often is the
 
05:20:12.708 --> 05:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
state director for Career Technical
 
05:20:15.770 --> 05:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
education and the types of Industry
 
05:20:17.448 --> 05:20:17.458 align:start position:0%
recognized credentials and badges that
 
05:20:20.090 --> 05:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
you described are absolutely something
 
05:20:23.590 --> 05:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
that the Career Technical lead programs
 
05:20:26.448 --> 05:20:26.458 align:start position:0%
are encouraging and are helping students
 
05:20:29.690 --> 05:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
to attain I think that that LinkedIn I
 
05:20:30.830 --> 05:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
only mention it because it's something
 
05:20:32.750 --> 05:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's fairly widely used but the intent
 
05:20:35.030 --> 05:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
is not to have it be limited to LinkedIn
 
05:20:38.990 --> 05:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
but rather to to limit it to things
 
05:20:41.628 --> 05:20:41.638 align:start position:0%
where students can curate and collect
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
and then share evidence of Readiness for
 
05:20:47.628 --> 05:20:47.638 align:start position:0%
employment so it's it's not something
 
05:20:50.990 --> 05:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
that says this is the LinkedIn act but
 
05:20:53.270 --> 05:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
rather this is the career development
 
05:20:56.208 --> 05:20:56.218 align:start position:0%
exploration conferencing curation
 
05:20:56.218 --> 05:20:57.830 align:start position:0%
exploration conferencing curation
Act

05:20:57.830 --> 05:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
Act
 
05:21:01.910 --> 05:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
so then they will if a school decided to
 
05:21:01.920 --> 05:21:04.128 align:start position:0%
so then they will if a school decided to
um

05:21:04.128 --> 05:21:04.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:06.530 --> 05:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
use one of these other
 
05:21:09.288 --> 05:21:09.298 align:start position:0%
they could do that would that would
 
05:21:09.298 --> 05:21:11.270 align:start position:0%
they could do that would that would
um

05:21:11.270 --> 05:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:15.170 --> 05:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
sorry lime brain not working
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
um this would apply to those as well yes
 
05:21:19.200 --> 05:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
um this would apply to those as well yes
so

05:21:20.840 --> 05:21:20.850 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:21:20.850 --> 05:21:22.250 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

05:21:22.250 --> 05:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:21:25.430 --> 05:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
um would a school or a CTE Center for
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
instance pick out an app
 
05:21:30.650 --> 05:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
like LinkedIn or another that they
 
05:21:33.350 --> 05:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to use for their
 
05:21:36.530 --> 05:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
students in that Center is that
 
05:21:41.390 --> 05:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
how you see it working yes okay
 
05:21:43.490 --> 05:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
um because I I don't have as much
 
05:21:45.350 --> 05:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
confidence as representative lakis in
 
05:21:48.650 --> 05:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
some of the digital badging systems
 
05:21:48.660 --> 05:21:50.208 align:start position:0%
some of the digital badging systems
um

05:21:50.208 --> 05:21:50.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:50.218 --> 05:21:51.730 align:start position:0%
um
um

05:21:51.730 --> 05:21:51.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:54.368 --> 05:21:54.378 align:start position:0%
with LinkedIn
 
05:21:58.628 --> 05:21:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:01.628 --> 05:22:01.638 align:start position:0%
going through this questionnaire and
 
05:22:04.868 --> 05:22:04.878 align:start position:0%
developing their competency
 
05:22:08.590 --> 05:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
for publication on LinkedIn
 
05:22:11.590 --> 05:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
would other
 
05:22:16.010 --> 05:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
s be able to provide a quote certificate
 
05:22:19.430 --> 05:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
or badge on LinkedIn or any of these
 
05:22:21.288 --> 05:22:21.298 align:start position:0%
other sites I'm just wondering who is
 
05:22:24.170 --> 05:22:24.180 align:start position:0%
going to have access to this besides the
 
05:22:24.180 --> 05:22:27.850 align:start position:0%
going to have access to this besides the
student

05:22:27.850 --> 05:22:27.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:30.948 --> 05:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
a little bit more sure
 
05:22:34.490 --> 05:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
um I think with some badging systems
 
05:22:36.830 --> 05:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
credentialing systems
 
05:22:40.490 --> 05:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
um a third party could say
 
05:22:40.500 --> 05:22:41.410 align:start position:0%
um a third party could say
um

05:22:41.410 --> 05:22:41.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:44.868 --> 05:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh the the student it could be for an
 
05:22:47.990 --> 05:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
outside program has earned a credential
 
05:22:53.350 --> 05:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
of such and such and posts that in that
 
05:22:56.270 --> 05:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
badging system
 
05:22:59.628 --> 05:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
um one of the security concerns I've
 
05:22:59.638 --> 05:23:01.070 align:start position:0%
um one of the security concerns I've
seen

05:23:01.070 --> 05:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
seen
 
05:23:01.080 --> 05:23:01.788 align:start position:0%
seen
um

05:23:01.788 --> 05:23:01.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:05.448 --> 05:23:05.458 align:start position:0%
is uh who are authorized users who you
 
05:23:09.170 --> 05:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
know uh it's in if third parties are
 
05:23:12.288 --> 05:23:12.298 align:start position:0%
allowed to post into the system
 
05:23:14.628 --> 05:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
um it's possible that they might post
 
05:23:16.490 --> 05:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
something that
 
05:23:19.368 --> 05:23:19.378 align:start position:0%
um is not favorable
 
05:23:22.128 --> 05:23:22.138 align:start position:0%
to the student
 
05:23:24.590 --> 05:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and that's one of you know my
 
05:23:27.350 --> 05:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
concerns I'm not sure in LinkedIn that
 
05:23:30.170 --> 05:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
there's any ability for anybody else to
 
05:23:32.810 --> 05:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
see anything I think the student would
 
05:23:34.788 --> 05:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
either have to be connected to the
 
05:23:37.970 --> 05:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
teacher for assessment to occur of the
 
05:23:40.368 --> 05:23:40.378 align:start position:0%
project right either the student is
 
05:23:42.890 --> 05:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
posting sort of privately and but
 
05:23:44.510 --> 05:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
they're connected to the teacher so the
 
05:23:46.670 --> 05:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
teacher can see their posts or the
 
05:23:48.890 --> 05:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
student is posting publicly and then
 
05:23:51.170 --> 05:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
anybody can see what's posted and what
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
what skills they've achieved but there
 
05:23:55.850 --> 05:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
are certainly other industry credentials
 
05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
which we wouldn't call social media and
 
05:23:59.150 --> 05:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
I think that's some of the confusion
 
05:24:02.390 --> 05:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
here is okay is there's other I'll give
 
05:24:04.730 --> 05:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
you an example so we have a CTE Center
 
05:24:08.448 --> 05:24:08.458 align:start position:0%
in Concord right um and we have not run
 
05:24:10.910 --> 05:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
into any application that we have not
 
05:24:12.708 --> 05:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
been able to obtain a data privacy
 
05:24:15.288 --> 05:24:15.298 align:start position:0%
agreement for under
 
05:24:17.750 --> 05:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
um HB 1612 which we all call it Center
 
05:24:20.330 --> 05:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
different RSA right she's dead it was
 
05:24:23.240 --> 05:24:23.250 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:23.250 --> 05:24:24.970 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:24:24.970 --> 05:24:24.980 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:24:31.490 --> 05:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
yeah 68a possibly 66 66 okay because I I
 
05:24:33.788 --> 05:24:33.798 align:start position:0%
had concerns about the
 
05:24:36.590 --> 05:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
68a which is the student online personal
 
05:24:39.948 --> 05:24:39.958 align:start position:0%
information yeah statute also
 
05:24:43.128 --> 05:24:43.138 align:start position:0%
um so uh for example we had a teacher
 
05:24:46.788 --> 05:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
asked me for uh welding credentials so
 
05:24:49.730 --> 05:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
it's an adult oriented
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a career oriented
 
05:24:51.840 --> 05:24:53.510 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a career oriented
credential

05:24:53.510 --> 05:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
credential
 
05:24:56.270 --> 05:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
um and uh we didn't have a data privacy
 
05:24:58.670 --> 05:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
agreement but I reached out to the
 
05:25:00.590 --> 05:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
company so many states are jumping on
 
05:25:03.470 --> 05:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
board now I had a DPA within two weeks
 
05:25:06.288 --> 05:25:06.298 align:start position:0%
with that company so we really have
 
05:25:08.330 --> 05:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
found that really just sort of doing the
 
05:25:10.368 --> 05:25:10.378 align:start position:0%
legwork and digging in and trying to get
 
05:25:12.470 --> 05:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
a data privacy agreement is our
 
05:25:15.650 --> 05:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
preferred first step and it has worked
 
05:25:18.530 --> 05:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
you know over 1300 times so this is
 
05:25:21.170 --> 05:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
getting easier and easier to do
 
05:25:22.550 --> 05:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
um a platform
 
05:25:24.650 --> 05:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
like LinkedIn
 
05:25:24.660 --> 05:25:25.368 align:start position:0%
like LinkedIn
um

05:25:25.368 --> 05:25:25.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:28.368 --> 05:25:28.378 align:start position:0%
this particular RSA because LinkedIn is
 
05:25:30.350 --> 05:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
social media and this RSA is mostly
 
05:25:32.448 --> 05:25:32.458 align:start position:0%
about social media investigations right
 
05:25:35.030 --> 05:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
and protecting students privacy so
 
05:25:37.430 --> 05:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
there's some mixing and um
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
I would caution to be um to avoid
 
05:25:43.310 --> 05:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
confusion between the data privacy RSA
 
05:25:45.650 --> 05:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
and the social media RSA because they
 
05:25:47.868 --> 05:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
really have two different purposes so
 
05:25:49.070 --> 05:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
just from the school district's
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
perspective I think there could be
 
05:25:52.190 --> 05:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
confusion if you have to look into two
 
05:25:55.128 --> 05:25:55.138 align:start position:0%
different rsas to think about data
 
05:25:57.050 --> 05:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
privacy agreements you know data privacy
 
05:26:10.070 --> 05:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:10.080 --> 05:26:16.128 align:start position:0%
 
yesterday

05:26:16.128 --> 05:26:16.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:18.288 --> 05:26:18.298 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned you know going the
 
05:26:20.270 --> 05:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
other beyond the LinkedIn I know in
 
05:26:23.510 --> 05:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard about Adobe that has
 
05:26:25.128 --> 05:26:25.138 align:start position:0%
not that's just a tool right that's
 
05:26:28.070 --> 05:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
you're correct but is that one data
 
05:26:30.948 --> 05:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
privacy agreement with on Adobe
 
05:26:32.810 --> 05:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
um we do not have a data privacy
 
05:26:34.730 --> 05:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
agreement with Adobe there's a handful
 
05:26:37.850 --> 05:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
of very large companies that will not
 
05:26:40.788 --> 05:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
give us data privacy agreements but we
 
05:26:44.208 --> 05:26:44.218 align:start position:0%
use the security standards so as as part
 
05:26:47.090 --> 05:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
of the law the state department of
 
05:26:48.470 --> 05:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
education has developed security
 
05:26:50.690 --> 05:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
standards by which we need to evaluate
 
05:26:53.030 --> 05:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
so the law doesn't say we have to have a
 
05:26:55.070 --> 05:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
data privacy agreement the law says that
 
05:26:57.530 --> 05:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
the the companies the vendors need to
 
05:26:59.930 --> 05:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
meet these security standards we have
 
05:27:02.690 --> 05:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
evaluated Adobe and Google is another
 
05:27:04.430 --> 05:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
one there's no data privacy agreement
 
05:27:06.890 --> 05:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
with Google either we do have one with
 
05:27:06.900 --> 05:27:08.510 align:start position:0%
with Google either we do have one with
Microsoft

05:27:08.510 --> 05:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
Microsoft
 
05:27:08.520 --> 05:27:09.190 align:start position:0%
Microsoft
um

05:27:09.190 --> 05:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:12.530 --> 05:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
that so we have evaluated those products
 
05:27:15.830 --> 05:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
against the security standards and they
 
05:27:17.868 --> 05:27:17.878 align:start position:0%
hold enough industry security standards
 
05:27:20.628 --> 05:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
for example the Department of Defense
 
05:27:22.128 --> 05:27:22.138 align:start position:0%
uses Adobe
 
05:27:24.650 --> 05:27:24.660 align:start position:0%
um you know we have enough evidence that
 
05:27:26.810 --> 05:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
they're fairly secure to feel pretty
 
05:27:29.930 --> 05:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
confident in using them thanks thank you
 
05:27:32.090 --> 05:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
it was interesting
 
05:27:32.100 --> 05:27:32.890 align:start position:0%
it was interesting
um

05:27:32.890 --> 05:27:32.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:36.350 --> 05:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
189 68a the student online personal
 
05:27:40.750 --> 05:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
information when I put that bill forward
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
Microsoft supported the legislation but
 
05:27:46.550 --> 05:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
there was a Consortium
 
05:27:50.090 --> 05:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
including Google opposed to the
 
05:27:52.910 --> 05:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
legislation so it was yeah it was quite
 
05:27:52.920 --> 05:27:53.990 align:start position:0%
legislation so it was yeah it was quite
interesting

05:27:53.990 --> 05:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
05:27:56.330 --> 05:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
uh representative Lucas
 
05:27:58.310 --> 05:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
05:28:00.708 --> 05:28:00.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:28:05.690 --> 05:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
do we need to be using social media
 
05:28:11.090 --> 05:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
for badging when we have those industry
 
05:28:11.100 --> 05:28:12.590 align:start position:0%
for badging when we have those industry
um

05:28:12.590 --> 05:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call application
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:20.510 --> 05:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
um that will do that
 
05:28:24.110 --> 05:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
that it's a completely you know it's not
 
05:28:26.270 --> 05:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
social media and do we actually need to
 
05:28:29.208 --> 05:28:29.218 align:start position:0%
be using social media or can we just be
 
05:28:31.550 --> 05:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
using those other things which doesn't
 
05:28:33.830 --> 05:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
even need this at all because it's not
 
05:28:36.410 --> 05:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
social media it's an excellent question
 
05:28:38.390 --> 05:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
I I think um and this is where I would
 
05:28:41.150 --> 05:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
defer to pan because they but my take is
 
05:28:42.650 --> 05:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
that as someone who works in career
 
05:28:45.350 --> 05:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
development I see increasingly uh
 
05:28:48.830 --> 05:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
resumes going in increasingly in the
 
05:28:51.890 --> 05:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
electronic uh form where there's a
 
05:28:53.208 --> 05:28:53.218 align:start position:0%
little bit of a hybrid right now where
 
05:28:55.850 --> 05:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
someone will email a a resume as an
 
05:28:58.070 --> 05:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
attachment but I suppose my concern
 
05:29:00.890 --> 05:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
would be does that limit the reach of a
 
05:29:05.030 --> 05:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
um a young job Seeker if curating
 
05:29:07.310 --> 05:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
um experience is is happening more on
 
05:29:09.230 --> 05:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
these sorts of platforms but I would I
 
05:29:11.448 --> 05:29:11.458 align:start position:0%
would defer to Pam for the rest of the
 
05:29:12.830 --> 05:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
answer I would say we're talking about
 
05:29:15.708 --> 05:29:15.718 align:start position:0%
two different purposes there there is a
 
05:29:17.930 --> 05:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
credentialing badging purpose
 
05:29:20.448 --> 05:29:20.458 align:start position:0%
um students who receive a credential in
 
05:29:24.050 --> 05:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
automotive technology or welding right
 
05:29:26.750 --> 05:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
and and by the way we still do get
 
05:29:28.310 --> 05:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
parent permission for those because
 
05:29:30.350 --> 05:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
there's usually a fee involved in all of
 
05:29:30.360 --> 05:29:31.490 align:start position:0%
there's usually a fee involved in all of
that

05:29:31.490 --> 05:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:29:33.770 --> 05:29:33.780 align:start position:0%
um then there's the sort of how you
 
05:29:36.850 --> 05:29:36.860 align:start position:0%
teach students how to go look for jobs
 
05:29:40.010 --> 05:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
so that's you know I think where
 
05:29:42.708 --> 05:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn falls into the bucket of we're
 
05:29:45.288 --> 05:29:45.298 align:start position:0%
going to teach them how to use the most
 
05:29:47.570 --> 05:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
prevalent social media platform which
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
people are actively using to go out and
 
05:29:52.970 --> 05:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
find jobs and how to navigate that I
 
05:29:54.530 --> 05:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
think those are skills they want to
 
05:29:56.510 --> 05:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
teach the students
 
05:29:56.520 --> 05:29:57.250 align:start position:0%
teach the students
um

05:29:57.250 --> 05:29:57.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:59.690 --> 05:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
uh you know so I really think there are
 
05:30:01.010 --> 05:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
two different
 
05:30:03.470 --> 05:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
um two different buckets and it is what
 
05:30:05.930 --> 05:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
makes it so confusing in terms of the
 
05:30:09.410 --> 05:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
data privacy laws how we how we treat
 
05:30:12.110 --> 05:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
um social media like LinkedIn
 
05:30:14.390 --> 05:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and then my other question I
 
05:30:17.330 --> 05:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
don't know if you saw the amendment by
 
05:30:21.530 --> 05:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters which talks about
 
05:30:26.448 --> 05:30:26.458 align:start position:0%
um clear career exploration or or CTE
 
05:30:26.458 --> 05:30:27.110 align:start position:0%
um clear career exploration or or CTE
um

05:30:27.110 --> 05:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:29.690 --> 05:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
using technology platforms and whatever
 
05:30:31.910 --> 05:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
and having parental
 
05:30:34.490 --> 05:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
but that's not social media either yeah
 
05:30:34.500 --> 05:30:35.868 align:start position:0%
but that's not social media either yeah
so

05:30:35.868 --> 05:30:35.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:37.910 --> 05:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
we don't actually need that Amendment
 
05:30:39.910 --> 05:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
right because
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
Jewish and I have a strong opinion about
 
05:30:46.490 --> 05:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
that um I think we've since we've done a
 
05:30:48.470 --> 05:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
lot of work with the uh groups that
 
05:30:50.990 --> 05:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
developed the original
 
05:30:55.368 --> 05:30:55.378 align:start position:0%
um Bill and um that makes some sense I
 
05:30:57.910 --> 05:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
think it was just a one sentence um bill
 
05:31:01.550 --> 05:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
but um the amendment I think is where it
 
05:31:03.350 --> 05:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
introduces a lot of confusion between
 
05:31:05.448 --> 05:31:05.458 align:start position:0%
the data Privacy Law it's not
 
05:31:07.010 --> 05:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
necessarily about social media
 
05:31:09.948 --> 05:31:09.958 align:start position:0%
personally I feel I feel I think Josh
 
05:31:12.470 --> 05:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
agrees that it's in the wrong place
 
05:31:15.650 --> 05:31:15.660 align:start position:0%
um we would be more than happy to work
 
05:31:19.368 --> 05:31:19.378 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Ed and and
 
05:31:21.350 --> 05:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
um whoever would like to sponsor an
 
05:31:24.050 --> 05:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
amendment next year to really look at
 
05:31:26.030 --> 05:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
you know I agree that when it comes to
 
05:31:28.430 --> 05:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
CTE programs there might be some
 
05:31:30.350 --> 05:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
exceptions we need to make in the data
 
05:31:33.410 --> 05:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
Privacy Law but wouldn't it be nice if
 
05:31:35.150 --> 05:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
those exceptions were in the data
 
05:31:37.850 --> 05:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
privacy RSA not the social media right
 
05:31:40.128 --> 05:31:40.138 align:start position:0%
because it's not social media
 
05:31:42.350 --> 05:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
um we've been doing leg work if we hear
 
05:31:46.190 --> 05:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
of a particular tool that in any any CTE
 
05:31:49.128 --> 05:31:49.138 align:start position:0%
program has not been approved
 
05:31:50.810 --> 05:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
um we'll jump in and do some leg work
 
05:31:52.490 --> 05:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
we've been calling companies we've been
 
05:31:54.350 --> 05:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
doing everything we can to try to help
 
05:31:56.930 --> 05:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
push those through the reality is local
 
05:31:56.940 --> 05:31:58.670 align:start position:0%
push those through the reality is local
control

05:31:58.670 --> 05:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
control
 
05:32:00.770 --> 05:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
I can't tell an I.T director in another
 
05:32:02.990 --> 05:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
District how to run their District right
 
05:32:05.570 --> 05:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
or what risk they're willing to assume
 
05:32:07.250 --> 05:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
for their students
 
05:32:09.708 --> 05:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
so we have some that are more
 
05:32:12.650 --> 05:32:12.660 align:start position:0%
restrictive than I might be I'll go get
 
05:32:15.830 --> 05:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
prayer permission for some tools but I
 
05:32:18.830 --> 05:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
think that um I think that data privacy
 
05:32:21.350 --> 05:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
laws are pretty good as they are now I
 
05:32:23.810 --> 05:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
think we need to work out some we've
 
05:32:25.490 --> 05:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
offered Jeff our help we need to work
 
05:32:27.830 --> 05:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
out some specific products and see what
 
05:32:29.810 --> 05:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
we can do but
 
05:32:32.868 --> 05:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that that amendment is a
 
05:32:35.150 --> 05:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
great fit in the social media right
 
05:32:37.430 --> 05:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
because it's not social media so I'd be
 
05:32:39.590 --> 05:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
willing to work with you on that for
 
05:32:43.448 --> 05:32:43.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:46.010 --> 05:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
yes but what about this year
 
05:32:49.430 --> 05:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know uh I mean are we it's not
 
05:32:52.430 --> 05:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
against the lawn yeah yeah
 
05:32:55.610 --> 05:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
it's not covered under the social media
 
05:32:57.948 --> 05:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
uh law at all
 
05:33:00.170 --> 05:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
because it's not social media
 
05:33:02.510 --> 05:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
I think the original our the original
 
05:33:06.170 --> 05:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
bill was one sentence correct
 
05:33:06.180 --> 05:33:09.310 align:start position:0%
bill was one sentence correct
estimate

05:33:09.310 --> 05:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:11.930 --> 05:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
yeah so we don't know
 
05:33:11.940 --> 05:33:15.350 align:start position:0%
yeah so we don't know
right

05:33:15.350 --> 05:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:21.230 --> 05:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:24.830 --> 05:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
law and at the Second Step this
 
05:33:27.230 --> 05:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
definition shall not apply to platform
 
05:33:29.810 --> 05:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
reviews for demonstrating evidence in
 
05:33:35.230 --> 05:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:37.910 --> 05:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes Revenge Belcher
 
05:33:39.350 --> 05:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
05:33:41.330 --> 05:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to drill
 
05:33:43.850 --> 05:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
down a little deeper on the exact nature
 
05:33:45.590 --> 05:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
of these certifications that are
 
05:33:47.990 --> 05:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
available and and whatnot because I
 
05:33:49.490 --> 05:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
think that'll help clarify things with
 
05:33:51.230 --> 05:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
people a little bit
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
um and let's use Adobe as an example so
 
05:33:56.810 --> 05:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
when a student in school goes through a
 
05:33:59.448 --> 05:33:59.458 align:start position:0%
period of instruction in Adobe
 
05:34:01.788 --> 05:34:01.798 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken he is he or she is
 
05:34:04.610 --> 05:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
then able to take through Adobe at their
 
05:34:07.850 --> 05:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
school various testing to obtain a
 
05:34:11.270 --> 05:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
certification in that adobe platform yes
 
05:34:13.430 --> 05:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
and then that that is the if I'm not
 
05:34:16.250 --> 05:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
mistaken the industry standard for that
 
05:34:19.010 --> 05:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
is the certification direct from Adobe
 
05:34:20.510 --> 05:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
there may or may not be badging
 
05:34:21.830 --> 05:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
available for that right now I'm not
 
05:34:23.270 --> 05:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
sure I if there's not there probably
 
05:34:24.288 --> 05:34:24.298 align:start position:0%
will be
 
05:34:27.650 --> 05:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to LinkedIn and I
 
05:34:28.970 --> 05:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
don't mean to keep picking on LinkedIn
 
05:34:30.288 --> 05:34:30.298 align:start position:0%
but they're like the big one right now
 
05:34:32.270 --> 05:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
and they've got this all put together
 
05:34:34.850 --> 05:34:34.860 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just it's just quizzes
 
05:34:37.550 --> 05:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
that you take so it's not it's not a
 
05:34:39.948 --> 05:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
industry standard certification it's
 
05:34:44.030 --> 05:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
just a a brief example that lets them a
 
05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
potential employer know that maybe you
 
05:34:49.368 --> 05:34:49.378 align:start position:0%
know something and I say maybe because
 
05:34:51.590 --> 05:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
in my research I saw lots of examples of
 
05:34:54.650 --> 05:34:54.660 align:start position:0%
people using AI chat GPT to actually
 
05:34:57.830 --> 05:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
fit these tests yeah you're right I I
 
05:35:00.050 --> 05:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
just took a bunch of those quizzes for
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
fun the other weekend and you know I'd
 
05:35:04.970 --> 05:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
take a cyber security quiz it was 15
 
05:35:08.390 --> 05:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
questions I'd go through it I passed but
 
05:35:09.890 --> 05:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
it's not the same as going out and
 
05:35:12.470 --> 05:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
getting the industry standard where I go
 
05:35:14.448 --> 05:35:14.458 align:start position:0%
to Pearson Testing Center and get the
 
05:35:17.270 --> 05:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
actual you know credentials so they're
 
05:35:20.030 --> 05:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
pretty light yes and just a brief I'm
 
05:35:21.708 --> 05:35:21.718 align:start position:0%
sorry if I may there's nothing in
 
05:35:23.448 --> 05:35:23.458 align:start position:0%
current law that would prohibit or make
 
05:35:25.910 --> 05:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
it difficult for students to obtain the
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
industry standard Adobe certification in
 
05:35:32.030 --> 05:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
school right now we approached that with
 
05:35:34.490 --> 05:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
um we do ask for parent permission
 
05:35:37.610 --> 05:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
usually a fee is involved and so you
 
05:35:38.990 --> 05:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
know we sort of approach it that way
 
05:35:41.030 --> 05:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
make sure the parents are on board thank
 
05:35:43.610 --> 05:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
you um you know there's a number of
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:50.810 --> 05:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
so in the example you just gave in that
 
05:35:54.250 --> 05:35:54.260 align:start position:0%
credential for the cyber security
 
05:35:57.410 --> 05:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
would was the company Pearson you
 
05:35:59.810 --> 05:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
mentioned well Pearson runs the testing
 
05:36:02.510 --> 05:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
center oh it could be like a cissp would
 
05:36:05.990 --> 05:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
be one certification yes right would a
 
05:36:07.368 --> 05:36:07.378 align:start position:0%
student be able to add that
 
05:36:09.410 --> 05:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
certification to their LinkedIn account
 
05:36:12.410 --> 05:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
to their profile they yes they can just
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
write it in yes okay yeah right yeah
 
05:36:17.040 --> 05:36:19.750 align:start position:0%
write it in yes okay yeah right yeah
um

05:36:19.750 --> 05:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:23.530 --> 05:36:23.540 align:start position:0%
would the student control who has access
 
05:36:27.708 --> 05:36:27.718 align:start position:0%
to view their LinkedIn account
 
05:36:27.718 --> 05:36:29.330 align:start position:0%
to view their LinkedIn account
yes

05:36:29.330 --> 05:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:36:33.050 --> 05:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
yes and as as with most social media you
 
05:36:35.570 --> 05:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
can connect with people and you can
 
05:36:37.368 --> 05:36:37.378 align:start position:0%
decide whether your posts are viewable
 
05:36:39.890 --> 05:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
by the people you're connected to or
 
05:36:43.368 --> 05:36:43.378 align:start position:0%
whether they're public posts okay
 
05:36:45.350 --> 05:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
so that would be the connection to the
 
05:36:47.448 --> 05:36:47.458 align:start position:0%
teacher you mentioned yeah so it's kind
 
05:36:48.830 --> 05:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
of a weird
 
05:36:51.830 --> 05:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
um is you can look it up two ways one is
 
05:36:53.930 --> 05:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
if they're connected to the teacher that
 
05:36:56.150 --> 05:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
might not be desirable because they're
 
05:36:57.708 --> 05:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
connected to the teacher then they can
 
05:37:00.470 --> 05:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
instant message the teacher Etc
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
um however
 
05:37:03.830 --> 05:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
um you may not want their post to be
 
05:37:05.810 --> 05:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
public they could easily make a mistake
 
05:37:07.250 --> 05:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
that could haunt them for their whole
 
05:37:09.650 --> 05:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
careers or it could be a good thing kind
 
05:37:12.288 --> 05:37:12.298 align:start position:0%
of want to guide them in that so
 
05:37:12.298 --> 05:37:13.128 align:start position:0%
of want to guide them in that so
um

05:37:13.128 --> 05:37:13.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:15.288 --> 05:37:15.298 align:start position:0%
we we've been talking a lot about that
 
05:37:17.448 --> 05:37:17.458 align:start position:0%
and I think I would prefer that the
 
05:37:19.128 --> 05:37:19.138 align:start position:0%
students make public posts so they're
 
05:37:20.750 --> 05:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
not actually directly connected to the
 
05:37:23.030 --> 05:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
teacher and then then at the end of the
 
05:37:24.708 --> 05:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
course they're guided on how to make
 
05:37:27.170 --> 05:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
their posts private how to move it from
 
05:37:28.670 --> 05:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
a school email address to a personal
 
05:37:38.350 --> 05:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:41.810 --> 05:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
financially for the account or a school
 
05:37:43.670 --> 05:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
email address
 
05:37:46.190 --> 05:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's a decision Point we've we've
 
05:37:47.810 --> 05:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
determined we've been talking with our
 
05:37:50.270 --> 05:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys that work with us we've
 
05:37:51.650 --> 05:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
determined that if they use their
 
05:37:54.970 --> 05:37:54.980 align:start position:0%
personal email address the way um RSA
 
05:37:58.010 --> 05:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
18970 is written right now it would be a
 
05:37:59.810 --> 05:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
personal social media account so that's
 
05:38:02.090 --> 05:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
probably not desirable but if they use a
 
05:38:03.830 --> 05:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
school email address then it's not a
 
05:38:06.288 --> 05:38:06.298 align:start position:0%
personal social media account
 
05:38:10.550 --> 05:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
um so that is sort of one point of
 
05:38:13.128 --> 05:38:13.138 align:start position:0%
of contention we do want the kids to
 
05:38:15.288 --> 05:38:15.298 align:start position:0%
take their profiles with them so we
 
05:38:16.788 --> 05:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
would want them to leave school with it
 
05:38:20.230 --> 05:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
under their personal account
 
05:38:20.240 --> 05:38:22.070 align:start position:0%
under their personal account
you

05:38:22.070 --> 05:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:38:25.430 --> 05:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
change the account when they graduated
 
05:38:28.430 --> 05:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
yes it's easy enough to do yeah
 
05:38:32.030 --> 05:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
lives in Belgium thank you um so if it's
 
05:38:33.948 --> 05:38:33.958 align:start position:0%
not if it's not a personal uh account if
 
05:38:37.010 --> 05:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
it's a a school account
 
05:38:38.570 --> 05:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
um and there are minor
 
05:38:41.690 --> 05:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
what liability might the school have if
 
05:38:46.070 --> 05:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:48.948 --> 05:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
um that's an excellent point because we
 
05:38:51.650 --> 05:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
don't have a data privacy agreement we
 
05:38:53.510 --> 05:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
are completely bound
 
05:38:55.670 --> 05:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
actually the student is completely Bound
 
05:38:58.010 --> 05:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
by the terms of agreement with the
 
05:38:58.020 --> 05:38:58.910 align:start position:0%
by the terms of agreement with the
company

05:38:58.910 --> 05:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
company
 
05:39:02.090 --> 05:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
so there's a number of areas if you've
 
05:39:04.610 --> 05:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
got a bright 15 year old student who
 
05:39:06.590 --> 05:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
happens to be in junior level classes
 
05:39:10.310 --> 05:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
with 17 year olds you can't allow them
 
05:39:13.610 --> 05:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
to do LinkedIn because the terms of use
 
05:39:17.330 --> 05:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
is 16. so anyway there's a number of of
 
05:39:19.430 --> 05:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
areas where that might apply but the the
 
05:39:21.110 --> 05:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
fact is you just have no control over
 
05:39:22.490 --> 05:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
the terms of service the company
 
05:39:24.708 --> 05:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
controls that and they could change at
 
05:39:26.948 --> 05:39:26.958 align:start position:0%
any time
 
05:39:29.628 --> 05:39:29.638 align:start position:0%
yeah so it does make us a little nervous
 
05:39:31.310 --> 05:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
because there's sort of that lack of
 
05:39:33.650 --> 05:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
most platforms that we use with kids and
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know Concord we have over 300
 
05:39:37.788 --> 05:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
different tools that we use with kids
 
05:39:39.708 --> 05:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
that are approved
 
05:39:41.810 --> 05:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
we like to have some control over those
 
05:39:41.820 --> 05:39:43.430 align:start position:0%
we like to have some control over those
accounts

05:39:43.430 --> 05:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
05:39:46.128 --> 05:39:46.138 align:start position:0%
um for data privacy purposes if there's
 
05:39:48.230 --> 05:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
a data breach we have certain laws that
 
05:39:51.970 --> 05:39:51.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:54.350 --> 05:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
nursing Hall thank you yeah yeah I'll
 
05:39:56.570 --> 05:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
just take a note the a lot of stress on
 
05:39:58.190 --> 05:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
this whole thing is on the teacher I
 
05:40:00.530 --> 05:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
mean I taught technology for yeah for
 
05:40:02.750 --> 05:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
many many years and
 
05:40:02.760 --> 05:40:03.350 align:start position:0%
many many years and
um

05:40:03.350 --> 05:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:06.110 --> 05:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
yeah you know what kids do but at some
 
05:40:08.510 --> 05:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
point kids got to be able to do it and
 
05:40:09.770 --> 05:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
that's the bottom line and you have to
 
05:40:11.150 --> 05:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
but the teacher assumes a lot of
 
05:40:12.470 --> 05:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility particularly if they're
 
05:40:15.110 --> 05:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
young I mean I I did Adobe the whole
 
05:40:18.050 --> 05:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
Adobe suite to middle schoolers and you
 
05:40:20.570 --> 05:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
do have to watch what they're doing and
 
05:40:22.610 --> 05:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
um but you can't stop them from doing it
 
05:40:24.230 --> 05:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
you can stop them but you shouldn't stop
 
05:40:26.350 --> 05:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
them right I guess what I want to say so
 
05:40:30.410 --> 05:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
Josh I don't do a risk everything has a
 
05:40:32.990 --> 05:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
risk and I think we can't be dinosaurs
 
05:40:36.948 --> 05:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah uh Josh wanted me to point
 
05:40:39.410 --> 05:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
out that you know under FERPA which is
 
05:40:41.448 --> 05:40:41.458 align:start position:0%
the primary Privacy Law that we operate
 
05:40:43.490 --> 05:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
federally with
 
05:40:45.948 --> 05:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
um we do schools have the right to
 
05:40:47.810 --> 05:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
exercise the school official exception
 
05:40:51.350 --> 05:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
and um you know obtain parent permission
 
05:40:54.288 --> 05:40:54.298 align:start position:0%
for things like this if if we were to do
 
05:40:56.690 --> 05:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
something like LinkedIn and a parent did
 
05:40:59.270 --> 05:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
not opt into it and the student wasn't
 
05:41:01.610 --> 05:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
18 we would have to find an alternative
 
05:41:05.690 --> 05:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:05.700 --> 05:41:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:41:08.390 --> 05:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:41:10.368 --> 05:41:10.378 align:start position:0%
that was something I had a question
 
05:41:12.708 --> 05:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
about the alternatives for students who
 
05:41:15.708 --> 05:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
don't participate would these students
 
05:41:18.170 --> 05:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
be at a disadvantage if their classmates
 
05:41:19.970 --> 05:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
get these industry credentials and are
 
05:41:21.948 --> 05:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
able to advertise them on LinkedIn or
 
05:41:23.690 --> 05:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
other platforms what about the other
 
05:41:23.700 --> 05:41:25.310 align:start position:0%
other platforms what about the other
classmates

05:41:25.310 --> 05:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
classmates
 
05:41:27.708 --> 05:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
that is always the case you strive for
 
05:41:29.628 --> 05:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
equity and
 
05:41:29.638 --> 05:41:30.410 align:start position:0%
equity and
um

05:41:30.410 --> 05:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:32.810 --> 05:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that there's other ways that
 
05:41:34.788 --> 05:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
they can do it they could do like a
 
05:41:36.770 --> 05:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
Google site or something but it's not
 
05:41:38.330 --> 05:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
the same you're not connecting with
 
05:41:40.970 --> 05:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
those industry partners
 
05:41:42.530 --> 05:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:41:46.070 --> 05:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
you know the students can by law go out
 
05:41:47.750 --> 05:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
and create their own LinkedIn accounts
 
05:41:50.510 --> 05:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
too you know they don't need parent
 
05:41:52.670 --> 05:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
permission even because the age of
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
consent is 13 right under Copa federally
 
05:41:58.850 --> 05:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:42:00.770 --> 05:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
um kids can do it on their own it's just
 
05:42:02.330 --> 05:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
I think the question is having the
 
05:42:05.270 --> 05:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
school direct the kids to do it is a
 
05:42:11.030 --> 05:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:14.750 --> 05:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
um I think a lot of the schools
 
05:42:17.208 --> 05:42:17.218 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire use a product called
 
05:42:20.448 --> 05:42:20.458 align:start position:0%
I think it's PowerSchool yes
 
05:42:22.550 --> 05:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
um and I think the parent company
 
05:42:24.530 --> 05:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure it's directly through
 
05:42:27.530 --> 05:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh PowerSchool or another one of their
 
05:42:31.128 --> 05:42:31.138 align:start position:0%
affiliate projects products does have a
 
05:42:32.990 --> 05:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
credentialing or badging
 
05:42:34.910 --> 05:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
capability to it
 
05:42:37.730 --> 05:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of products yeah so they
 
05:42:40.368 --> 05:42:40.378 align:start position:0%
probably do right yeah because that's
 
05:42:43.010 --> 05:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
one I've seen mentioned in regard to
 
05:42:46.250 --> 05:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
some of these safety concerns
 
05:42:51.770 --> 05:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
um which would CTE centers be using
 
05:42:54.050 --> 05:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
well let's say if the school X already
 
05:42:58.490 --> 05:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
has power school would they be using the
 
05:43:01.550 --> 05:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
CTE Center for that school would they be
 
05:43:01.560 --> 05:43:03.170 align:start position:0%
CTE Center for that school would they be
using

05:43:03.170 --> 05:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
using
 
05:43:06.430 --> 05:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh product from the PowerSchool company
 
05:43:08.890 --> 05:43:08.900 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
05:43:12.590 --> 05:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
instead of LinkedIn possibly I I guess
 
05:43:14.030 --> 05:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
it's possible
 
05:43:16.070 --> 05:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
um the truth about that company's
 
05:43:18.410 --> 05:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
products is they're very expensive so
 
05:43:21.050 --> 05:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
not a lot of schools have a lot of the
 
05:43:24.110 --> 05:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
other products in this week because they
 
05:43:26.690 --> 05:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
have a lot there's probably 20 different
 
05:43:29.390 --> 05:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
products that they offer I'm not sure of
 
05:43:31.610 --> 05:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
the one that you're referring to but I
 
05:43:33.288 --> 05:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
know that when we look at any of their
 
05:43:34.970 --> 05:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
products we're looking at
 
05:43:37.190 --> 05:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
very expensive products so we don't
 
05:43:39.770 --> 05:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
necessarily purchase them I would say
 
05:43:41.930 --> 05:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
too representative cordelli that my main
 
05:43:43.430 --> 05:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
concern is I want to make sure that
 
05:43:44.868 --> 05:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
students have something that's real
 
05:43:48.170 --> 05:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
world and authentic and many of these uh
 
05:43:49.850 --> 05:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
products that are designed to be used in
 
05:43:51.948 --> 05:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
schools may not be recognized by
 
05:43:54.410 --> 05:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
employers so that's something I always
 
05:43:56.090 --> 05:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
want to keep front of mind is is this
 
05:43:58.850 --> 05:43:58.860 align:start position:0%
something that truly is as for the Adobe
 
05:44:00.948 --> 05:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
that had come up a couple times is the
 
05:44:02.750 --> 05:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
industry standard and recognized by
 
05:44:05.570 --> 05:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
potential employers right and that's
 
05:44:07.810 --> 05:44:07.820 align:start position:0%
partially where some of my
 
05:44:10.910 --> 05:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
original concerns came into play with
 
05:44:12.548 --> 05:44:12.558 align:start position:0%
the student online personal information
 
05:44:16.990 --> 05:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
RSA because it's designed for
 
05:44:20.990 --> 05:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
products designed and marketed for K-12
 
05:44:26.708 --> 05:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
purposes yes which so LinkedIn would not
 
05:44:29.330 --> 05:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
fall underneath this
 
05:44:33.948 --> 05:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
statute but a power school
 
05:44:37.390 --> 05:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
um my I think that's that particular
 
05:44:39.708 --> 05:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
designation has been a point of
 
05:44:39.718 --> 05:44:41.448 align:start position:0%
designation has been a point of
confusion

05:44:41.448 --> 05:44:41.458 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
um that might be worth clarifying in a
 
05:44:45.948 --> 05:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
future year with some stronger language
 
05:44:48.230 --> 05:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
because each district again sets their
 
05:44:50.510 --> 05:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
own level of risk and so for some
 
05:44:52.788 --> 05:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
districts it's just easier to say no
 
05:44:56.690 --> 05:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:56.700 --> 05:44:59.930 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:44:59.930 --> 05:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:02.930 --> 05:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:45:02.940 --> 05:45:05.090 align:start position:0%
further questions
um

05:45:05.090 --> 05:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:07.670 --> 05:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
I thought I might
 
05:45:07.680 --> 05:45:09.230 align:start position:0%
I thought I might
um

05:45:09.230 --> 05:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:10.788 --> 05:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
send you
 
05:45:10.798 --> 05:45:11.868 align:start position:0%
send you
um

05:45:11.868 --> 05:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:14.570 --> 05:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
maybe for your review
 
05:45:17.990 --> 05:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I had a briefing paper that talked
 
05:45:20.150 --> 05:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
about legal issues
 
05:45:23.470 --> 05:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
with some of the FERPA and Copa Etc
 
05:45:27.288 --> 05:45:27.298 align:start position:0%
maybe just for you to review and we
 
05:45:27.298 --> 05:45:28.070 align:start position:0%
maybe just for you to review and we
could

05:45:28.070 --> 05:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:45:30.288 --> 05:45:30.298 align:start position:0%
um you know get back together again and
 
05:45:32.770 --> 05:45:32.780 align:start position:0%
maybe talk about
 
05:45:38.530 --> 05:45:38.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:42.190 --> 05:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and talks more about
 
05:45:45.590 --> 05:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald's Amendment and
 
05:45:49.128 --> 05:45:49.138 align:start position:0%
talk about a specific language
 
05:45:49.138 --> 05:45:52.610 align:start position:0%
talk about a specific language
mm-hmm

05:45:52.610 --> 05:45:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:52.620 --> 05:45:54.368 align:start position:0%
 
this

05:45:54.368 --> 05:45:54.378 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:45:57.530 --> 05:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any comments for right
 
05:46:00.250 --> 05:46:00.260 align:start position:0%
now yeah excellent yeah
 
05:46:02.628 --> 05:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Jeff
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
um does Concord have in the school
 
05:46:07.970 --> 05:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
district any policies in place
 
05:46:10.310 --> 05:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
which are addressing currently what
 
05:46:11.810 --> 05:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
we're trying to look at in legislation
 
05:46:14.500 --> 05:46:14.510 align:start position:0%
right now social media policies
 
05:46:14.510 --> 05:46:15.048 align:start position:0%
right now social media policies
[Music]

05:46:15.048 --> 05:46:15.058 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:46:15.058 --> 05:46:15.830 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:46:15.830 --> 05:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:18.230 --> 05:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
yeah we do have so
 
05:46:21.410 --> 05:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
RSA 18970 is really about protecting
 
05:46:24.288 --> 05:46:24.298 align:start position:0%
students during investigations so yes we
 
05:46:27.590 --> 05:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
would have a policy that is based off of
 
05:46:27.600 --> 05:46:28.610 align:start position:0%
would have a policy that is based off of
that

05:46:28.610 --> 05:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:46:30.770 --> 05:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
um in the district I'm not sure of the
 
05:46:32.990 --> 05:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
exact number of the policy but most
 
05:46:35.090 --> 05:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
districts do I'm also a school board
 
05:46:38.030 --> 05:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
member in a different District so those
 
05:46:40.010 --> 05:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
are policies that I have definitely seen
 
05:46:41.868 --> 05:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
before yes
 
05:46:41.878 --> 05:46:49.270 align:start position:0%
before yes
so

05:46:49.270 --> 05:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:52.610 --> 05:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
agreement that would have to be
 
05:46:58.070 --> 05:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:58.080 --> 05:47:00.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:47:00.590 --> 05:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:47:02.150 --> 05:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
um you're talking about General data
 
05:47:02.160 --> 05:47:03.410 align:start position:0%
um you're talking about General data
privacy

05:47:03.410 --> 05:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
05:47:07.310 --> 05:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah so part of the um the HB 1612
 
05:47:10.548 --> 05:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
part of RSA 18966 is that we have a data
 
05:47:12.708 --> 05:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
governance plan and so most districts
 
05:47:15.410 --> 05:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
have developed those as policy
 
05:47:17.150 --> 05:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
um in the districts and they really
 
05:47:19.850 --> 05:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
outline what we do
 
05:47:21.890 --> 05:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
um with all kinds of cyber security and
 
05:47:24.708 --> 05:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
data governance but including vendor
 
05:47:24.718 --> 05:47:26.150 align:start position:0%
data governance but including vendor
products

05:47:26.150 --> 05:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
products
 
05:47:28.310 --> 05:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
um and how we approach those and each
 
05:47:31.070 --> 05:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
district does it their own way
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
um but most districts in New Hampshire
 
05:47:36.590 --> 05:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
have joined our Consortium or we call it
 
05:47:40.010 --> 05:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
an alliance I think we have um 80 82
 
05:47:42.530 --> 05:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
percent of districts in New Hampshire
 
05:47:44.570 --> 05:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
um yeah under that Alliance so that
 
05:47:46.850 --> 05:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
basically we're all doing the heavy
 
05:47:49.368 --> 05:47:49.378 align:start position:0%
lifting for each other if I sign a data
 
05:47:52.190 --> 05:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
privacy agreement with PowerSchool and
 
05:47:54.410 --> 05:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
another District wants power school they
 
05:47:56.750 --> 05:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
just sign a one-page addendum they don't
 
05:47:57.708 --> 05:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
have to go through that whole
 
05:47:59.810 --> 05:47:59.820 align:start position:0%
negotiation step
 
05:48:01.670 --> 05:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
um so so that's how we've been so
 
05:48:03.350 --> 05:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
successful in getting those data privacy
 
05:48:06.708 --> 05:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
grants policy talking about also deal
 
05:48:08.628 --> 05:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
with representative McDonald's issues of
 
05:48:08.638 --> 05:48:10.850 align:start position:0%
with representative McDonald's issues of
safety

05:48:10.850 --> 05:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
safety
 
05:48:10.860 --> 05:48:12.948 align:start position:0%
safety
um

05:48:12.948 --> 05:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:15.288 --> 05:48:15.298 align:start position:0%
yes and no like we don't use any social
 
05:48:17.330 --> 05:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
media officially in the district with
 
05:48:21.110 --> 05:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
students we have very few exceptions
 
05:48:21.120 --> 05:48:21.948 align:start position:0%
students we have very few exceptions
um

05:48:21.948 --> 05:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:24.410 --> 05:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
but um
 
05:48:25.970 --> 05:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
I I
 
05:48:29.270 --> 05:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
um the paragraph that she added here
 
05:48:29.280 --> 05:48:31.310 align:start position:0%
um the paragraph that she added here
um

05:48:31.310 --> 05:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:33.890 --> 05:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't I don't see any issues with
 
05:48:35.150 --> 05:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
that at all
 
05:48:37.430 --> 05:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
um I do think we have you know we have
 
05:48:38.990 --> 05:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
to be aware of student safety issues
 
05:48:42.770 --> 05:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:46.490 --> 05:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:47.890 --> 05:48:47.900 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
05:48:50.750 --> 05:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
privacy agreements absolutely and
 
05:48:53.270 --> 05:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
there's a great um Concord monitor
 
05:48:55.670 --> 05:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
monitor article last fall so I'll send
 
05:48:57.170 --> 05:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
that to you she did a really nice job
 
05:48:59.810 --> 05:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
explaining it it's a complicated process
 
05:49:02.690 --> 05:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
but she did a really nice job with it so
 
05:49:05.810 --> 05:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:08.628 --> 05:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
great representative Paul
 
05:49:11.030 --> 05:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
so Jeff the question for you so what is
 
05:49:12.650 --> 05:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
it you need
 
05:49:15.410 --> 05:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
to make things work let's say 60 days
 
05:49:17.150 --> 05:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
after passage let's say if there was
 
05:49:19.368 --> 05:49:19.378 align:start position:0%
something in the is it can is there
 
05:49:21.230 --> 05:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
something you can't do now that you want
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
to be able to do in September
 
05:49:26.628 --> 05:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
um well I I think the
 
05:49:26.638 --> 05:49:27.470 align:start position:0%
um well I I think the
um

05:49:27.470 --> 05:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:32.030 --> 05:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
the ability for a a teacher to lead a
 
05:49:34.548 --> 05:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
group of students through creating
 
05:49:34.558 --> 05:49:35.868 align:start position:0%
group of students through creating
um

05:49:35.868 --> 05:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:39.410 --> 05:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
profiles portfolios that can then be
 
05:49:42.590 --> 05:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
shared in real time and to be able to
 
05:49:45.410 --> 05:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
guide them through here's how you use
 
05:49:47.990 --> 05:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
these types of platforms I think that
 
05:49:51.170 --> 05:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
this would enable that to to happen and
 
05:49:52.730 --> 05:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
it can't happen right now
 
05:49:57.530 --> 05:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:59.690 --> 05:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
I get asked can I follow up I guess I'm
 
05:50:00.770 --> 05:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
just thinking
 
05:50:02.448 --> 05:50:02.458 align:start position:0%
to build on that like when I taught
 
05:50:04.430 --> 05:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
middle school and the kids made
 
05:50:07.490 --> 05:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
portfolios on websites they could share
 
05:50:09.410 --> 05:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
or not share I mean I mean we're talking
 
05:50:11.990 --> 05:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
about high school kids like I think we
 
05:50:14.750 --> 05:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
do need to teach see let these kids do
 
05:50:17.810 --> 05:50:17.820 align:start position:0%
this man I think we need to write it
 
05:50:19.970 --> 05:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
however we need to write it to make it
 
05:50:22.910 --> 05:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
work May I add that we've been working
 
05:50:25.548 --> 05:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire nhli New Hampshire
 
05:50:27.410 --> 05:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
learning initiative recently because
 
05:50:29.628 --> 05:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
they were working with Senator waters on
 
05:50:31.970 --> 05:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
this language the initial proposed
 
05:50:35.448 --> 05:50:35.458 align:start position:0%
language and I think we have found we've
 
05:50:36.948 --> 05:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
been working with our attorneys and we
 
05:50:39.650 --> 05:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
have found ways to use LinkedIn in
 
05:50:43.368 --> 05:50:43.378 align:start position:0%
schools without legislation so and it
 
05:50:45.230 --> 05:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
has to do with using their school email
 
05:50:47.090 --> 05:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
accounts so it's not a personal social
 
05:50:50.510 --> 05:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
media and getting parent permission so
 
05:50:52.730 --> 05:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
everything that is in law right now
 
05:50:55.788 --> 05:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
would allow us to do that without
 
05:50:58.190 --> 05:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
running a foul of the way
 
05:51:01.250 --> 05:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
um 189.70 reads right now so I I think
 
05:51:03.650 --> 05:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
it's it's a matter of you know we did a
 
05:51:05.270 --> 05:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
little digging in we talked to different
 
05:51:07.730 --> 05:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
attorneys we have a data privacy
 
05:51:09.410 --> 05:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
attorney that we work with in our
 
05:51:11.990 --> 05:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
Consortium and and Josh and I actually
 
05:51:14.690 --> 05:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
presented to their group uh was it just
 
05:51:16.970 --> 05:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
last week maybe about how how they could
 
05:51:21.890 --> 05:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:21.900 --> 05:51:26.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:51:26.030 --> 05:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:29.628 --> 05:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:32.690 --> 05:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
so do we then actually need this
 
05:51:35.208 --> 05:51:35.218 align:start position:0%
legislation if they can do it as long as
 
05:51:36.890 --> 05:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
they're using the school account and get
 
05:51:39.230 --> 05:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
parental permission and all of that
 
05:51:41.948 --> 05:51:41.958 align:start position:0%
stuff because this might open it up
 
05:51:45.110 --> 05:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
Beyond using the you know that and that
 
05:51:48.530 --> 05:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
seems like a good idea because it still
 
05:51:50.810 --> 05:51:50.820 align:start position:0%
provides the opportunity for the kids to
 
05:51:53.208 --> 05:51:53.218 align:start position:0%
learn and all of that without as much
 
05:51:53.218 --> 05:51:54.530 align:start position:0%
learn and all of that without as much
risk

05:51:54.530 --> 05:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
risk
 
05:51:57.708 --> 05:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
in my opinion no I think Jeff would
 
05:52:00.350 --> 05:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
still like it to be there I think that
 
05:52:02.570 --> 05:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
original introduced legislation at the
 
05:52:04.910 --> 05:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
Senate which was just the one sentence
 
05:52:08.150 --> 05:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
would help but um I don't think it's
 
05:52:08.160 --> 05:52:09.948 align:start position:0%
would help but um I don't think it's
necessary

05:52:09.948 --> 05:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
05:52:13.128 --> 05:52:13.138 align:start position:0%
um there was I don't think it's on this
 
05:52:14.448 --> 05:52:14.458 align:start position:0%
piece of paper wasn't there a whole
 
05:52:17.690 --> 05:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
paragraph amended about data privacy in
 
05:52:17.700 --> 05:52:18.530 align:start position:0%
paragraph amended about data privacy in
general

05:52:18.530 --> 05:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
general
 
05:52:20.150 --> 05:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
um during its
 
05:52:23.330 --> 05:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh time in the Senate
 
05:52:24.650 --> 05:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a whole nother
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph added I really think that that
 
05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
would add a lot of confusion because it
 
05:52:30.470 --> 05:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
should be under the do you want to see
 
05:52:35.448 --> 05:52:35.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:38.090 --> 05:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
so that was the original and this is the
 
05:52:40.548 --> 05:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
new so the original was this definition
 
05:52:43.010 --> 05:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
shall not apply to platforms used for
 
05:52:45.650 --> 05:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
demonstrating evidence in student career
 
05:52:45.660 --> 05:52:47.930 align:start position:0%
demonstrating evidence in student career
development

05:52:47.930 --> 05:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
development
 
05:52:50.390 --> 05:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
05:52:52.548 --> 05:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
I think that's just fine but anything
 
05:52:54.288 --> 05:52:54.298 align:start position:0%
else that really talks about data
 
05:52:58.190 --> 05:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
privacy I think is in the wrong RSA
 
05:53:03.010 --> 05:53:03.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:10.150 --> 05:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:13.430 --> 05:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah paragraph two is the thing that I
 
05:53:16.250 --> 05:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
think causes some confusion this is from
 
05:53:18.410 --> 05:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
the perspective of being in the
 
05:53:20.150 --> 05:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
technology director having to navigate
 
05:53:23.208 --> 05:53:23.218 align:start position:0%
these laws and I think that this
 
05:53:25.730 --> 05:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
paragraph would certainly be worth
 
05:53:27.948 --> 05:53:27.958 align:start position:0%
looking at as part of the data privacy
 
05:53:32.628 --> 05:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
189 66 next year but in the social media
 
05:53:37.490 --> 05:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:40.510 --> 05:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:43.190 --> 05:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
ripsing Paul
 
05:53:45.470 --> 05:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
um so what is the procedure let's say if
 
05:53:48.110 --> 05:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
we wanted to not do the amendment which
 
05:53:50.448 --> 05:53:50.458 align:start position:0%
has been brought to us but go back to
 
05:53:51.830 --> 05:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
the original
 
05:53:53.990 --> 05:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
one with that one sentence what is a
 
05:53:55.910 --> 05:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
process there how does that go about can
 
05:53:57.288 --> 05:53:57.298 align:start position:0%
you go about that or did you make
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
another amendment what do you have to do
 
05:54:00.530 --> 05:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
right we could do another amendment that
 
05:54:02.090 --> 05:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
goes back to the original
 
05:54:04.730 --> 05:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
or whatever you can do whatever okay
 
05:54:08.410 --> 05:54:08.420 align:start position:0%
whatever we want the Senate right yeah
 
05:54:10.610 --> 05:54:10.620 align:start position:0%
committee conference yes that's what I
 
05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:17.990 --> 05:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
two questions one to each
 
05:54:20.750 --> 05:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
um the amendment that Senator Waters
 
05:54:25.208 --> 05:54:25.218 align:start position:0%
brought in for paragraph two
 
05:54:29.390 --> 05:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
do you like the wording of that and if
 
05:54:32.810 --> 05:54:32.820 align:start position:0%
we just could we put that but in the
 
05:54:36.288 --> 05:54:36.298 align:start position:0%
proper part of law rather than social
 
05:54:38.390 --> 05:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
media where it doesn't belong I mean
 
05:54:40.250 --> 05:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
because if we're amending
 
05:54:42.948 --> 05:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
we could just amend where it goes
 
05:54:45.230 --> 05:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
if you think it's good the way it is
 
05:54:47.750 --> 05:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise we'll take the time and do it
 
05:54:49.310 --> 05:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
next year
 
05:54:49.320 --> 05:54:51.048 align:start position:0%
next year
um

05:54:51.048 --> 05:54:51.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:53.208 --> 05:54:53.218 align:start position:0%
we don't feel that it's necessary
 
05:54:56.270 --> 05:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
because we can already do parental
 
05:55:00.230 --> 05:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
opt-in uh permission under FERPA so we
 
05:55:02.448 --> 05:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
already have that ability I think this
 
05:55:04.730 --> 05:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
is aimed at the districts where maybe
 
05:55:06.530 --> 05:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
they're taking a harder line than some
 
05:55:08.090 --> 05:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
of us do
 
05:55:10.070 --> 05:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
05:55:13.128 --> 05:55:13.138 align:start position:0%
I um I do think that if we were going to
 
05:55:15.048 --> 05:55:15.058 align:start position:0%
consider language like this we would
 
05:55:17.990 --> 05:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
want it in 66 instead of 70.
 
05:55:20.868 --> 05:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
so would that be appropriate I mean do
 
05:55:22.368 --> 05:55:22.378 align:start position:0%
you have a problem with the way it's
 
05:55:25.548 --> 05:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
worded if we just put it in 66 rather
 
05:55:25.558 --> 05:55:27.110 align:start position:0%
worded if we just put it in 66 rather
than

05:55:27.110 --> 05:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:55:29.868 --> 05:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
the place it is no Josh he's more legal
 
05:55:32.750 --> 05:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
than I am because yes it was
 
05:55:36.110 --> 05:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
specifically aimed at districts who said
 
05:55:39.368 --> 05:55:39.378 align:start position:0%
oh according to the rules we can't do it
 
05:55:42.110 --> 05:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
and it's to make it clear that yeah you
 
05:55:45.110 --> 05:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
can this is the process what what I
 
05:55:47.030 --> 05:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
would like to do is because we just got
 
05:55:48.470 --> 05:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
brought into this maybe about a month
 
05:55:50.448 --> 05:55:50.458 align:start position:0%
ago Josh and I
 
05:55:52.010 --> 05:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
um what I would like to do is spend
 
05:55:54.170 --> 05:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
maybe six months really working on some
 
05:55:55.970 --> 05:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
of these products with the Department of
 
05:55:59.510 --> 05:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
Ed with the CTE directors let's see
 
05:56:01.368 --> 05:56:01.378 align:start position:0%
where the barriers are and try to work
 
05:56:03.410 --> 05:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
through the issues and then kind of go
 
05:56:05.868 --> 05:56:05.878 align:start position:0%
fresh into next year and see what do we
 
05:56:07.310 --> 05:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
need in the law because it does feel
 
05:56:09.170 --> 05:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
like we're over legislating a little bit
 
05:56:11.570 --> 05:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah when I read the law I
 
05:56:15.470 --> 05:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
said this isn't necessary so and nhli is
 
05:56:18.890 --> 05:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
has offered up some funds for us to help
 
05:56:20.750 --> 05:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
them develop some guidance and some
 
05:56:22.970 --> 05:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
guidelines we've started speaking to the
 
05:56:25.490 --> 05:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
superintendents Association because in
 
05:56:27.048 --> 05:56:27.058 align:start position:0%
my mind the only people that can mediate
 
05:56:29.330 --> 05:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
between CTE directors and Technology
 
05:56:32.330 --> 05:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
directors our superintendents so we've
 
05:56:34.190 --> 05:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
started to really think about what can
 
05:56:37.190 --> 05:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
we do more in terms of communication and
 
05:56:39.410 --> 05:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
just really providing materials and sort
 
05:56:41.810 --> 05:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
of flow charts and best practices that
 
05:56:43.490 --> 05:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
might help alleviate some of these
 
05:56:46.548 --> 05:56:46.558 align:start position:0%
situations I I think I'd rather more
 
05:56:48.470 --> 05:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
than happy to work on legislation but I
 
05:56:50.810 --> 05:56:50.820 align:start position:0%
think I'd rather try the Kinder gentler
 
05:56:53.150 --> 05:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
approach okay thank you one option would
 
05:56:57.890 --> 05:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
be to retain 213 and work on it into the
 
05:56:57.900 --> 05:56:59.810 align:start position:0%
be to retain 213 and work on it into the
fall

05:56:59.810 --> 05:56:59.820 align:start position:0%
fall
 
05:56:59.820 --> 05:57:00.530 align:start position:0%
fall
um

05:57:00.530 --> 05:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:02.990 --> 05:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
give us some more time and your
 
05:57:05.570 --> 05:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
conversations that you're you're having
 
05:57:08.090 --> 05:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
with superintendents Etc have some more
 
05:57:10.548 --> 05:57:10.558 align:start position:0%
time to come up with something a little
 
05:57:12.190 --> 05:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
bit broader and
 
05:57:14.990 --> 05:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
satisfies everyone's
 
05:57:18.190 --> 05:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
concerns that that would be
 
05:57:21.708 --> 05:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
an option and they worked really hard on
 
05:57:24.048 --> 05:57:24.058 align:start position:0%
that introduced you know the bill as it
 
05:57:26.868 --> 05:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
was introduced that one sentence I would
 
05:57:28.910 --> 05:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
hate to say anything here that would
 
05:57:32.208 --> 05:57:32.218 align:start position:0%
negate all of that hard work and that we
 
05:57:33.650 --> 05:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
have no problem with that sentence
 
05:57:35.570 --> 05:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
really I mean if if that's something you
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to move forward
 
05:57:40.548 --> 05:57:40.558 align:start position:0%
um a lot of Educators have worked very
 
05:57:43.850 --> 05:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
hard on that one particular sentence so
 
05:57:51.430 --> 05:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:55.190 --> 05:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
I have a follow-up meeting after some
 
05:57:58.250 --> 05:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
consideration we have have some time and
 
05:58:00.230 --> 05:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
we have a number of other meetings
 
05:58:03.170 --> 05:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
scheduled in the upcoming weeks that we
 
05:58:05.990 --> 05:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
could piggy back a follow-up meeting on
 
05:58:06.000 --> 05:58:07.490 align:start position:0%
could piggy back a follow-up meeting on
to

05:58:07.490 --> 05:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:58:07.500 --> 05:58:08.090 align:start position:0%
to
um

05:58:08.090 --> 05:58:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:10.430 --> 05:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
and take a look at that if
 
05:58:13.850 --> 05:58:13.860 align:start position:0%
so would it be better to
 
05:58:16.070 --> 05:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
move forward with this bill right here
 
05:58:18.110 --> 05:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
with the one sentence
 
05:58:22.070 --> 05:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
and then in November put forth a new
 
05:58:22.080 --> 05:58:22.970 align:start position:0%
and then in November put forth a new
bill

05:58:22.970 --> 05:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:58:27.230 --> 05:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:29.150 --> 05:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
I'm checking before I say something that
 
05:58:32.510 --> 05:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
represents both of us all of us a new
 
05:58:33.830 --> 05:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
bill would be
 
05:58:37.310 --> 05:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
introduced in January and not signed
 
05:58:40.128 --> 05:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
into law until next
 
05:58:40.138 --> 05:58:42.350 align:start position:0%
into law until next
summer

05:58:42.350 --> 05:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
summer
 
05:58:44.810 --> 05:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
I think I'd prefer the one sentence in
 
05:58:48.410 --> 05:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
in 213 and then and then um
 
05:58:50.930 --> 05:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
and then kind of regrouping and seeing
 
05:58:52.430 --> 05:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
what we need to do with data privacy
 
05:58:55.628 --> 05:58:55.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:58.190 --> 05:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
I'm all for that I think I misunderstood
 
05:59:00.110 --> 05:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
what was just said when we went to
 
05:59:01.970 --> 05:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
January that was a new bill is that what
 
05:59:04.548 --> 05:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
you said yes a new bill would be
 
05:59:06.350 --> 05:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
introduced in January if you move
 
05:59:09.368 --> 05:59:09.378 align:start position:0%
forward with this one right right
 
05:59:11.810 --> 05:59:11.820 align:start position:0%
the one sentence it would still be
 
05:59:14.810 --> 05:59:14.820 align:start position:0%
January no that would be now I mean it
 
05:59:17.330 --> 05:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
would be in the fall yeah if you move
 
05:59:19.310 --> 05:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
forward with one sentence now it'd
 
05:59:20.868 --> 05:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
probably be signed in oh yes right yes
 
05:59:23.230 --> 05:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
right right okay that's what I mean yeah
 
05:59:26.270 --> 05:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
it'll take another year exactly yeah I'm
 
05:59:29.030 --> 05:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
all for now it's and it's my hope that
 
05:59:30.708 --> 05:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
when we come back in six months we'll
 
05:59:32.570 --> 05:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
have communicated all the issues out and
 
05:59:34.850 --> 05:59:34.860 align:start position:0%
we just don't need to
 
05:59:39.670 --> 05:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:43.250 --> 05:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
if if we do an amendment with the one
 
05:59:45.948 --> 05:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
sentence back to the original
 
05:59:47.690 --> 05:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
um then
 
05:59:50.510 --> 05:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
um if we pass it it will then require a
 
06:00:05.868 --> 06:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:05.878 --> 06:00:07.548 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:00:07.548 --> 06:00:07.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:09.850 --> 06:00:09.860 align:start position:0%
why don't we
 
06:00:12.830 --> 06:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
take a little bit of time think about it
 
06:00:15.770 --> 06:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
and have another brief meeting
 
06:00:18.590 --> 06:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
um in in the near future and decide if
 
06:00:20.810 --> 06:00:20.820 align:start position:0%
we want to go forward with the one
 
06:00:24.650 --> 06:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:26.930 --> 06:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
06:00:26.940 --> 06:00:28.368 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you

great
 
06:00:43.190 --> 06:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:48.350 --> 06:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:48.360 --> 06:03:18.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:03:18.410 --> 06:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:18.420 --> 06:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
