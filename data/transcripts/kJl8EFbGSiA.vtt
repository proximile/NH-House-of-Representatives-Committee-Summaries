good morning everyone and welcome to the
 
00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
September 26 2023 meeting of the science
 
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
technology and energy Commission
 
00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 align:start position:0%
we have a day chock full of interesting
 
00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 align:start position:0%
and exciting activity planned for today
 
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
we've got a couple of presentations this
 
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.730 align:start position:0%
we've got a couple of presentations this
morning

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
which we'll get to in just a minute
 
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
and then at one o'clock this afternoon
 
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
after a lunch break we will be back for
 
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
a full committee work session on the 12
 
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
retained bills which we held on to this
 
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 align:start position:0%
past May April and May
 
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
and during that work session what we're
 
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
going to do is go through the list of
 
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
bills and decide
 
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
what bills will need a subcommittee then
 
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
we will appoint a subcommittee
 
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
I will appoint a chair for the
 
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and we'll go over the
 
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
duties of the subcommittee as well
 
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
so that will be our activity for after
 
00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 align:start position:0%
the lunch break starting at one o'clock
 
00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
but to begin our presentations this
 
00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
morning I would like to call on
 
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative Tom Corman to introduce
 
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman our first speaker
 
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
is Professor soroshe vasogi from the
 
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College Department of computer
 
00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 align:start position:0%
science and I am pleased to say that he
 
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
is a former colleague of mine now that
 
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
can be taken in two ways and I mean it
 
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
the good way
 
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
so um uh sirosh is quite an expert on AI
 
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
he's presented in various places and
 
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.850 align:start position:0%
he's presented in various places and
um

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
yes you'll you'll need to turn your mic
 
00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 align:start position:0%
on Professor thank you
 
00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.149 align:start position:0%
on Professor thank you
foreign

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 align:start position:0%
let's see if this thing shows up
 
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.410 align:start position:0%
let's see if this thing shows up
[Music]

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.630 align:start position:0%
great thank you
um

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you for having me here and if
 
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
you cannot hear me clearly please let me
 
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
know and I'll try to speak louder I'll
 
00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
move the microphone a little closer I
 
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
thought I will introduce
 
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh basically the current advances in AI
 
00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 align:start position:0%
today and talk about some of the uh I
 
00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
guess uh major uh coverage of AI and
 
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about which which of
 
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
the coverage is true which is false
 
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
which is you know fear-mongering which
 
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
is uh actually something to be concerned
 
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
about so I titled the talk AI what it is
 
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
and what is not
 
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
and you know I don't need to motivate
 
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
this uh uh for the audience here but uh
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
basically as you all know AI has been
 
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
all over the news recently some of the
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
coverage positive some of it negative so
 
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
here you can see some example of
 
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
coverage of AI that is mainly positive
 
00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 align:start position:0%
right so basically
 
00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:58.969 align:start position:0%
right so basically
um

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
the uh how generative AI can lead to a
 
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
boom in hiring and so on and so forth
 
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
just a couple of examples from just this
 
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.810 align:start position:0%
just a couple of examples from just this
summer

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
summer
 
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
but there's actually a lot more negative
 
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
coverage of AI and uh you know if you
 
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
open up any news Outlet in in in recent
 
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
weeks you'll see that there's always
 
00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
some kind of a doom and gloom coverage
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
of AI including some as uh you know
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
I guess sensationalists as this article
 
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
like can is AI really the Doom of
 
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
humanity so uh
 
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
I did a bit of a study where I looked at
 
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
the coverage of AI and I found that
 
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
there is a two to one basically biased
 
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
against AI so twice as many articles are
 
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
talking about what AI uh where AI could
 
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
go wrong about the third talk about
 
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
where AI can actually help you manage so
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of fear around Ai and so
 
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
what I want to discuss today is whether
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 align:start position:0%
and you probably uh all notice but there
 
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
was a recent meeting at Washington uh
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
discussing uh regulating AI uh including
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of the current tech industry
 
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
leaders like the uh CEO of openai Google
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
and a few other uh big companies so this
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
is a really current uh topic and
 
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
something that uh I think is very
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
important for legislators to uh be at
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
least somewhat aware of
 
00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:49.670 align:start position:0%
least somewhat aware of
so

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of coverage of AI
 
00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:56.699 align:start position:0%
most of it uh you know fearful some of
 
00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
it hopeful but what is AI
 
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
most people actually will not be able to
 
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
answer that question uh that's because
 
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:10.259 align:start position:0%
basically terminologies and Concepts and
 
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
topics that you see being covered in the
 
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.909 align:start position:0%
topics that you see being covered in the
news

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
news
 
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
that are talking about similar things
 
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
but uh there's really no uh
 
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
understanding of uh you know what is
 
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
what so here I have uh shown you some
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
examples of the topics that you might
 
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
have read about in in recent news
 
00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
coverage of AI
 
00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
um just uh uh out of curiosity uh
 
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
everyone has heard at least half of this
 
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:38.180 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh
 
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
everyone here I'm assuming has at least
 
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
seen half of these topics being
 
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
discussed is that correct if if any of
 
00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
if anyone hasn't seen at least half of
 
00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
these uh Topics in richer news articles
 
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand I want to see uh
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
right so this is basically something
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
that is already used right so artificial
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
intelligence machine learning deep
 
00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:00.419 align:start position:0%
neural networks deep learning chat GPT
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
deep fake self-driving cars all related
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
to AI but actually very different
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
concepts here I've uh ordered the
 
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
concepts into two categories the top
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
category and the bottom category
 
00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:15.419 align:start position:0%
um and um you know I I hope you don't
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
mind me asking some questions while I
 
00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:19.259 align:start position:0%
you know as I go forward with my talk
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
but can anyone tell me uh what they
 
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
think are is the top category and what
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
is the bottom category so you have ai
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
machine learning and deep learning at
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
the top and at the bottom you have Dolly
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
chat GPT deep fakes Alexander
 
00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:35.459 align:start position:0%
self-driving cars any uh
 
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
um am I allowed to ask questions or
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
so what is the uh so there are two
 
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
categories the one on the top and the
 
00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:44.459 align:start position:0%
one at the bottom what do you think uh
 
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
these two categories are
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
you can see them so is AI Concepts the
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
bottom row is AI implementations so uh
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
very good yeah so the taboro is
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
basically Technologies let's put it that
 
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
way and the bottom row is the
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
applications of these Technologies right
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
so uh AI machine learning and deep
 
00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
learning into all Technologies chat GPT
 
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
Dolly and deep fake Alexa self-driving
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
cars with all applications the reason
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
why it's important to separate
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
technology from applications is because
 
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.410 align:start position:0%
technology from applications is because
uh

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
so um yeah just to uh
 
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
show this as uh I just mentioned top Pro
 
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
Technologies bottom row applications uh
 
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
the reason why it's important to
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
separate Technologies from applications
 
00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
is because um
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
you know Technologies
 
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
more or less you can think of them as
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
being neutral you can use them for good
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
you can use them for bad uh you know a
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
car can be uh you know used for good for
 
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
transportation you can also use a car to
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
run people over so Technologies
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
themselves don't really have uh any kind
 
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
of bias towards being you know good or
 
00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
bad but applications of Technologies do
 
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
so uh the um you know examples that I've
 
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
given here for instance you can imagine
 
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
some of them being a lot more
 
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
controversial than others so for
 
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
instance Alexa and Siri probably less
 
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
controversial deep fakes very
 
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
controversial uh uh so this division
 
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
between Technologies and applications is
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
very very important to keep in mind when
 
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
discussing AI a good analogy that I use
 
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.090 align:start position:0%
discussing AI a good analogy that I use
is

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
um you know the technology of winged
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
flight so uh when uh you know the
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
principal of lift was discovered you
 
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
know how you can basically design a wing
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
so that you get higher pressure at the
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
bottom of the wing than than top so that
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know you get lift that's the
 
00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:49.019 align:start position:0%
technology right it's it's wind flight
 
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
applications could be you know manifold
 
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
could be civilian applications military
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
applications some for good some for bad
 
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
but the technology itself it's it's hard
 
00:10:59.449 --> 00:10:59.459 align:start position:0%
to say that it's you know good or bad
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
it's the applications that really need
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important kind of the
 
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019 align:start position:0%
first takeaway should be that when
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
discussing AI I think it's important to
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
be discussing applications of AIS AI
 
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
more than the technology of AI so uh
 
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
even though obviously uh the the
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
technology is what leads to these
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
applications is the applications that
 
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
could potentially be you know anti or
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
pro-social depending on how they're used
 
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
okay so let's uh
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know dig a little further in and
 
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
let's talk about these uh three
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
Technologies AI machine learning and
 
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
deep neural networks or deep learning
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so you have three uh uh circles here
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
three sets of Technologies uh and there
 
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
are different ways they could be related
 
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
to each other right so let's uh think
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
about different Venn diagrams you could
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
use to uh
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
um to look at the relationship between
 
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
these Technologies
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
so at the top you have them being
 
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
completely you know in the separate
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
independent Technologies bottom left you
 
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:10.019 align:start position:0%
see them overlapping so meaning that
 
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
they're the same thing bottom right you
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
know there's some overlap between them
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
um you know the audience uh who thinks
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
that the top left uh you know diagram is
 
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
the correct diagram where these three
 
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
things are completely independent
 
00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
we think the bottom left is correct
 
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
where they're all the same thing just
 
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
different terminologies and who thinks
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
the bottom right is correct
 
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
okay so it's a trick question none of
 
00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:38.459 align:start position:0%
these are correct uh but thank you for
 
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
participating uh the correct
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
representation is actually this so AI is
 
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
a term that pretty much encompasses all
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
uh basically machines May begin human
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
behavior that's General uh definition of
 
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
AI machine learning is a subset of AI
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
where um uh you know the uh the mimika
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
human behavior is done by exposing the
 
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
the system the machine to a lot of data
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
you can think of it as experience and
 
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
the Machine the automatically learns to
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
mimic human behavior from the data that
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's exposed to
 
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
you can imagine there are ways to uh
 
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
create a machine that mimics human
 
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
behavior that doesn't use data so for
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
instance if someone hard codes a set of
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
behaviors or a machine to follow then
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
that machine it's still called an AI
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
system but it's not learning from data
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
right that is the difference we're
 
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
talking about a good example of uh that
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
would be for example the autopilot
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
system on a plane the autopilot system
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
on a plane is not it's not a system
 
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
that's learned that's learning from data
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's been hard-coded to
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
fly an airplane basically if he was
 
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
learning from data you can imagine that
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
would be quite problematic as it could
 
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
lead to uh you know errors and whatnot
 
00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
so that's so that's AI as a whole
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
systems that maybe human behavior
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
machine learning subset of AI that
 
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
learns from data and then deep neural
 
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
networks or deep learning
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh if you've heard of it it's just a
 
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
subset of machine learning algorithms uh
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
the uh I guess the defining
 
00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
characteristics of deep neural networks
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
is that they rely on massive amount of
 
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
data that's one the area is that they
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
remove humans from the loop so I'll go
 
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
into that a little bit but uh you can
 
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.550 align:start position:0%
into that a little bit but uh you can
imagine

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
if you're using data to create these AI
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
systems you could either have humans
 
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
provide the data to these systems or you
 
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
could have the systems go and find their
 
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
own data basically and in some ways
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
that's what deep neural networks do so
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
there is a much less Reliance on humans
 
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
to provide the data for these models
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
so why do I have this division because
 
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.550 align:start position:0%
so why do I have this division because
every

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
application that I showed you so uh chat
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
GPT Dolly deep fakes all of those are
 
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.870 align:start position:0%
GPT Dolly deep fakes all of those are
actually

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:15:11.769 --> 00:15:11.779 align:start position:0%
fall under the Deep neural networks set
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
so you know it's AI has been around for
 
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
for decades uh it's just the recent
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
advances in deep neural networks which
 
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:23.220 align:start position:0%
is a specific technology uh that will
 
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
again that allows AI models to learn
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
from data for massive amount of data
 
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
without much human
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
um uh uh you know uh oversight these are
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
the models that have allowed or these
 
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
are this is the technology that has
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
allowed you know these huge advances
 
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
that we've seen in recent years like for
 
00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:47.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
before I go further
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
um like anyone
 
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
have a guess why deep neural networks uh
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
are potentially problematic so you know
 
00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
we all know that there are potential
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
there are potential issues with you know
 
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
chat GPT deep fakes uh Dolly all of
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
these systems and as I said they all
 
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
fall under the Deep neural network
 
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
category any any reason why uh relying
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
on massive amount of data and removing
 
00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
humans from the loop could be
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
problematic yeah yeah go ahead garbage
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
garbage in garbage out ah there you go
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
if the bait if the if the data that the
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
network is using is um flawed or biased
 
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
you're going to get bad actions
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
excellent yes so that's a big one
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
because if the data is bad then the
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
output is going to be bad yes
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
I would just follow with the removing
 
00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:41.579 align:start position:0%
the humans from the loop uh means that
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
we could have outcomes that are not
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
consistent with what we're hoping to
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
achieve excellent yes anyone else yes
 
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
at a practical application I'm seeing uh
 
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
one that was not on your original chart
 
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
was uh facial recognition and the
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
mistakes that are often made in that
 
00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.509 align:start position:0%
mistakes that are often made in that
well

00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
two mistakes is too often when they
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
convert human life like that
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
yes uh very good so yes one more
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
uh I I would say whoever controls the
 
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:15.419 align:start position:0%
data has has an awful lot of power
 
00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459 align:start position:0%
that's also a great Point data being the
 
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
beginning of everything so uh if you
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
think of the pipeline of these models it
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
all starts from the data so if anyone
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
someone controls the data then they can
 
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
basically control the output of these
 
00:17:30.169 --> 00:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
models so yes I think uh these are all
 
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
great points and they actually get to
 
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
exactly uh what I'm going to get into
 
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
next uh yeah so this is just saying that
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
these technologies that we've all seen
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
in recent years they fall under this
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
deep neural network category
 
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.289 --> 00:17:48.299 align:start position:0%
you know this is just a visualization of
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
uh you know very simple visualization of
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh kind of the difference between so
 
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
again here neural networks are a subset
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
of machine learning and uh a big
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
difference between just traditional
 
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
machine learning and deep learning is as
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
you can see the removal of human in the
 
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
loop right so uh traditionally this is a
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
very you know simple example let's say
 
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
you have a model that's detecting
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
whether an image has a tree on it in it
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
or not so is it a tree or not a tree
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
very simple model uh traditionally there
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
were you know there was a lot of input
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
so these are examples of images of trees
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
there were people like humans in the
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
loop labeling these examples and maybe
 
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
removing bad examples then you would
 
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
train a model and then you get an output
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
with deep learning that human there's no
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
longer this human in the loop so this is
 
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
a big uh I think uh one of the big
 
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
advances which allows for of course
 
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
scaling systems up by removing humans in
 
00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
the loop you can do things much faster
 
00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:48.539 align:start position:0%
but also so it removes any kind of
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
oversight that these models usually um
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
or the machine learning models typically
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
had in the past
 
00:18:59.450 --> 00:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
and this is a very very unrealistic
 
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
visualization of a neural network but in
 
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.630 align:start position:0%
visualization of a neural network but in
case

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
you know but but it it does uh do a good
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh I guess uh job of uh at least
 
00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
demonstrating the uh the structure of
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
neural networks uh it's it's a uh very
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh again it's a toy example
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
but uh the general idea is that they're
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
called neural networks because the basic
 
00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
uh uh processing units in these networks
 
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
are these uh you know nodes we call
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
neurons that are simple mathematical uh
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
functions so at the end of the day these
 
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh uh these models are not magic they
 
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
are basically a uh you know Cascade or
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
collection of mathematical functions
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
that take data as input they transform
 
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
it the data you know through different
 
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
layers as you can see here and then they
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
output some result
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day it's just math but
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
what the um
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
um uh what is kind of unique about
 
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
neural networks compared to uh other AI
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
or machine Learning Systems is that uh
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
the input that goes into these systems
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
can just be raw data without any kind of
 
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
processing done by uh humans again as as
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
we saw here we see here so just input
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
from the raw input from The Real World
 
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
goes directly into these models both for
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
training and uh and and uh you know and
 
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.299 align:start position:0%
deployment so it removes the human
 
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
completely from the loop okay
 
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.830 align:start position:0%
completely from the loop okay
so

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
um let's talk about uh one again this is
 
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
just a representation of a neural
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
network uh let's let's focus on one of
 
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
the Technologies
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
um that you know has been making the
 
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
news recently which is chat gbt uh it's
 
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.669 align:start position:0%
news recently which is chat gbt uh it's
a

00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
the technology itself actually is called
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh large language models or large
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
pre-trained language models chat gbt is
 
00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
an application of such a technology
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
um so for instance Google and other uh
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
so chat Tubidy is an open AI tool Google
 
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
has its own version Bart and meta is
 
00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
going to have its own version soon so
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
these are just different applications of
 
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
the same technology large language
 
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
models and as you've all if you've
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
played with child GPT you know that they
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
can perform many tasks on private humans
 
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
and sometimes actually outperforming
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
humans so it's a great advance in
 
00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:23.570 align:start position:0%
humans so it's a great advance in
technology

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:28.100 align:start position:0%
well and by the way uh I I put this
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
slide in my talk because even though
 
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
it's only recently that people have been
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
aware of this technology large language
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
models because of chat GPT it's actually
 
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
been out for a couple of years now so uh
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
gpt3 which is the uh the tech the court
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
ogpt which is the core Tech behind chat
 
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.590 align:start position:0%
ogpt which is the core Tech behind chat
GPT

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
GPT
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
has been out for years now so this
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
article was written in 2020 in the
 
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.930 align:start position:0%
article was written in 2020 in the
guardian

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
guardian
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
it was completely generated by one of
 
00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
these large language models GPT so again
 
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh it's only recently that
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
because I charge GPD it has uh you know
 
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
come to the Public's attention but the
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
technology itself has been out for for a
 
00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
couple of years now if you're interested
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
you can read this article again
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
completely written by uh uh by gbt3
 
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
so it's not it's not new the technology
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
itself is not new it's a couple of years
 
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
old the applications like child GPD
 
00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
that's new
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
okay and if you haven't used chat gbt I
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
really recommend you to play around with
 
00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:33.419 align:start position:0%
it it's free to use and uh here's an
 
00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
example of what you can do with child
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
GPT so uh you know if you just ask it
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
write an inspiration speech about the
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
status of chat gbt you can see that you
 
00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:45.419 align:start position:0%
can generate pretty coherent uh you know
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
text based on the prompt
 
00:22:51.409 --> 00:22:51.419 align:start position:0%
in some ways it's uh you know not really
 
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
distinguishable from a human writing
 
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.190 align:start position:0%
distinguishable from a human writing
okay

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
so these issues with the large language
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
models you know are exactly as uh you
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
know was discussed garbage and garbage
 
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
out so very nice uh that was the first
 
00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh comment because they rely on massive
 
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
amount of data and there is no uh basic
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
or very little human oversight if the
 
00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
data is biased if it's toxic if it's
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
stereotypical anything is going to be
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
represented in the output of the model
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
the model cannot uh uh really separate
 
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
good data from Bad data automatically so
 
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
that's one of the biggest issues humans
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
have been taken out of the loop there's
 
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
Reliance on massive amount of data and
 
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
this data you know I mean there's no
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
oversight basically it's just the
 
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:39.059 align:start position:0%
publicly available data we didn't have
 
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
this problem with other AI models in the
 
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
past because as uh as I showed here
 
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
anything in the green circle that was
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
not part of machine learning that
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't rely on data right so there's no
 
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
there's no issue of uh oops garbage in
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
garbage out
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
and then even with machine learning
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
models that do learn from data uh the
 
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059 align:start position:0%
the kind of classical machine learning
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
models have this human in the loop that
 
00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:06.260 align:start position:0%
allows for
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
providing oversight to these models it
 
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
is deep neural network specifically that
 
00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
rely on a lot of data without human
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
oversight that have this issue I just
 
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
emphasize that point so garbage and
 
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
garbage out a big issue and the uh
 
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
obviously if the data that these models
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
were trained on were good then there
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
would be no problem but as you may know
 
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
the data is actually scraped from the
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
web so it's a publicly available data on
 
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
the internet and you know anyone who's
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
been on the internet knows that you know
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
there's some good stuff but there's also
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of toxic speech hate speech you
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
know misinformation there's just all
 
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
sorts of things good things and bad
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
things but again these models are
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
trained on everything they don't really
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
uh separate what is good from what is
 
00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:54.649 align:start position:0%
uh separate what is good from what is
bad

00:24:54.649 --> 00:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
bad
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh and then the second issue that these
 
00:24:59.930 --> 00:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
models have is that they're black boxes
 
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
so even the people who work on these
 
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
models including my lab even though we
 
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
understand the the kind of the uh the
 
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
math Behind These models we cannot
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
really explain why these models make the
 
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
decisions that they do you know uh
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
similar to you can think of it as a
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
human brain I mean a human brain you can
 
00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
uh or a human with a brain you can ask
 
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
it things and you will get responses
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
back and you might have behavioral
 
00:25:27.049 --> 00:25:27.059 align:start position:0%
scientists trying to understand how
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
humans make decisions but it's a it's
 
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
it's a big unknown it's really not known
 
00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
because brands are these huge
 
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
complicated systems it's not really
 
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
known how exactly the decision-making
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
process works in the human brain
 
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
similarly these neural networks are huge
 
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
models that are impossible to really
 
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
understand so garbage and garbage out
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
black box and again it's an issue with
 
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
deep neural networks specifically
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
because of their size so garbage and
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
garbage out you should be different
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
networks but because of the Reliance on
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
data and removal of human oversight
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
black box issue with deep neural
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
networks because of their size and
 
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.450 align:start position:0%
networks because of their size and
finally

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:04.460 align:start position:0%
finally
 
00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
you may have heard this term but they
 
00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:09.299 align:start position:0%
have a tendency to hallucinate anyone
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
heard about hallucinations for these
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
models the
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
so basically uh because they're so large
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
sometimes not all the time they can
 
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
combine what they've seen
 
00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
in the data in imaginative ways to
 
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
output something that sounds plausible
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
but it's not
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
so for instance
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know uh Dolly uh which is if you're
 
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:42.380 align:start position:0%
not familiar with Dolly it's an image
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
creation tool so you're basically write
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
in a little prompt and it will create
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
automatically generate an image that
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
matches the prompt that you've written
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
so if you ask it to uh create an image
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
of a cat
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
sometimes it might and I've seen this
 
00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
myself it might create an image of a cat
 
00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
with like three heads right I mean
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's just a very uh clear uh example
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
of hallucination but uh you know it's
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
not limited to image only also a text uh
 
00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
systems like chat GPT uh are prone to
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
hallucination which means that they make
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
up information that sounds correct
 
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
and the models that's the the uh the
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
difficult here is that the model itself
 
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
thinks the information is correct so the
 
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
model is not trying to deceive the user
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
the model just thinks this is correct
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
but it's hallucinating so it's not
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
correct and again this is a problem that
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
is very specific to this deep normal
 
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
networks so I've identified three of
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
these issues but there were a few others
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
that were mentioned which are also very
 
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.210 align:start position:0%
that were mentioned which are also very
important

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
um and uh yeah so let's take a little uh
 
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
dig a little bit deeper into these three
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure a little bit of uh math
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
here I I hope uh that's okay but I just
 
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
wanna uh really
 
00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:56.570 align:start position:0%
wanna uh really
um

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh explain when I say these models are
 
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
large what I mean by large because it is
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
the size of these models that make them
 
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
black boxes so as I said um you know
 
00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
machine learning models are not magic
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
they're basically just mathematical
 
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
functions if as you can think of a line
 
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
like a simple linear regression line of
 
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
best feed as a very simple model it is a
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
mathematical model that can make
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
predictions right so you uh have a line
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
of best you learn a line of best fit now
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
you have new data coming in new X You
 
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
can predict y right that's a very simple
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
machine learning model it's trained on
 
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.390 align:start position:0%
machine learning model it's trained on
data

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
right that use the data to learn the
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
line of best speed and you can make
 
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
future predictions it's a very simple
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
model it's a machine learning model
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
um a simple line like this uh how many
 
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
parameters do you think this line has
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
what is it like an equation for for a
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
line anyone remember from high school uh
 
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
not Tom anyone yes
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
oh very good yes it does have two
 
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
so yeah so it has two parameters The
 
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
Intercept exactly the where the line is
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
intercepting the y-axis and the slope of
 
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
the line right if you remember from high
 
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
school math y equals MX plus b and being
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
the slow hope B being The Intercept
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter the math uh for it but
 
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
the idea is that it has two parameters
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
it's specifying the intercept and the
 
00:29:27.889 --> 00:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
slope of the line right so this is the
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
equation for it m and b here are the two
 
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.250 align:start position:0%
equation for it m and b here are the two
parameters

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
parameters
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
so these two parameters explain this
 
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.850 align:start position:0%
so these two parameters explain this
model

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
model
 
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
okay now how many parameters do you
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
think uh uh these current these deep
 
00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
neural networks have so if a simple line
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
has two parameters uh how many
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
parameters do these deep neural networks
 
00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.549 align:start position:0%
parameters do these deep neural networks
have

00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:48.110 align:start position:0%
have
Millions

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
Millions
 
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.590 align:start position:0%
Millions
well

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.810 --> 00:29:58.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
I think it goes back to Shannon
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
basically the number of uh
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
points that Define a waveform and the
 
00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:17.029 align:start position:0%
 
group

00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
you cannot Define a waveform with less
 
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
than two points
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and it's fuzzy but I think it comes
 
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
back to Shannon so for for a line two
 
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
points for sure but uh uh uh let's uh
 
00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
take a step back and like in neurons
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me one second I just I couldn't
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
understand what you said you started
 
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
with a line is defined by two points and
 
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
then you said how many points is it take
 
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
to define something what was the
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
something oh I'm sorry so um let me
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
rephrase that so A line is defined by
 
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
two parameters the slope and the
 
00:30:48.899 --> 00:30:50.110 align:start position:0%
two parameters the slope and the
intercept

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
intercept
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
and as I said a simple linear regression
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
is a machine learning model right it has
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
two parameters now how many parameters
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
do you think a deep neural network like
 
00:31:03.889 --> 00:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
chat GPT has that was the question
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
and and I think there was a um uh
 
00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
someone said millions who was that uh so
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
Millions is a good guess but it's
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
actually a lower bound so it's actually
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
hundreds of billions of parameters in
 
00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:21.059 align:start position:0%
fact the uh the current uh uh GPT model
 
00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to be released so in GT5 is
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
the first trillion parameter models
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
trillion parameters so that means that
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know a line you can understand it
 
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh interpretable because you
 
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
know it has two parameters you know it's
 
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
the slope and The Intercept of the line
 
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
you understand it very well now imagine
 
00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:42.299 align:start position:0%
uh if you had a uh you know model with a
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
trillion parameters
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
right it's just there's no way we can
 
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
understand how it works so even the
 
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
people who uh work on these models have
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
very little understanding of uh how they
 
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
actually work because we cannot imagine
 
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
a trillion dimensional space right it's
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
it's just uh uh outside the scope of our
 
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
understanding this is just to make the
 
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
point about uh what makes these models
 
00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
black boxes it's just the fact that they
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
have so many parameters trillions or
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds of billions that is just it's
 
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
hard to figure out exactly uh what's
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
going on inside these models that was
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
the point I was trying to make yeah I'm
 
00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
sorry but yes I just like the record to
 
00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
show that trillions is a bunch of
 
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
millions that is true so
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
hundreds of yes hundreds of or millions
 
00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
yes so yes current models have hundreds
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
of billions and again as I said the
 
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
newest one is going to have is going to
 
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
be the first trillion uh parameter model
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
and uh you know this came from this from
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
2022 but Google's uh Palm model this is
 
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
two years old already had 550 billion
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
parameters so now actually if you see
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
this uh you know what they're talking
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
about so when they talk about the number
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
of parameters they mean the number of
 
00:32:59.510 --> 00:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
mathematical parameters that explain the
 
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
model and in this case it's yes go ahead
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
is a parameter something that's
 
00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
associated with a sensor that's bringing
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
could be depending on um you know your
 
00:33:15.009 --> 00:33:15.019 align:start position:0%
your application if you have sensors
 
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
bringing in data yes
 
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
what else could it be well it's actually
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
it's more a function of the uh the model
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
itself not the data
 
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
so uh the same data so let me let me uh
 
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
give you a very simple example uh chat
 
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
gbt deals with text text is the data the
 
00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
model itself has billions hundreds of
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
billions of parameters but I could come
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
up with a very simple model with a few
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
parameters that also deals with text but
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
it's not going to perform well at all
 
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
because you know it's uh yeah it's it's
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
a it's a uh it's a let's let's put it
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
system specific uh number right so a
 
00:34:00.169 --> 00:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
chat GPT being a system it has that many
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
parameters right Dolly has these many
 
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
parameters and so on
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
it makes sense I'm just trying to get a
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
sense of what limits this is the
 
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
parameter that's a really good question
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
so the limit is how much data you have
 
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
to train your model so the more data you
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
have the more parameters you could have
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
and also your Computing uh
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure there is a reason why
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
these models are coming out of kind of
 
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
big tech companies and not Academia
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
because only Google and open Ai and meta
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
actually have the Computing resources to
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
learn these things at Dartmouth for
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
example the best you could do is you
 
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
know a few hundred million parameters
 
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
like maybe a couple of billion but
 
00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:45.899 align:start position:0%
nowhere close to what is so I'm going to
 
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
move on uh just to uh excuse me just I
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up on this this
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
thing you had here with the
 
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
hallucination now I understand you know
 
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
you say you can put something in there
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
and it'll generate a picture of a cat
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
with three heads that becomes obvious
 
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
well that's not a real cat everybody
 
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
knows that but what if it generates some
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
something much more complicated than
 
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
that and data then how does one
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
determine women if that's hallucination
 
00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
or not because people are going to look
 
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
at the outputs of these things people
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
say oh I read it on the internet it was
 
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
under this and so it's real but it's
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
actually artificial so is there any way
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
of running it through a second uh uh
 
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
scenario or some way of checking that to
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
determine what's real and what isn't
 
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question and
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
something that my lab and others are
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
working on right now the answer is
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
currently no and that's why it's a big
 
00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
issue um the uh unless it's obvious like
 
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
you said like a cat CAD with three heads
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh there's no because the model itself
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
thinks that it's true that's the problem
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
right and so it's actually there's no
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
way uh to automatically
 
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
figure out whether something is a
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
hallucination or not and that is a huge
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
issue I'll actually get to that in a
 
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
second but I just I just want to follow
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
a question so would it be possible to
 
00:35:59.329 --> 00:35:59.339 align:start position:0%
run it through Model A and it comes out
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
with some set of data and says this is
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
this is all facts and we think this the
 
00:36:05.569 --> 00:36:05.579 align:start position:0%
model thinks this is all correct if you
 
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
ran it through a separate model that was
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
different and they didn't come out the
 
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
same would that be kind of a key
 
00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
indication that one of them was wrong
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
yes uh so that's a a really good
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
suggestion it would at least tell you
 
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
that there's inconsistency right but it
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
won't tell you which one is right right
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
yeah I understand that but another
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
problem but that would be one way to do
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
it uh there are a couple of uh issues
 
00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
with that one is that there are only a
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
few of these models out there because as
 
00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:32.339 align:start position:0%
I said just because of the size you know
 
00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
there are only a few companies that
 
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
actually make can make models like that
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
and secondly they're all trained on
 
00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
publicly available data from the web and
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
so the the kind of this garbage in
 
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
garbage out principle that they're
 
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
getting the same garbage in and so you
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
know they don't have independent data
 
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
sets that trained on and that is a big
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
issue and in fact it could be creative I
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
could just interrupt for a second please
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
uh representative Harrington let's save
 
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
the questions for right after he
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
finishes his presentation which is going
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
to be real soon now right yes yes okay
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you all right so um
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just gonna uh talk a little bit
 
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
about the garbage in garbage on and the
 
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.370 align:start position:0%
about the garbage in garbage on and the
hallucination

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
hallucination
 
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
um you know I I can't skip this uh for
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
the interest of time but I just wanted
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
at least provide some uh you know uh
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
understanding of how these large
 
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
language models work it's not as I said
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
magic it's it's all it is it's what the
 
00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
model has seen in the past so let's take
 
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
an example of uh at the very bottom
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
right so like as I said large language
 
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
model is a technology that chat GPT and
 
00:37:38.329 --> 00:37:38.339 align:start position:0%
other tools use so you can for the red
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
box you can just think it says chat GPT
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
now if you pass as a user if you write I
 
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
was walking down the street and pass it
 
00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
to rgbt to complete you know it could
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
finish your sentence to make it some
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
coherent things I was walking down the
 
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:52.740 align:start position:0%
street and then it would generate when I
 
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
saw my friend for example it's just a
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
very simple example that's how these
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
things usually work they take a prompt
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
and then they generate text based on the
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
prompt that you've given at the uh
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
um the way it is work is that uh based
 
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
on the data that they have seen so this
 
00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
is the data from the web uh they uh
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
have a probability distribution of which
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
word should come next based on what is
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
already being said so you're talking
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
about I was walking down the street so
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
this is what already being said and now
 
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
the model uh has a distribution of what
 
00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
is the most likely word that comes after
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
this uh these series of words and here
 
00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
I'm showing you this is a toy example
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
but you can imagine the model so the bar
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
being the probability the model uh
 
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
thinks that okay when is pretty common
 
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
and is less common at you know is even
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
less common and so on and it randomly
 
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
picks one of these choices uh based on
 
00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:53.579 align:start position:0%
this probability distribution so it's
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
not it's not that each word has a uh has
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
likelihood of being chosen when is more
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
likely to be chosen than and because it
 
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
has a higher probability right but it is
 
00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
at the end of the the uh randomly chosen
 
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
this is important that's why if you pass
 
00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
the same prompt to uh chat gbt you can
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
get a different generation every time
 
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
because you know you could be picking a
 
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
different word every time and then once
 
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
it has it when it once it picks the
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
first word now the prompt becomes I was
 
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
walking down the street when and then
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
again it looks for the next word uh that
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
is the most probable work so when I and
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
then so on and so forth so this is a
 
00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
gross over simplification but it's it's
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
a good uh you know intuition uh to have
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
around how these large language models
 
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
work work they are at their core next
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
word prediction models they predict what
 
00:39:46.849 --> 00:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
word should come next given what's
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
already being said and that prediction
 
00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
is based on what they've seen underwear
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
right so what am I telling you this is
 
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
because well if what they've seen on the
 
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
web is garbage then and their
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
predictions are going to be garbage too
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
so garbage and garbage out and then
 
00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.870 align:start position:0%
so garbage and garbage out and then
finally

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
finally
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
um hallucination uh we already had a
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
discussion around this but uh a really
 
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
good example of this is this uh a case
 
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
that I don't know if you've heard of
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
this but in in the summer there was this
 
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
case where a lawyer in New York uh
 
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
basically wrote his whole uh legal brief
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
using chat GPT but it ended up uh GPD
 
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
ended up hallucinating a lot of legal
 
00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
cases that didn't exist so it basically
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know cited a lot of it it cited
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
legal cases that Enix exists including
 
00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:35.579 align:start position:0%
proper citations and everything and the
 
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
judge was looking for these and they
 
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
couldn't find it and anyways the lawyer
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
got into a lot of trouble but um that's
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
an example of a non you know obvious
 
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:45.740 align:start position:0%
hallucination right it looks legit
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
citations like the citations even
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
included you know years and authors or
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
everything and every and they made sense
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
for someone who actually hadn't seen the
 
00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
uh you know citations that made sense
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
and as a really good example of
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
hallucination I think for the interest
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
of time I can stop here and then take
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
more questions well I want to thank you
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
I know this is an incredibly complex
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
topic and you did a great job of
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
condensing it into something that we
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
could understand and absorb and I know
 
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
the committee has lots of questions for
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
you unfortunately we only have 20
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
minutes of questions before we have to
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
call it off but I will ask everybody to
 
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
raise your hand before uh speaking and
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
I'll call on you to to ask a question of
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
the professor so we'll go with Lucius
 
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:50.339 align:start position:0%
we have another presentation at 11.
 
00:41:50.339 --> 00:41:51.370 align:start position:0%
we have another presentation at 11.
okay

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:51.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas
 
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
um what kinds of laws are you seeing
 
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
that are specific for AI and and in
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
particular in the political world with
 
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.390 align:start position:0%
particular in the political world with
propaganda

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
propaganda
 
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339 align:start position:0%
about the use of AI for propaganda
 
00:42:11.089 --> 00:42:11.099 align:start position:0%
um just the the use of AI in general are
 
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
you seeing any specific laws being
 
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.930 align:start position:0%
you seeing any specific laws being
generated

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
generated
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
yes so uh you may know that EU is
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
actually like Germany was one of the
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
first countries to uh uh
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
specifically uh regulate the use of
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
charge gbt for public employees and if
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken I think even the state
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
of Maine had a uh you know uh hold on
 
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
the use of and others can check this for
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
me but basically public employees uh are
 
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
not allowed to use chat gbd for the next
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
couple of months as they figure out
 
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
basically what's uh what's going on I
 
00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:50.099 align:start position:0%
believe that's correct a state of Mass
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
or neighboring state
 
00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of uh other laws well
 
00:42:59.089 --> 00:42:59.099 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of discussion uh in uh EU
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
I think EU is definitely leading uh the
 
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
way for laws and regulations uh I do
 
00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:04.220 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
make a point here this is my own
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
personal opinion which is if you're
 
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
thinking about laws and regulations it's
 
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
important to have this distinction
 
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
between application and Technology right
 
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
I don't think regulating the technology
 
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
makes sense maybe regulating the
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
application of it makes sense right so
 
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
you don't want to uh you know stop
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
innovation in AI That's the technology
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
but yes applications of it I can imagine
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know potentially be something
 
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
that could be regulated representative
 
00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.130 align:start position:0%
that could be regulated representative

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
Summers
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh being a network
 
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
engineer myself I'll be the first to
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
admit I use chat BG gbt and I and I've
 
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
even cheated and downloaded python code
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
to create an API so it does work but the
 
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
question I had was is that uh I have
 
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
noticed also on searches you can get a
 
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh you know as of 2021 this is not known
 
00:43:59.210 --> 00:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
to happen as is there a oh I can I can
 
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
guess there's never going to be
 
00:44:02.089 --> 00:44:02.099 align:start position:0%
absolutely current is there like a set
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
timeline of how out of date the data
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
would be an API
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question because
 
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
these uh models are so large and so
 
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
expensive to train you cannot uh retrain
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
them often and uh the uh I believe chat
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
gbt actually if you look at at the very
 
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
bottom it says like when was the last
 
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
time it was like where was the time
 
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
frame that it was trained on I believe
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
the most recent one is uh 2022 uh like
 
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
that's like yeah but that's a really
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
good point which is uh because these are
 
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
trained on large data sets and let's say
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
they're retrained every year that means
 
00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339 align:start position:0%
that they're actually behind in terms of
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
what is common knowledge and common uh
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
understanding yeah
 
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
representative William McWilliams
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Rose thank you very much
 
00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:53.099 align:start position:0%
Professor for the presentation
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
um I have a question about blockchain in
 
00:44:59.210 --> 00:44:59.220 align:start position:0%
terms of using blockchain as part of um
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
proving where data comes from and
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
by extension
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
if there is anything we can do to set
 
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
rules for blockchain to prove data for
 
00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:14.540 align:start position:0%
just as an example deep fakes right
 
00:45:17.809 --> 00:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
blockchain would dissolve the underlying
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
supports of a deep fake because it
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
proves that it's not actually based on
 
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
the truth is there a way as
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
for us as legislators
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
to implement blockchain
 
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
checkpoints to make sure that moving
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
forward what we're seeing is the truth
 
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.710 align:start position:0%
forward what we're seeing is the truth
so

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah thank you for the question uh I
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
have to say blockchains are definitely
 
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
outside my office expertise but I can uh
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
comment a little bit on it but I can't
 
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:47.339 align:start position:0%
comment down to technology much um what
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
is uh true is that blockchain can be
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
used to in some ways a watermark you
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
know uh data uh and so and I know people
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
have been talking about it with respect
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
to uh uh deep fakes so in some ways you
 
00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:02.339 align:start position:0%
can imagine you know having a built-in
 
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh verification of all right is this is
 
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
this a real image or is it a generated
 
00:46:07.849 --> 00:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
image right
 
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
um and I know there are uh you know
 
00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
people who are working on this again
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
outside my area of expertise I do know
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
that this is much harder for text so for
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
image it's much easier than uh than for
 
00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:20.339 align:start position:0%
text because you can imagine it's hard
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
to Watermark a piece of text and there
 
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
are again
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
um discussions around this uh you know
 
00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
so maybe
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
you know you have some kind of a um
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know like mathematical function
 
00:46:35.809 --> 00:46:35.819 align:start position:0%
encoded into the text that to the uh to
 
00:46:37.609 --> 00:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
the you know naked eye it just looks
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
like a act like a normal piece of text
 
00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
but if you run it through this you know
 
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
analysis tool it'll tell you whether it
 
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
was generated by an AI or by human there
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
are discussions around this um but I
 
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
don't know of anything that's really
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
taken off and again I not being an
 
00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
expert on blockchains I can't really
 
00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
comment more than that yeah mm-hmm
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative muttons has a question
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you maybe as a follow-up to that
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
and what you had said earlier
 
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.230 align:start position:0%
and what you had said earlier
um

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:07.700 align:start position:0%
if if if
 
00:47:10.609 --> 00:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
we were to do or any legislature were to
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
do any type of Regulation where where
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
should the regulation focus should it be
 
00:47:15.839 --> 00:47:17.030 align:start position:0%
should the regulation focus should it be
on

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
the data that's going into the black box
 
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
the Black Box itself or requiring that
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
there be some kind of human
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
check on the output to control against
 
00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
hallucinations or is it all of the above
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
um one uh kind of idea that's been uh
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
that we've been talking about in
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
academic circles is uh creating what we
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
call a model nutrition labels you know
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
how food have uh nutritional labels of
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
you know what goes in them so at the
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
very least
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
requiring uh some kind of a uh like a
 
00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:57.140 align:start position:0%
like a label that explains uh exactly
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
where the data for this model came from
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
you know what are the potential issues
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
with the data all of those things I
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
think that would be the very least that
 
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
can be done so it won't stop uh the uh
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
the development of these applications
 
00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:14.220 align:start position:0%
but at least consumers they know what
 
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
they're getting right right now you know
 
00:48:17.569 --> 00:48:17.579 align:start position:0%
chat GPD they don't know exactly so
 
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
having what we call like a model
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
nutrition label I mean it's a bad term
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
but uh that that I think would be
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
um would be very useful and then the
 
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
other um
 
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
uh and by the way these nutrition labels
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
could be then uh part of it could be
 
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
having uh human oversight so in order to
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
actually get the label maybe you need to
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
have uh you know some human oversight uh
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
over the generation or uh or over the uh
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
you know data that's actually used to
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
train these models uh and um the other
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
area which I think uh would be you know
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
useful to look at and this is a little
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
bit for selfish reasons because I do
 
00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
work in Academia but uh I think a big
 
00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
issue with current uh uh advances in AI
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of is driven by industry
 
00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
because of the uh again the resources
 
00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
required to create such models and we
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
try to play catch-up and we try to
 
00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:17.099 align:start position:0%
actually you know take a step back and
 
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
analyze these models and figure out
 
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
exactly what's wrong with them but I
 
00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:23.339 align:start position:0%
think uh you know uh having uh I'm not
 
00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:26.339 align:start position:0%
sure you can force corporations to to uh
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know uh partner with academics but
 
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
having some uh venue uh some some uh you
 
00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
know uh I guess uh way for academics to
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
get access to some of these models would
 
00:49:40.849 --> 00:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
be very useful so we can use these
 
00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
models like everyone else can but we're
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
not actually given access to the uh
 
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
training data to the model architecture
 
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
or anything like that so you know if you
 
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
had access to these we could definitely
 
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:55.140 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know look at some of these
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
issues and come up with methods to
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
mitigate them but we don't have access
 
00:49:59.690 --> 00:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
to them so access to academics I think
 
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
would be another possible event you know
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
way to do this representative Harrington
 
00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman let me take my
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
question just a follow-up to what we
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
were talking about with the
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
hallucination stuff I'm just trying to
 
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
figure it so it generates a product that
 
00:50:16.849 --> 00:50:16.859 align:start position:0%
comes out that may be inaccurate but the
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
model believes it is accurate now so
 
00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:20.780 align:start position:0%
that presents
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
presents some more results does that
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
results then go back into the data
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
package so that if a similar question or
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question is answered now
 
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's being based on what we what is
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
possibly false consumptions from the
 
00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:35.579 align:start position:0%
first hallucination which only
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
perpetuates itself for making the second
 
00:50:40.609 --> 00:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
one worse does it yeah that way uh
 
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
that's a great question uh it doesn't
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
work immediately like that but a big
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
concern is exactly what you said which
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
is uh people are going to be using these
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
tools a lot like and they're going to
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
produce new data and that data is going
 
00:50:56.089 --> 00:50:56.099 align:start position:0%
to be a you know posted on the web and
 
00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:58.140 align:start position:0%
the next version of chat gbt is going to
 
00:50:59.690 --> 00:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
be using that data and so it's going to
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
basically have this feedback loop where
 
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
absolutely if they're like you know
 
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
hallucinations in the data you could
 
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
just kept get getting fed back into the
 
00:51:08.809 --> 00:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
models and that is a huge issue
 
00:51:08.819 --> 00:51:11.510 align:start position:0%
models and that is a huge issue
absolutely

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative Gorman has a question
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
given that the Deep neural Nets are
 
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
currently incapable of producing an
 
00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
explanation for their output has there
 
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
been research to modify them so that
 
00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
they can produce an explanation
 
00:51:32.809 --> 00:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question as well um
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
yes including some from my own lab so uh
 
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
we there's been kind of two uh
 
00:51:41.809 --> 00:51:41.819 align:start position:0%
directions taken one is uh what we call
 
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
kind of post-talk interpretability
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
method so you're given a model let's say
 
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
chat gbd and then our tools try to
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
interpret how these models work you can
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
think of it as kind of a uh you know a
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
behavioral scientist trying to
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
understand how you know dogs you know
 
00:52:02.329 --> 00:52:02.339 align:start position:0%
make decisions or something like that
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
that's one way the other is to actually
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
change the models uh
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
from the beginning so that they are
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
inherently interpretable so instead of
 
00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
you know kind of doing this post hoc all
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
right we have a model now let's try to
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
interpret it what if you actually had
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
models ever you know inherently uh
 
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
interpretable so we are working on that
 
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
uh it is it is uh you know the first
 
00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:27.059 align:start position:0%
area has you know Advanced quite a bit
 
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
so these post hoc methods the second
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
area is a very new area of research
 
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
which is uh making uh neural networks
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
internally interpretable one of the
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
issues uh as I said earlier is the fact
 
00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:41.579 align:start position:0%
that um it's it's uh it's hard for
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
academics to work with such large models
 
00:52:45.049 --> 00:52:45.059 align:start position:0%
just within the resources we have in
 
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
Academia and so as I said like if if
 
00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
there was some kind of
 
00:52:53.569 --> 00:52:53.579 align:start position:0%
way to partner with corporations uh uh
 
00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
to give us access to these models I
 
00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
think it would really speed up the
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
development of such uh such Solutions
 
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.130 align:start position:0%
development of such uh such Solutions
yeah

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:01.140 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative McGee did you have a
 
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
question I do thank you yes
 
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
um this conversation is just getting
 
00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:08.990 align:start position:0%
um this conversation is just getting
interesting

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
um I was just going to say to follow on
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about now
 
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh going back to garbage in garbage out
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
if the systems have this incredible
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
exponential capability to be able to
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
review the data then it kind of comes
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
down to the sort of the Prime directives
 
00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
that are being given to it by who
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
whoever is creating these applications
 
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.690 align:start position:0%
whoever is creating these applications
to

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
put some
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
or maybe government really needs to play
 
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
that role of trying to put in uh
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
quality in terms of output right because
 
00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
it it won't do it on its own so it has
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
to be like a prime directive like an
 
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
iRobot that you can't hurt humans or
 
00:53:53.089 --> 00:53:53.099 align:start position:0%
whatever right you have to
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
maybe have government be responsible for
 
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
making sure that the folks who control
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
the data
 
00:54:02.569 --> 00:54:02.579 align:start position:0%
uh don't have so much power over that
 
00:54:05.569 --> 00:54:05.579 align:start position:0%
data that it then harms the citizens so
 
00:54:08.809 --> 00:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
I you know I think from the conversation
 
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
that we've had so far I I come from a
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
systems background I was a program
 
00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
manager in software engineering and I
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
know that unless you define the things
 
00:54:20.329 --> 00:54:20.339 align:start position:0%
up front that are your objectives for
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
those applications and unless people in
 
00:54:26.089 --> 00:54:26.099 align:start position:0%
government understand the objectives of
 
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:29.339 align:start position:0%
each then we may not be giving the
 
00:54:29.339 --> 00:54:30.849 align:start position:0%
each then we may not be giving the
correct

00:54:30.849 --> 00:54:30.859 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
inputs uh up front for having the
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
applications provide what they could
 
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
provide right we can keep them on the
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
good path
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
at least it seems like that's where
 
00:54:43.609 --> 00:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
we're at right now is trying to figure
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
out how do we keep them on the good pass
 
00:54:48.609 --> 00:54:48.619 align:start position:0%
and I think government can interject
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
that universities
 
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
um be part of the process rather than
 
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
having it all be in private Industries
 
00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
hands because I think you get different
 
00:54:58.500 --> 00:54:59.990 align:start position:0%
hands because I think you get different
outcomes

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
00:55:03.609 --> 00:55:03.619 align:start position:0%
yes I agree with that and you know uh
 
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
the other than obviously academics
 
00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
having different goals than people
 
00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
working in the corporate world we're
 
00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:10.619 align:start position:0%
more interested in you know kind of
 
00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:11.819 align:start position:0%
scientific understanding of what's going
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
on we're also um you know there's a lot
 
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
of us we had a lot of graduate students
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
so we can really study these systems at
 
00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:21.059 align:start position:0%
scale so I agree with you 100 and in
 
00:55:23.329 --> 00:55:23.339 align:start position:0%
terms of um uh what you were saying
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
earlier I think an analogy I sometimes
 
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
use is you know um you have research
 
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
let's say you're looking at uh for uh
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
you know uh pharmaceutical research
 
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
right so the research being done on
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
drugs the actual technology right it's
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
done in labs and uh you know there's
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
very little usually for the research
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
itself there's little government
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
oversight but then once you want to move
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
that technology to a real world
 
00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:47.579 align:start position:0%
application like a drug then you have
 
00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
the FDA basically uh making sure that it
 
00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:52.859 align:start position:0%
passes certain muster before it can be
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
deployed in the real world right I think
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
we can make it same analogy here where
 
00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
we can you know leave the technology
 
00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
alone more or less or let it develop in
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
Labs but then once they're being moved
 
00:56:05.089 --> 00:56:05.099 align:start position:0%
to real world applications like chat
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
chipity and address then some Department
 
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
like the FDA but for AI you know where
 
00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
they can just take these models and then
 
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
they can verify the same way FDA you
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
know verifies drugs to make sure that
 
00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
they're safe for public consumption I
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
think that would be a good compromise it
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
it removes any kind of hurdle for taking
 
00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
a lot technological development but it
 
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
also protects the public
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask the final question and
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative McGee's
 
00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
question by saying or by asking if
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
these applications are scraping the web
 
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
for data and we know how huge
 
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
the amount of data is
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
is it even possible to control
 
00:56:51.049 --> 00:56:51.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.059 --> 00:56:51.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:53.809 --> 00:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
the short answer is no
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
so we can't control it but you know we
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
can try to at least understand it and
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
provide some insight but yes it's uh if
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
if we are going to continue relying on
 
00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
the web as a source of data it's uh
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
almost impossible to completely control
 
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
this output
 
00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
well I want to thank you very much for a
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
very stimulating and exciting
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
presentation and discussion and I
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
commend you for
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
condensing it down to a a one-hour
 
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
period that we could actually
 
00:57:26.329 --> 00:57:26.339 align:start position:0%
get something out of we really
 
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
appreciate it you did an excellent job
 
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me thank you
 
00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman will the slides be available
 
00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
say again the slides that he used but
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
he'd be available can you make your
 
00:57:41.329 --> 00:57:41.339 align:start position:0%
slides available sure uh who do I need
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
to send it to send them to okay yes okay
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
all right uh we're gonna start our next
 
00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
presentation in two minutes if you need
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
to go to the bathroom uh while our next
 
00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
presenter gets set up we'll wait until
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh just about 11 o'clock and then we'll
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
okay let's resume our activity for this
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
morning before we get to our next
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
presenter I just want to provide one
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
piece of information for members of the
 
01:01:58.559 --> 01:01:59.870 align:start position:0%
piece of information for members of the
committee

01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:02:02.089 --> 01:02:02.099 align:start position:0%
you may have noticed that one of our
 
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
members Troy murner is not here this
 
01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:06.500 align:start position:0%
morning and that's because
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative merner resigned his seat
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh last week so he's no longer a member
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
of the house or obviously a member of
 
01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
I'm currently working with speaker
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
Sharon Packard to find a new member for
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
our committee and that person hopefully
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
will be in attendance uh with the rest
 
01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
of us early next month
 
01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm going to ask
 
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:35.220 align:start position:0%
representative Corbin to introduce our
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
next speaker
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my pleasure to
 
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
introduce Meredith anguin as a working
 
01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
chemist Meredith anguin headed projects
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
that lowered pollution and increased
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
reliability on the electric grid her
 
01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
work included pollution control for
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
nitrogen oxides and gas-fired combustion
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
turbines and corrosion control and
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
geothermal and nuclear systems she was
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
one of the first women to be a project
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
manager at the Electric Power Research
 
01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
Institute where she led projects in
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
renewable and nuclear energy
 
01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
in the past 10 years she began to study
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
and take part in Grid oversight and
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
governance for four years she served on
 
01:03:17.809 --> 01:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
the Coordinating Committee for the
 
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
consumer liaison group associated with
 
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
ISO New England her our local grid
 
01:03:26.329 --> 01:03:26.339 align:start position:0%
operator and Ms anguin teaches courses
 
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
and presents workshops on the electric
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
grid she is also an advocate for nuclear
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
energy her previous major book was
 
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839 align:start position:0%
campaigning for clean air strategies for
 
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
pro-nuclear advocacy she's been a
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
featured speaker at several nuclear
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
events including being a keynote for the
 
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
worldwide nuclear science week in 2018
 
01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:51.380 align:start position:0%
on a personal note I started noticing
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
Meredith popping up on my own Twitter
 
01:03:59.450 --> 01:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
feed now known as X feed and I
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
ultimately realized that she lives in
 
01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
Wild River romant which is you know I
 
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
can almost throw a stone there so I had
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
lunch with her a few months ago and
 
01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:11.940 align:start position:0%
asked if she'd be willing to give us a
 
01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
presentation and here she is so thank
 
01:04:16.809 --> 01:04:16.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for asking me I'm
 
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
very happy to be here
 
01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:22.789 align:start position:0%
very happy to be here
and

01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:22.799 --> 01:04:24.289 align:start position:0%
and
uh

01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:24.299 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
so this is just the beginning slide as
 
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
you can see it says who I am and where
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
we are and luckily for me uh uh
 
01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Corman did a lovely
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
introduction so I don't have to uh write
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
a lot about it uh right to talk about
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
all this I just want to say that I was
 
01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
active in the consumer and liaison group
 
01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
of iso New England and I also have this
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
book shorting the grid the hidden
 
01:04:59.809 --> 01:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
fragility of our electric grid which has
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
gotten quite a lot of
 
01:05:01.559 --> 01:05:04.450 align:start position:0%
gotten quite a lot of
circulation

01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:04.460 align:start position:0%
circulation
 
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
I want to start by saying that uh
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
my pilot My Philosophy is very much that
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
this a strong grid is a reliable grid a
 
01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
reliable grid is extremely important and
 
01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
if you go to anywhere where they don't
 
01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
have a reliable grid they'll tell you
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
that and the next thing is relatively
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
inexpensive electricity so electricity
 
01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
can be used for health and happiness and
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
electricity made with low levels of
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
pollution and ecosystem disruption
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
so here's the that's I just wanted to
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
say that first because sometimes you
 
01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:44.579 align:start position:0%
hear a presentation on the grid and it
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
sounds like the purpose of the grid is
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
to be Net Zero that is something that a
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
grid can be May should be but it isn't
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the grid the purpose of
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
the grid is to make reliable electricity
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
so here's my presentation outline
 
01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
and uh the I'm going to talk first about
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
the physical grid and the policy grid
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
there are really two grids that people
 
01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
talk about and they get them confused a
 
01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
little or maybe they mean to get them
 
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
confused the physical grid you can see
 
01:06:21.289 --> 01:06:21.299 align:start position:0%
it out your window okay there's
 
01:06:22.849 --> 01:06:22.859 align:start position:0%
transmission there's distribution
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
there's substations there's Dispatchers
 
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the balancing Authority
 
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
operators room there's linemen there's
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
generators there's end users and it's
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
mostly limited by physics not by
 
01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:39.799 align:start position:0%
regulations what happens on that grid
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
policy grid includes things like Net
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
Zero net metering renewable portfolio
 
01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
standards and so forth and to be honest
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
the policy grid is mostly about how the
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
physical grid is paid
 
01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
paid and policy is kind of the same word
 
01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
so here's a situation where the two
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
grids were confused uh Vermont Yankee
 
01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
was a nuclear plant and it had contracts
 
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
with Vermont utilities that ended in
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
2012. and it continued operations
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
selling into the grid operator auctions
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
until 2014.
 
01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
in 2013 anti-nuclear people said you can
 
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
shut it down we don't need it we're not
 
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
even using it now but we were using it
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
because Vermont Yankee was putting power
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
on the grid and people were using it
 
01:07:31.609 --> 01:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
changing a contract does not change the
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
wires and it's very important to keep
 
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
that in mind or you can get really
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
misled by people who have some advocacy
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
position or not or people who are just
 
01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:44.089 align:start position:0%
position or not or people who are just
confused

01:07:44.089 --> 01:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
confused
 
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
and there's as I've been working on this
 
01:07:51.049 --> 01:07:51.059 align:start position:0%
I realized there's actually a third grid
 
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
and they're multiplying uh it's the
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
could Grid it's the grid you usually
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
hear about uh it's so good that's in the
 
01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:03.020 align:start position:0%
Sunday Sunday paper
 
01:08:06.529 --> 01:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
for example with battery breakthroughs
 
01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:09.299 align:start position:0%
we could use just wind and solar
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
forget those Legacy plans because
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
something is just around the corner now
 
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
I want to tell you that I worked at the
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
Electric Power Research institution we
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
did research and research does not turn
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
into deployment very quickly so I have
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
concentrated on the grid we have and I
 
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
find that people know comparatively
 
01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
little about it compared to the could
 
01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.729 align:start position:0%
little about it compared to the could
grid

01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
so let's start with the grid we have
 
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
and I want to talk about Regional
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
transmission organizations first
 
01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
I have a friend in Chicago who's very
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable very I went to University
 
01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
of Chicago with me and she had no idea I
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
said to her how is it being in pjm in
 
01:08:58.610 --> 01:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
the middle of myso she didn't know what
 
01:09:00.289 --> 01:09:00.299 align:start position:0%
I was talking about
 
01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
but here's what I was talking about
 
01:09:04.209 --> 01:09:04.219 align:start position:0%
these are the regional transmission
 
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
organizations and you can see that the
 
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
pjm area uh was
 
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
um was meant to be it started out as
 
01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania Jersey Maryland that's why
 
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
it's pjm and you notice that it's
 
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
Chicago too meanwhile most of the middle
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
west is on uh is miso uh Mid-Continent
 
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
in uh ISO then there's a Southwest power
 
01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
pool and the one we've all heard of this
 
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
is the one everybody sort of ercot
 
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
anybody ever heard that is the grid of
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
of most well-known Creed in the country
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
so you say okay those are the regional
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
transmission organizations that operate
 
01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
in a certain way what's all the white
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
space the white spaces areas that have
 
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
the traditional vertically integrated
 
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
utilities that are mostly controlled by
 
01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
a combination of their Public Utilities
 
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
commissions and the Federal Energy
 
01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission the RTO areas have
 
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
a layer of of control that is uh the the
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
well the
 
01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.130 align:start position:0%
well the
um

01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
Regional transmission organization and
 
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
and and sometimes they're called isos
 
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
and there's there's a little bit of
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
difference between the two but don't
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
worry about it if it's an ISO or an RTO
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
it acts a certain way
 
01:10:32.209 --> 01:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
so here's the two major tribes of of
 
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
grid governance there are traditional
 
01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated utilities where
 
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
the utility is responsible for
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
reliability it owns power plants and
 
01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:45.659 align:start position:0%
Distribution Systems transmission is a
 
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
little more complicated because ferc is
 
01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
a very
 
01:10:49.739 --> 01:10:50.330 align:start position:0%
a very
um

01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
has a lot of control uh feds have a lot
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
of control on transmission it receives a
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
rate of returns set by regulations that
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
is if it invests a million dollars in a
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
new power plant it's Public Utilities
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
Commission will say you can regain that
 
01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
million dollars from the rate payers and
 
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
you can um
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
you can get an eight percent rate of
 
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
return on that million dollars as your
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
profit the Public Utility Commission has
 
01:11:21.169 --> 01:11:21.179 align:start position:0%
to say that or it can't get any of the
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
that the puc has that control and
 
01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
um in an RTO area which is sometimes
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
called deregulated but please
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
nobody is ultimately responsible uh for
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
the reliability I'm sorry to say that
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
but it is true the merchant generators
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
Supply Power they are not owned by your
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
a local utility they do not have a
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
strong obligation to be on all the time
 
01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact they aren't
 
01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh distribution utilities by that power
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
and auctions run by the rtos so for
 
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
example if you
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you
 
01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
if you're a a rural Cooperative say and
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
you don't have your own power plant but
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh you can get power two ways you can
 
01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
make a power purchase agreement with a
 
01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
power plant or uh you can get your power
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
at an auction run by the uh rtos and the
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
the rules for these auctions and the
 
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
rules for uh what the puc is allowed to
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
do and what the RTO is allowed to do
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
they are very complex and in my opinion
 
01:12:32.689 --> 01:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
quite easily games now a lot of people
 
01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
would be mad at me for saying that but
 
01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
what do I mean by easily gamed
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
well first of all I want to show you
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
what we we owe so much to these people
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
this is the control room at ISO New
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
England and it is a control room
 
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
everywhere the the the name for a
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
control room is the balancing Authority
 
01:12:59.090 --> 01:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
well it's also called the control room
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
but various things with the grid
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
operator does includes paying the plants
 
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
and so forth and so on but the balancing
 
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
Authority is the ultimate
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility Place uh they they keep
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
the demand the amount of electricity
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
used and the supply the amount produced
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
in Balance all the time so they're the
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
ones who would say this power plant has
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
to go on now we're getting we're getting
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
a spike in demand or they would say
 
01:13:31.729 --> 01:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
we're going to start rolling blackouts
 
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
or they would say we've got three
 
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
companies that are the demands going up
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
and up and we don't have more to meet it
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
we have three companies that have told
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
us they're in for demand resource we can
 
01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
tell them to shut down and they will
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
they were telling them to shut down so
 
01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
these are the people who do it and
 
01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
there's several different desks uh it's
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
not just one person doing it there's
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
several different desks looking at
 
01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
things like how the pipe gas pipelines
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
are going LNG tanker tracking and the
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
first time I was there I was like what's
 
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
with the big TV screens well the thing
 
01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:08.300 align:start position:0%
is the big TV screens are about uh
 
01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
activities in the area that might affect
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
demand I think instead of talking about
 
01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
that I'll I'll mention uh the uh the the
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
big example is is is Britain okay uh in
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
Britain lots of people watch the soccer
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
games and there are breaks in the soccer
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
games and at that point everybody uh
 
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
plugs in their electric kettle so uh
 
01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
what happens is that the the grid
 
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
operators are watching the soccer games
 
01:14:38.570 --> 01:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
so they know to order plants online when
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
the electric kettles come on so anyway
 
01:14:42.649 --> 01:14:42.659 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of thing it's
 
01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:45.620 align:start position:0%
complicated to do
 
01:14:49.729 --> 01:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
and this is uh this is a slide that Phil
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
hands are used I turned out I was giving
 
01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
a talk and Phil Hansel was giving a talk
 
01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
and I said Phil I haven't seen you for
 
01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
decades we were both at every together
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
so at any rate let me just say this is
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
his slide and uh it shows the different
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
um the different usage okay so you have
 
01:15:10.330 --> 01:15:10.340 align:start position:0%
a base load which is nuclear coal uh
 
01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
combined heat and power uh minimum
 
01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:15.780 align:start position:0%
operating letters for gas and oil
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
thermal there's this whole thing about
 
01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
minimum dispatch you can't tell a plant
 
01:15:22.729 --> 01:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
to put out less than it would be stable
 
01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
at putting out and some Hydro then
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
intermediate rolled gas oil thermal
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
hydro and then Peak load which would be
 
01:15:35.209 --> 01:15:35.219 align:start position:0%
gas peaking turbine hydro and pumped
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
hydro and demand response so those are
 
01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
the different uh different uh levels of
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh okay this um
 
01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
this is a picture of the problem that
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
all grids have which is varying demand
 
01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty old picture but it
 
01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
doesn't change that much so you see the
 
01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
the uh the forecast to demand I took
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
this picture or two in the afternoon 2
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
45 uh screenshot the forecasted Demand
 
01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
on the iso New England system is the
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
blue line and the actual demand is the
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
orange line and they're tracking each
 
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
other pretty well and and the grid
 
01:16:20.689 --> 01:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
operator is is using the blue line as
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
his base and then trying to figure out
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
what's really going on uh with the uh
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
Orange Line okay now um
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to say something which is
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
like where is this picture misleading
 
01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.870 align:start position:0%
like where is this picture misleading
you

01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
that line isn't zero it's the bottom
 
01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
that line is ten thousand megawatts in
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
other words the amount of power needed
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
on the grid it doesn't fall below ten
 
01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
thousand megawatts in this picture
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
and I think that's important to remember
 
01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
because people uh don't don't they say
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
there is no such thing as base load I
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
said well what is that 10 000 megawatts
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.729 --> 01:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
so let's look for a moment at how the
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
rtos work the energy auctions uh the
 
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
energy auctions run every five minutes
 
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
it's economic dispatch which means the
 
01:17:24.169 --> 01:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
highest price plant sets the clearing
 
01:17:27.169 --> 01:17:27.179 align:start position:0%
price for all plants so let's say that
 
01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:29.219 align:start position:0%
we have a plant that bids in a twenty
 
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
dollars per megawatt hour another 30 and
 
01:17:34.729 --> 01:17:34.739 align:start position:0%
plan C at 40 and the grid operator needs
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
all of them all the plants a b and c
 
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
will get the Forty dollar per megawatt
 
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
clearing price now if the grid operator
 
01:17:47.689 --> 01:17:47.699 align:start position:0%
doesn't need some of them it says okay I
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
need a and I need B but sorry I see
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
you're out of it this time we just don't
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
have that much demand then all the
 
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
plants will get the uh thirty dollar
 
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
clearing price
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's pretty straightforward
 
01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
except that
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes it isn't
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
so I want to show you a little bit about
 
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
base load remember I told you that that
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
10K is 10 000 megawatts that's on the
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
grid all the time that's needed on the
 
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
grid all the time okay so these uh our
 
01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
size of courtesy of Israel
 
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
Senator veranche who's the founder of a
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
group called radiant value management
 
01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
and it's about New York it's about base
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
load in New York
 
01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:38.219 align:start position:0%
so here's New York City
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh from January to December in uh 19 uh
 
01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.110 align:start position:0%
uh from January to December in uh 19 uh
2021

01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
and the jaggedy thing is the amount of
 
01:18:50.890 --> 01:18:50.900 align:start position:0%
Demand on the grid which as you can see
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
gets really big in July and August right
 
01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's the big time that's the
 
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh
 
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
air conditioning time now
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
I don't like to get into what's going to
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
happen but if you think about we're
 
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
going to Electrify heating also what do
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
you think is going to happen to this
 
01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.330 align:start position:0%
you think is going to happen to this
diagram

01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
diagram
 
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
it's going to go way up in the winter in
 
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
the winter also and you notice that he
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
has um
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh the highest that it gets is uh eight
 
01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
thousand eight hundred and thirty seven
 
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
megawatts and if you remember our entire
 
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
grid was getting up to 14 000 megawatts
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
and this is a New York City alone going
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
up to 8 000. and the lowest is three
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
thousand so really
 
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
somewhere between the intraday low and
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
the minimum average somewhere around
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
4000 megawatts is needed all the time
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
and at Peak it goes to eight thousand
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
now somebody's going to say to me yeah
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
Meredith that's the city that never
 
01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
so here is the uh another slide that he
 
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
did where he went around to the
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
different areas in New York City and he
 
01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.490 align:start position:0%
different areas in New York City and he
put

01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
put
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
um again for 2020 but this is for the a
 
01:20:16.130 --> 01:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
whole year okay this isn't by month this
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
is by area
 
01:20:22.370 --> 01:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
and uh so um for example capital is the
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
Albany area Genesee is up up by
 
01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
Rochester Long Island is Long Island New
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
York City is New York City I think it's
 
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward and and you can
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
look up these areas uh uh anyway that's
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
not the point is that the the Orange is
 
01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
what's there all the time on the grid
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
what's needed all the time on the grid
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the yellow is what is the jaggedy
 
01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
part above that lower line
 
01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.350 align:start position:0%
part above that lower line
okay

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.450 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:59.630 --> 01:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
then he did an analysis of it and it
 
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
turns out New York City is not an
 
01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
outlier New York City is 65 percent
 
01:21:12.169 --> 01:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
um uh 24 7 demand okay but everything
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
else is is 66 68 61 62 there's one
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
that's a 54. but what I'm trying to say
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
is if somebody says there ain't no such
 
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
thing as Grace base load
 
01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
um well you can say there ain't no such
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
thing as a free lunch either so you do
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
need that base load you need the
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay now I'm going to go on to talking
 
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
about the Grid in Winter because around
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
here that is the tense time on the grid
 
01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
and I do want to be sure that I don't go
 
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
over so I'm keep looking over there okay
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
that clock is just a few minutes fast
 
01:21:57.490 --> 01:21:57.500 align:start position:0%
just FYI thank goodness thank you
 
01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to show you the Texas energy
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
crisis because it's sort of like our
 
01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
energy crisis but it was much more
 
01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
spectacular and got a lot of of coverage
 
01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.370 align:start position:0%
spectacular and got a lot of of coverage
so

01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
this is in 2021
 
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
and this is from the eai Energy
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
Information Administration and this is
 
01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
urcot the one RTO you've all heard of so
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
it turned out
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
that at the beginning on Sunday February
 
01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
7th we urquhot was doing great with uh
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
20 gigawatts of wind now you understand
 
01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
that our our little grid only goes up to
 
01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
20 gigahertz of wind okay
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
and that's big for us
 
01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
but then the wind died down and the
 
01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
weather got colder and so as is expected
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
natural gas was on the job that's what
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
is the grid backup when the wind dies
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
down the natural gas is the backup and
 
01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
just to some extent every every time you
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
put until something changes I'm not
 
01:23:09.649 --> 01:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
looking forward to uh how it's all going
 
01:23:11.810 --> 01:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
to be different but until something
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
changes every time you put on a wind
 
01:23:17.149 --> 01:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
turbine you better have natural gas
 
01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
around or you or or maybe something else
 
01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
so fuel is key for winter reliability oh
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
I have to go back to this for a minute
 
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
this drop here
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
was when they couldn't get natural gas
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
the drop around Sunday night I was
 
01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
actually up watching it I was so I I
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
knew they were going to have to shed
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
load it was just they did
 
01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
and uh they they led to blackouts one of
 
01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
the problems with blackouts is they
 
01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
planted a blackout would last for an
 
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
hour and then the power would go back on
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
and then they'd black out a different
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
area that's called a rolling blackout
 
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
because the area that is blacked out
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
goes from one place to another
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
but actually what happened is they
 
01:24:08.630 --> 01:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't roll them and so places were
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
blacked out for 48 hours
 
01:24:13.370 --> 01:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
which led to what 200 deaths something
 
01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
like that I don't know
 
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
so fuel is key for rental reliability
 
01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
what what was the problem with the
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
natural gas there were a lot of problems
 
01:24:26.330 --> 01:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
with it but one of them is that natural
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
gas is delivered as needed and something
 
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
tend to interfere with that delivery a
 
01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
pipe can be turned off there can be too
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
much requirement for how Heating and
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
natural gas and that that that is fuel
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
stored on site is key for winter
 
01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.689 align:start position:0%
stored on site is key for winter
reliability

01:24:46.689 --> 01:24:46.699 align:start position:0%
reliability
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:24:53.209 --> 01:24:53.219 align:start position:0%
oil coal and nuclear reactor fuel are
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
there they're just there okay uh and
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
other types of fuel can be replenished
 
01:25:02.689 --> 01:25:02.699 align:start position:0%
by delivery Water behind the dam is
 
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:10.630 --> 01:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
okay so our grid operator in 2018
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
had a very successful program
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
and there's a ISO New England cold
 
01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
weather reports you can find it on the
 
01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
web and I say New England and anyway
 
01:25:24.290 --> 01:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
um this is a report that was done on
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
this and this show what what I saw New
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
England did was it said okay the um the
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
power plants won't be able to get
 
01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
natural gas we can see this coming
 
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be very cold and
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh there's going to be demand for
 
01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
um Home Heating and it's just not going
 
01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
to be a good scene so they said okay we
 
01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:49.340 align:start position:0%
are going to underwrite
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
generators keeping oil on site there are
 
01:25:56.570 --> 01:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
many what's called dual fire generators
 
01:25:59.330 --> 01:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
that can burn either oil or natural gas
 
01:26:02.169 --> 01:26:02.179 align:start position:0%
and we're going to keep
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
underwrite them keeping oil on site it
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't a hundred percent but it was like
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
we know that you don't want to do this
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
because you can't promise to get
 
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for it but we're going to
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
help you do it
 
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
so here's exactly what happened uh that
 
01:26:21.649 --> 01:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
month I I have a book but I didn't put
 
01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
this in the book because everybody told
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
me that it's invisible
 
01:26:29.209 --> 01:26:29.219 align:start position:0%
the green is the oil that was purchased
 
01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
through the iso New England reliability
 
01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:32.629 align:start position:0%
through the iso New England reliability
program

01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
the little
 
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
blue at the top is generators that
 
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
didn't have the iso reliability program
 
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
and also purchase some oil
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
so that that program kind of worked you
 
01:26:47.639 --> 01:26:49.850 align:start position:0%
so that that program kind of worked you
know

01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
it was near failure though because this
 
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
the same report for myself New England
 
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
oil uh depleted on site
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
it started out they could get nine days
 
01:27:12.169 --> 01:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
worth of oil and then as the uh but they
 
01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
only on the first of on December had
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
like eight days work of oil then things
 
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
began getting really cold and and and
 
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
they weren't able to get gas and by the
 
01:27:26.689 --> 01:27:26.699 align:start position:0%
9th of January they had one day's worth
 
01:27:27.649 --> 01:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
of oil
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
well it worked it warmed up
 
01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
also oil can be delivered uh more easily
 
01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
than natural gas if it's being used by
 
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
homes for heating
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
so here's my okay so far
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
I have been very much just the facts
 
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
ma'am I tried to give you just facts I'm
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
now going to be opinionated
 
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.729 --> 01:27:58.739 align:start position:0%
my feeling is there's a fatal Trifecta
 
01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
for a grid there's over-reliance on
 
01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
Renewables that start and stop at their
 
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
own schedule like when all that wind
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
died out in in in in Texas
 
01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
or and backing up the Renewables with
 
01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
natural gas delivered just in time
 
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
through Pipelines
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
and things can interfere with that
 
01:28:24.410 --> 01:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
delivery it can be rooted to homes there
 
01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:27.780 align:start position:0%
can be freezings freezing wet valves all
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of stuff and the third part of the
 
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.310 align:start position:0%
kinds of stuff and the third part of the
trifecta

01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
trifecta
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
is well we'll get some from The
 
01:28:33.719 --> 01:28:34.910 align:start position:0%
is well we'll get some from The
Neighbors

01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
Neighbors
 
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
let me tell you the neighbors are having
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
the same weather you're having and I
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
first noticed this years ago before when
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
I was just writing a Blog I wasn't
 
01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
writing my book I hadn't joined the
 
01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:48.300 align:start position:0%
consumer liaison group we had a real
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
cold spell and all of a sudden we were
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
getting about half the energy from Hydro
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
Quebec that we usually get hey wait a
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
minute guys you're supposed to help us
 
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
no they had their own problems and they
 
01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
could not send us more than than they
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
usually sent as a matter of fact they
 
01:29:08.689 --> 01:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
sent less and uh in the winter
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
um they are the report that I mentioned
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
if you look at the footnotes
 
01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
the winter operations report that I've
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
quoted before you look at the footnotes
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
it turns out that a hydro Quebec makes a
 
01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.350 align:start position:0%
it turns out that a hydro Quebec makes a
um

01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
a capacity Supply application that's
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
about half of what they usually send us
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
so when they stop sending us in much and
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
they sent us half they were not
 
01:29:40.209 --> 01:29:40.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
so natural gas is a just in time
 
01:29:46.729 --> 01:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
delivery and in an ordinary day our God
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
our grid runs around 50 percent natural
 
01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
gas fired in Winter power plants compete
 
01:29:54.770 --> 01:29:54.780 align:start position:0%
with homes for natural gas and people
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
run space heaters which increases the uh
 
01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:01.139 align:start position:0%
neutral electricity and that's how oil
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
I mean I I have two of those sorry about
 
01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:11.810 align:start position:0%
I mean I I have two of those sorry about
that

01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
when I'd put two of them on therefore
 
01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
okay New England
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh after that you would say this is a
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
really good story and it ended happily
 
01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
but first said no no
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
you're into reliability program is not
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
fuel neutral it's not Market based and
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
so you have got to think of something
 
01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:34.070 align:start position:0%
so you have got to think of something
else

01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
so it there came uh two more programs
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
which are both in place now paper
 
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
there are different bases for these two
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
new programs there's the legal trans it
 
01:30:54.530 --> 01:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
isn't a matter of like oil on this on
 
01:30:56.810 --> 01:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
site okay they're they're more
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
complicated but you know I think that
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
some of these places are
 
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
are really good at providing complex
 
01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
situations for lawyers to argue about so
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
I don't mind I mean I'm not a lawyer and
 
01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
my my beloved Aunt may she rest in peace
 
01:31:17.570 --> 01:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
was a lawyer so I'm not anti-lawyers but
 
01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
every now and again I think is all this
 
01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.590 align:start position:0%
every now and again I think is all this
necessary

01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
anyhow there's a the new programs the
 
01:31:27.290 --> 01:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
capacity markets is
 
01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:28.430 align:start position:0%
capacity markets is
um

01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh a pay for performance and that is
 
01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
that um if you uh are called on in when
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
the grid is stressed to put your plant
 
01:31:43.850 --> 01:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
online and you don't do it then you have
 
01:31:47.209 --> 01:31:47.219 align:start position:0%
to pay some of your capacity payment to
 
01:31:49.129 --> 01:31:49.139 align:start position:0%
a plant that did it
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
the plant who came online gets extra
 
01:31:54.169 --> 01:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
money and you get fined and so that's
 
01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
how uh and I did not get into the
 
01:31:59.629 --> 01:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
capacity auctions okay this is supposed
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
to be half an hour and I don't want you
 
01:32:03.290 --> 01:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
to go home saying well that was
 
01:32:05.689 --> 01:32:05.699 align:start position:0%
something okay I want you to understand
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying mostly at least
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
so anyway the the um then so that's the
 
01:32:15.709 --> 01:32:15.719 align:start position:0%
legal construct of if you don't come
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
online you have to pay money to a plant
 
01:32:20.570 --> 01:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
that did come online
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
and then there's some inventory and
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
energy program which is sort of The
 
01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
Rebirth of the um
 
01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:31.070 align:start position:0%
Rebirth of the um
uh

01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:33.229 --> 01:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
The Rebirth of the rental reliability
 
01:32:33.239 --> 01:32:34.270 align:start position:0%
The Rebirth of the rental reliability
program

01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
and it is pays per day
 
01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
for fuel on site and of course there are
 
01:32:43.250 --> 01:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
rules about oh how much it pays and what
 
01:32:46.010 --> 01:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
fuel on site means and stuff but it it
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
it it is basically it isn't just a legal
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
construct it's it's about actual fuel
 
01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
that you can use oddly only certain
 
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
types of fuel are eligible uh not
 
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
nuclear not coal and as a matter of fact
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
I've been I've been reading a bunch of
 
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
stuff recently about
 
01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:05.629 align:start position:0%
stuff recently about
um

01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:05.639 --> 01:33:08.090 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:33:08.090 --> 01:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh ferc is is an ISO New England are are
 
01:33:13.490 --> 01:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
fighting about a little bit about
 
01:33:17.090 --> 01:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
whether Water behind the dam qualifies
 
01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
or not apparently it doesn't and but
 
01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
water in a pump storage facility
 
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
qualifies this is the kind of thing I
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
mean by uh you know there's a lot of fun
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
for people in these projects also I
 
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
would like to say that uh the program is
 
01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
is not really about results in my
 
01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
opinion and LNG seems pretty key in this
 
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
program but I I invite you to to look
 
01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
into the uh inventoried energy program
 
01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:48.590 align:start position:0%
into the uh inventoried energy program
yourself

01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
um I also want to say that it's very
 
01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
important a fast response is important
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
the fastest are hydro plants and
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
batteries and the next fast is a simple
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
uh gas turbines however uh keeping them
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
ready for Fast Response takes fuel
 
01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:08.219 align:start position:0%
simple gas turbines we used to call it
 
01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
hot standby but that's not that's not
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
considered a a modern term anymore I
 
01:34:14.450 --> 01:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
don't know what they call it but
 
01:34:17.209 --> 01:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
basically you can't start even a gas
 
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
turbine from Total scratch and to keep
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
it going to the point you can start it
 
01:34:24.649 --> 01:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
takes fuel steam plants and combine
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
cyclical gas plants are are slower
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to look forward a little
 
01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.149 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to look forward a little
here

01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
and I want to well I'm going to look
 
01:34:38.649 --> 01:34:38.659 align:start position:0%
forward a little and I'm going to uh
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about the could grid
 
01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
though I don't like to because I it's
 
01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
just hard enough to keep track of what
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
ferc is doing about water behind what
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
kind of dam without getting involved in
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
assessing different technologies that
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
might happen
 
01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
but here we go
 
01:35:00.410 --> 01:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
um the local code grid is very heavily
 
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
dependent on wind we are hoping for
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
offshore wind and and and that's what's
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
happening however in recent months
 
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
offshore wind developers have been
 
01:35:15.110 --> 01:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
either pulling out or calling for very
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
high price increases for uh this is from
 
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
utility dive you can you can look it up
 
01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:22.129 align:start position:0%
utility dive you can you can look it up
yourself

01:35:22.129 --> 01:35:22.139 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
01:35:22.139 --> 01:35:23.090 align:start position:0%
yourself
um

01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
and uh it it is 48 uh
 
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
for contract prices uh and and uh solar
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
prices to go up 63 percent and these are
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
mostly from New York information okay
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
um because that was the information I
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
was able to get uh
 
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
and uh I want you to know that if you
 
01:35:51.649 --> 01:35:51.659 align:start position:0%
look at uh you look at 167 per megawatt
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
hour or even 102 dollars per megawatt
 
01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
hour our grid usually runs 20 to 80
 
01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
dollars per megawatt hour
 
01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
okay so these are very high prices now
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes our grid runs a lot higher
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
than that I don't want to kid you and
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
real crunches it can run a lot higher uh
 
01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
recently last Christmas it was a two
 
01:36:17.890 --> 01:36:17.900 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per megawatt hour but
 
01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
nevertheless for uh for ongoing work not
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know here we're in a crisis
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
um a hundred and two to 167 is is a lot
 
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
of money luckily you won't pay that
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
money per se because it'll be mixed in
 
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
with inexpensive money from other uh
 
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
um other operators unless of course
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
it ends up setting the clearing price
 
01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that I don't know if it
 
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.370 --> 01:36:54.380 align:start position:0%
okay then this is a local code grid
 
01:36:57.410 --> 01:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
batteries now uh I I don't have a lot of
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
cost information for Batteries actually
 
01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
I don't think I have any but the thing
 
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
is that the biggest Landing battery in
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
the world at this point according to
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
um uh energy storage news uh is the
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
battery at Moss Landing and it has 750
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
megawatts of storage and four hours that
 
01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
it can discharge
 
01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:22.370 align:start position:0%
it can discharge
um

01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
this is not backing up the grid the Grid
 
01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
at base load is 10 000 megawatts okay
 
01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say that Vermont
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
Yankee which was 620 megawatts and could
 
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
run for 18 months without refueling was
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
considered to be too small to be cost
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
effective Meanwhile we're looking at
 
01:37:47.810 --> 01:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
these batteries that can run for four
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
hours now they're good for many things
 
01:37:52.930 --> 01:37:52.940 align:start position:0%
you know if there's a some kind of
 
01:37:55.850 --> 01:37:55.860 align:start position:0%
terrible problem with one plant they
 
01:37:59.209 --> 01:37:59.219 align:start position:0%
could really save the day but
 
01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
people have a tendency to look at them
 
01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:07.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
so here's another so far I've been
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
trying to stick to just the facts let me
 
01:38:16.610 --> 01:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
just say that I I have opinions and I
 
01:38:19.729 --> 01:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
think the nuclear could be a really good
 
01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
base load remember base load 60 70
 
01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
percent of energy we get nuclear as our
 
01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
base load we're going to have very low
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
CO2 emissions
 
01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:31.860 align:start position:0%
okay because we're only going to have 40
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
to 4 30 to 40 percent to play with with
 
01:38:37.129 --> 01:38:37.139 align:start position:0%
with fossil plans
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh nuclear can be sized to the grid now
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
what do I mean by that uh okay nuclear
 
01:38:46.729 --> 01:38:46.739 align:start position:0%
stores fuel on site you already got that
 
01:38:46.739 --> 01:38:48.350 align:start position:0%
stores fuel on site you already got that
part

01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:49.310 align:start position:0%
part
um

01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
in the old days the when grids were
 
01:38:56.169 --> 01:38:56.179 align:start position:0%
designed okay when and and
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
designed to be reliable the rule of
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
thumb was that whatever your Peak demand
 
01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
was you kept a hundred and twenty
 
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
percent of power plants available to
 
01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
meet that demand 120 percent of that
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
demand in power plants that you had
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
available okay that meant that if your
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
Peak demand was wrong or a power plant
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
or two went offline you could still do
 
01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:21.410 align:start position:0%
or two went offline you could still do
it

01:39:21.410 --> 01:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:22.729 align:start position:0%
it
now

01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:22.739 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
in those days
 
01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.689 align:start position:0%
in those days
nuclear

01:39:26.689 --> 01:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
nuclear
 
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
or any plant
 
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh was no more than 10 percent of the
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
grid it was not supposed to be 10 of the
 
01:39:35.689 --> 01:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
Grid or more than 10 percent of the grid
 
01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
so you have the giant Palo Verde plant
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
nuclear plant out in Arizona oddly
 
01:39:46.370 --> 01:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
enough it supplies Phoenix and uh nla it
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
isn't more than 10 percent of the grid
 
01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
you look at those cities
 
01:39:55.370 --> 01:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
solar acts like a mega plant it may be
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
all dispersed it's distributed it's
 
01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
wonderful but when you get right down
 
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
from the Sun goes down it all goes away
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
and similarly if you remember the
 
01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
picture I showed you of uh the fun and
 
01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
games on the Texas grid there are 40
 
01:40:16.139 --> 01:40:17.270 align:start position:0%
games on the Texas grid there are 40
percent

01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
um 40 solar I mean 40 megawatts is what
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
20 what I can't remember it now but what
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to say is the equivalent of
 
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
our entire grid went away when the wind
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
died down in Texas it was 20 megawatts
 
01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
20 gigawatts
 
01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:35.810 align:start position:0%
20 gigawatts
ah

01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
ah
 
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
but anyway
 
01:40:45.229 --> 01:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
um but you see the thing is that to some
 
01:40:45.239 --> 01:40:46.370 align:start position:0%
um but you see the thing is that to some
extent

01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
extent
 
01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
the Renewables are like uh giant plants
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's it always uh it's sunny or
 
01:40:56.090 --> 01:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
it isn't
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.209 --> 01:41:05.219 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say that nuclear can
 
01:41:07.010 --> 01:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
follow a load
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
and if you we were willing right now
 
01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
we're running on over 50 natural gas in
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
New England that's what we have so
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
anybody who's concerned about well how
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
are we going to get the last 10 percent
 
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
I say hey how about the first 50 you
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
know so if we had nuclear base loaded 60
 
01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
we would we would not have to have
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
nearly as much fossil and and you say
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
well you might still have to have some
 
01:41:36.189 --> 01:41:36.199 align:start position:0%
fossil I'm like okay I agree
 
01:41:39.530 --> 01:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
but uh I don't I mean I'm just sort of
 
01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
like whatever
 
01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
so I just want to say uh another thing
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
again editorializing
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
the conventional statements are often
 
01:41:51.530 --> 01:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
about how an individual citizen is
 
01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
supposed to act
 
01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
make personal sacrifices don't eat meat
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
don't keep your house too warm
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh don't uh lawnmowers why don't you
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
have a wild lawn plastic straws it's all
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
up to me and and it's like I'm gonna do
 
01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:09.179 align:start position:0%
this I'm going to change my way of
 
01:42:10.729 --> 01:42:10.739 align:start position:0%
living and everything's going to be
 
01:42:10.739 --> 01:42:11.810 align:start position:0%
living and everything's going to be
great

01:42:11.810 --> 01:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
but I want to say that and and you all
 
01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
know this because you're all
 
01:42:20.290 --> 01:42:20.300 align:start position:0%
Representatives you are all here making
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
regulations laws rules
 
01:42:26.689 --> 01:42:26.699 align:start position:0%
a citizen is a citizen not a loan actor
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
a good citizen acts as a citizen and
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
realizes the death toll if anything
 
01:42:35.689 --> 01:42:35.699 align:start position:0%
happens to the grid there are 200 to 700
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
people who died in Texas just from a
 
01:42:41.930 --> 01:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
48-hour outage if you read and I don't
 
01:42:43.629 --> 01:42:43.639 align:start position:0%
recommend you to read it before bedtime
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
Ted koppel's old book life's out about
 
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
what would happen if the American grid
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
went down but don't read it before
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
bedtime I'm telling you it's a scary
 
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.070 align:start position:0%
bedtime I'm telling you it's a scary
book

01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
book
 
01:43:00.649 --> 01:43:00.659 align:start position:0%
so let's have uh we I want to
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
see us making choices
 
01:43:08.810 --> 01:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
that will lead to a stable reliable Grid
 
01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
it's not about sacrifices it's about
 
01:43:14.590 --> 01:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
choices it can be also about sacrifices
 
01:43:17.450 --> 01:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
it may be that we should keep our houses
 
01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
cooler but that isn't it I mean
 
01:43:22.129 --> 01:43:22.139 align:start position:0%
everybody in Germany that's right now
 
01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
using a lot of lignite okay lots of
 
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
lignite coal they could all keep their
 
01:43:30.169 --> 01:43:30.179 align:start position:0%
houses cooler and they still wouldn't
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.530 --> 01:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
so anyway this is about my book and uh I
 
01:43:41.209 --> 01:43:41.219 align:start position:0%
didn't read copies but I guess there's a
 
01:43:44.990 --> 01:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
copy floating around and uh I would like
 
01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
you to I'm happy to hear from you and
 
01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:50.300 align:start position:0%
you can write me at
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
Meredith Anglin at gmail just all squish
 
01:43:56.570 --> 01:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
together one word on the formerly known
 
01:43:59.570 --> 01:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
as Twitter I'm at Meredith anguin and
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
there's a uh there's a very nice thing
 
01:44:04.850 --> 01:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
called uh electricitymaps.com you gotta
 
01:44:07.129 --> 01:44:07.139 align:start position:0%
fuss around a little bit with it but
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's a it's very good to show you which
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
grids are actually producing a lot of
 
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
CO2 and that's it well thank you that
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm gonna put you on the spot
 
01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit and ask you if you can help
 
01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
us resolve a question that we debate on
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
this committee quite frequently
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
transmission costs you write in your
 
01:44:39.050 --> 01:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
book the building of distributed
 
01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
Generations smaller power plants such as
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
solar arrays increases the cost of
 
01:44:44.159 --> 01:44:45.410 align:start position:0%
solar arrays increases the cost of
transmission

01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
renewable Advocates will disagree with
 
01:44:49.010 --> 01:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
this statement
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
indeed if Renewables were always
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
available to be dispatched to the grid
 
01:44:56.450 --> 01:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
this statement would be false however
 
01:44:58.729 --> 01:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
since most Renewables are available only
 
01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
part of the time they must be backed up
 
01:45:03.709 --> 01:45:03.719 align:start position:0%
with other forms of power therefore
 
01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:07.860 align:start position:0%
transmission costs do increase and you
 
01:45:12.290 --> 01:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
emphasize the word do in your text
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
now this committee debates this question
 
01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:17.030 align:start position:0%
now this committee debates this question
frequently

01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
if a renewable system is on the grid
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
then the people who consume the
 
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
electricity near that system avoid
 
01:45:28.729 --> 01:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
transmission costs yes theoretically
 
01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
so the question always becomes
 
01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
do Renewables increase or decrease
 
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
transmission costs you've asserted that
 
01:45:39.770 --> 01:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
they increase them could you give us
 
01:45:42.649 --> 01:45:42.659 align:start position:0%
some insight as to your reasoning and
 
01:45:45.530 --> 01:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
try to help us resolve this question
 
01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
well yes first of all you have the
 
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
Renewables are um
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
are often built where people don't live
 
01:45:58.669 --> 01:45:58.679 align:start position:0%
now I am I'm a fan of a relative fan of
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
rooftop solar uh what because a solar
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
the thing about solar is it's available
 
01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
when people need power wind it's when
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
it's available and it isn't got anything
 
01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
to do with the people in Nepal
 
01:46:13.609 --> 01:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
so what I'm saying is that a wind
 
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
turbines are built
 
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
where it's windy
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
and people aren't living there
 
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
so for example let's say I I say to you
 
01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:26.629 align:start position:0%
so for example let's say I I say to you
uh

01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
there's a a nuclear plant here and we're
 
01:46:31.729 --> 01:46:31.739 align:start position:0%
shutting it down and we're going to
 
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
replace it with
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
no there's a coal plant here and we're
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
shutting it down we're going to replace
 
01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
it with
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
well if you replaced it with a nuclear
 
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
plant you could use the same footprint
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
you could use the same transmission
 
01:46:47.709 --> 01:46:47.719 align:start position:0%
lines you could use the same
 
01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
substations you you you don't have extra
 
01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
cost except the usual costs of upgrading
 
01:46:56.689 --> 01:46:56.699 align:start position:0%
systems that you have to do all the time
 
01:46:59.689 --> 01:46:59.699 align:start position:0%
anyway okay I mean it you don't have to
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
build anything new you don't have to you
 
01:47:06.010 --> 01:47:06.020 align:start position:0%
don't have to send people out to do uh
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
Scouting For who's going to be least
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
offended if we put a transmission line
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
here and so forth okay
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
but if you decide that you're going to
 
01:47:21.229 --> 01:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
replace it with uh wind backed up by
 
01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
well the natural gas might be in place
 
01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
where you already have transmission
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
lines it might it might not I don't know
 
01:47:32.810 --> 01:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
I can't say that
 
01:47:36.050 --> 01:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
but the wind isn't going to be
 
01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
the wind is going to be on a ridge or
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
out to sea or whatever and you're going
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
to have to have transmission lines and
 
01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
substations that are
 
01:47:49.609 --> 01:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
um I you know one of the problems with
 
01:47:54.590 --> 01:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
talking about the grid
 
01:47:57.770 --> 01:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
is that I want to be authoritative on
 
01:47:59.810 --> 01:47:59.820 align:start position:0%
every subject and I'm moderately
 
01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
authoritative on many subjects but for
 
01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
example I'm giving a course at osher
 
01:48:08.810 --> 01:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
and and the OSHA course I have invited
 
01:48:12.290 --> 01:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
Lee cordner whose business is helping
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
people build transmission lines and he's
 
01:48:16.850 --> 01:48:16.860 align:start position:0%
going to be a guest speaker I wish I
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
could kind of pull him over here and and
 
01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:22.139 align:start position:0%
and and and and have him here I can't I
 
01:48:26.410 --> 01:48:26.420 align:start position:0%
for one think he lives in in uh in um uh
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
in California and he's going to be on
 
01:48:32.810 --> 01:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
zoom and for other other things he's
 
01:48:35.209 --> 01:48:35.219 align:start position:0%
actually kind of shy about having things
 
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
recorded and so forth because he's
 
01:48:41.050 --> 01:48:41.060 align:start position:0%
involved in so many actual issues but
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
basically that is one of the things and
 
01:48:45.470 --> 01:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
then once you get those transmission
 
01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
lines to the wind turbines they're only
 
01:48:51.770 --> 01:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
available 30 percent of the time so
 
01:48:53.689 --> 01:48:53.699 align:start position:0%
usually if you build a lot of
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
transmission lines like the ones that
 
01:48:58.850 --> 01:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
were streaming out from uh Seabrook all
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
the ones leading out from Seabrook you
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
expect to have a power on the large part
 
01:49:07.609 --> 01:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
of the timer isn't worth investing so
 
01:49:10.850 --> 01:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
you end up with a lot of expense
 
01:49:12.649 --> 01:49:12.659 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you representative
 
01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman for and thank
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:49:21.790 --> 01:49:21.800 align:start position:0%
um so you mentioned three types of grids
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
and but you haven't I have not had the
 
01:49:28.609 --> 01:49:28.619 align:start position:0%
opportunity to treat your book you did
 
01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
not mention grid modernization and how
 
01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
does that how would you say that fits
 
01:49:38.090 --> 01:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
into uh the trend of wanting to put more
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
Renewables out there but people do
 
01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
realize that we have to have grid
 
01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
modernization how does that affect
 
01:49:48.770 --> 01:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
um that and I like to add first I forgot
 
01:49:51.250 --> 01:49:51.260 align:start position:0%
to say thank you very much for a most
 
01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
pragmatic presentation which I really
 
01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
enjoy so thank you for that and that now
 
01:49:58.490 --> 01:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
my question okay
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
so the question is about grid
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
modernization unfortunately grid
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
modernization covers a lot of ground
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
some of which I think is lovely and some
 
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
of which I think is terrible so uh or at
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
least not too good
 
01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
I hate to say terrible so some of the
 
01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:16.010 align:start position:0%
I hate to say terrible so some of the
good

01:50:16.010 --> 01:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
good things about grid modernization is
 
01:50:22.729 --> 01:50:22.739 align:start position:0%
that you with with uh with a modern grid
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
grid operator doesn't have to wait for
 
01:50:33.649 --> 01:50:33.659 align:start position:0%
the phone calls to come in to say oh my
 
01:50:36.050 --> 01:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
God I just lost power and a tree is down
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
about three blocks from here
 
01:50:41.570 --> 01:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
they know where the power failed because
 
01:50:44.930 --> 01:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
the the grid is now a little bit more uh
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
give some more information
 
01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
on the other hand a lot of grid
 
01:50:53.209 --> 01:50:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
well it's it's it's going to lead to
 
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
more expense for what I don't consider
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
a worth very worthwhile
 
01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:08.390 align:start position:0%
a worth very worthwhile
results

01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
results
 
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
so for example let's say we begin
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
charging our electric vehicles at night
 
01:51:16.129 --> 01:51:16.139 align:start position:0%
well I've been reading I didn't even
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
know this until a couple weeks ago but
 
01:51:20.810 --> 01:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
apparently our
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
our Transformers
 
01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
expect to cool down at night and if all
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
of a sudden they're not cooling down
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to shorten their life
 
01:51:32.810 --> 01:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
expectancy so are we happy because we
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
have just modernized a grid we've
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
replaced a bunch of Transformers with
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
bigger Transformers that maybe are big
 
01:51:40.970 --> 01:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
enough so that even if people are
 
01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
charging at night they're still cooling
 
01:51:45.290 --> 01:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
down I don't know but what I'm trying to
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
say is or another thing
 
01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:50.290 align:start position:0%
say is or another thing
um

01:51:50.290 --> 01:51:50.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:53.570 --> 01:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
I am not
 
01:51:58.490 --> 01:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
a fan I I mean I think it's fine
 
01:52:03.709 --> 01:52:03.719 align:start position:0%
for a big company to decide that it's
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to participate in a demand
 
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
response program because it's worth it
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
to that uh company to have lower
 
01:52:14.689 --> 01:52:14.699 align:start position:0%
electric rates because they're in the
 
01:52:18.590 --> 01:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
program even if every two years there or
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
ever whatever their their turn they have
 
01:52:24.109 --> 01:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
to turn off their electricity that's the
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
company's decision whether they're going
 
01:52:27.890 --> 01:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
to make them that or not
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
I feel that the modern grid is forcing
 
01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
us all into demand response programs I
 
01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
mean I have a friend in California
 
01:52:41.209 --> 01:52:41.219 align:start position:0%
who wrote me and she said you know I'm a
 
01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
working single mother Meredith and I
 
01:52:46.850 --> 01:52:46.860 align:start position:0%
come home and I turn on uh the stove and
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
I cook dinner for my kids don't judge me
 
01:52:51.410 --> 01:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
I said who am I to judge you but what
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to say is that she's not
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to do that it's a flex alert
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
time the flex alert lasts from four
 
01:52:59.450 --> 01:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
o'clock to nine o'clock and you're
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to minimize the amount of
 
01:53:02.810 --> 01:53:02.820 align:start position:0%
electricity you use
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what good modernization
 
01:53:05.639 --> 01:53:09.169 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what good modernization
means

01:53:09.169 --> 01:53:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
01:53:13.609 --> 01:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
being here really appreciated your
 
01:53:15.239 --> 01:53:16.850 align:start position:0%
being here really appreciated your
presentation

01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:16.860 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:53:18.649 --> 01:53:18.659 align:start position:0%
um my question is around capacity
 
01:53:21.050 --> 01:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
planning because when I first started
 
01:53:22.850 --> 01:53:22.860 align:start position:0%
paying attention to the iso New England
 
01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
and the planning that's being done it
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
seems like our energy systems are
 
01:53:29.330 --> 01:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
extremely siled and so the
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility for reliability may be
 
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
the ballywick of the iso but the idea
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
around what we put on or take off the
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
grid in terms of reliability we've had a
 
01:53:42.609 --> 01:53:42.619 align:start position:0%
lot of nuclear plants that have closed
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
rather than upgrading them to new
 
01:53:47.629 --> 01:53:47.639 align:start position:0%
technology that could load follow you
 
01:53:49.010 --> 01:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
know it doesn't seem like there's any
 
01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
planning in terms of the actual problems
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be facing in the
 
01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:53.629 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be facing in the
future

01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
and so the question really is around
 
01:53:58.430 --> 01:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
where the responsibility lies for that
 
01:54:00.590 --> 01:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
capacity planning in terms of like you
 
01:54:02.810 --> 01:54:02.820 align:start position:0%
said the decisions that get made because
 
01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
that's the reason I'm here is that I I
 
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
thought that the the most important
 
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
decisions the state would be making
 
01:54:10.370 --> 01:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
would be around
 
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know what what we would be doing
 
01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
with the grid for the future and how it
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
would be very expensive for people if we
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
make the wrong decisions right if we run
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
down the wrong roads we're going to
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time and a lot of money
 
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh undoing those those runs in the wrong
 
01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:29.930 align:start position:0%
uh undoing those those runs in the wrong
direction

01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
well I agree with you and I've often
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
said that the trouble with the RTO
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
system is the buck stops nowhere uh if
 
01:54:41.570 --> 01:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh and and it has a a market independent
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
Market monitor who's supposed to uh look
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
and see if for example some some
 
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
company owns three power plants on the
 
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
grid and it sees that the grid is having
 
01:54:57.169 --> 01:54:57.179 align:start position:0%
a problem and it takes one of its power
 
01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
plants off because now the the grid
 
01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
operator is going to have to call in
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
very expensive power plants and now it's
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
going to make more money it's not going
 
01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
to have to supply fuel for its cheapest
 
01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
power plant and it's going to make more
 
01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
money so this and and then
 
01:55:18.169 --> 01:55:18.179 align:start position:0%
so the the grid uh independent Market
 
01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:19.860 align:start position:0%
monitor is supposed to be on the lookout
 
01:55:21.890 --> 01:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
for this but I tell you I don't think
 
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
that they can watch it all I mean and
 
01:55:27.709 --> 01:55:27.719 align:start position:0%
what I mean by that is that uh I read a
 
01:55:29.570 --> 01:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
really good book not on the same subject
 
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
it's Javier Blas is uh the world for
 
01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
sale about Traders and I can tell you
 
01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
that no matter what the monitors say the
 
01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
Traders will get their trades done and
 
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
similarly if there's a company that
 
01:55:45.649 --> 01:55:45.659 align:start position:0%
wants uh to get the uh the clearing
 
01:55:48.169 --> 01:55:48.179 align:start position:0%
price higher and it can do it it will
 
01:55:49.970 --> 01:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
manage to do it I mean I don't mean to
 
01:55:53.770 --> 01:55:53.780 align:start position:0%
be terribly cynical but anyway
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
that's how I look at the world I guess
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's me I'm cynical
 
01:56:01.729 --> 01:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
um but yes the buck doesn't stop
 
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere one other thing about the buck
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
not stopping if you go to ISO New
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
England and you say um
 
01:56:09.890 --> 01:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
where are the power plants that you
 
01:56:12.169 --> 01:56:12.179 align:start position:0%
should be building power the iso New
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
England will say resource adequacy is
 
01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
the state's business how many power
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
plants are built it's a state's business
 
01:56:23.330 --> 01:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
we just dispatched them I'm like huh
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
you you also set up the rules for who
 
01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
gets paid how much that's a little bit
 
01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
of a responsibility but anyway that is
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
something I wanted to say Okay I I I've
 
01:56:36.530 --> 01:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
talked too long yes representative munz
 
01:56:37.729 --> 01:56:37.739 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
01:56:39.890 --> 01:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for uh
 
01:56:41.810 --> 01:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
coming in I'd like to come back to the
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
conversation we were having we were
 
01:56:47.090 --> 01:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
having with you about transmission costs
 
01:56:51.169 --> 01:56:51.179 align:start position:0%
um and I I will I will accept you know
 
01:56:55.070 --> 01:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
your premise that if you were to replace
 
01:56:57.169 --> 01:56:57.179 align:start position:0%
a coal-fired plant with a nuclear plant
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to build new
 
01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
transmission lines I completely agree
 
01:57:02.930 --> 01:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
with you there
 
01:57:05.689 --> 01:57:05.699 align:start position:0%
um and and I would also agree that if
 
01:57:05.699 --> 01:57:06.890 align:start position:0%
um and and I would also agree that if
you

01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
um install wind turbines offshore you're
 
01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
going to have to build new transmission
 
01:57:12.410 --> 01:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
lines so there's going to be a
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
transmission cost increase but isn't
 
01:57:18.290 --> 01:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
that only half the equation because the
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
cost of actually produce a building the
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
wind turbines
 
01:57:24.770 --> 01:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
is going to be significantly less than
 
01:57:28.250 --> 01:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
the cost of building a nuclear plant no
 
01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:29.990 align:start position:0%
the cost of building a nuclear plant no
um

01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:32.330 --> 01:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
um and and the ongoing operating costs
 
01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
for example or a solar farm
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
um I mean you know yes I mean maybe the
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
transmission costs go up but don't we
 
01:57:43.609 --> 01:57:43.619 align:start position:0%
have to look at the total costs actually
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
we've been there's been a lot of work on
 
01:57:47.689 --> 01:57:47.699 align:start position:0%
that and I don't follow it as close as I
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
should but basically what happened is
 
01:57:53.209 --> 01:57:53.219 align:start position:0%
back in the day uh Lazar Brothers used
 
01:57:56.209 --> 01:57:56.219 align:start position:0%
to write a thing called the levelized
 
01:57:58.729 --> 01:57:58.739 align:start position:0%
cost of transmission for different uh
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
different types of power plants and and
 
01:58:07.010 --> 01:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
and and and and and it was always coming
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
out with you know oh solar uh wind is
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
great well people began saying hey we
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
put wind on a grid and and uh almost
 
01:58:20.089 --> 01:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
always the uh the cost of to the
 
01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
consumer goes up and so Lazar has
 
01:58:25.129 --> 01:58:25.139 align:start position:0%
recently gone back and and then other
 
01:58:27.770 --> 01:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
people were doing calculations on what
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
they call system costs that is you put
 
01:58:32.570 --> 01:58:32.580 align:start position:0%
the wind on the grid and then uh you
 
01:58:35.330 --> 01:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
have to make sure there's uh gas plants
 
01:58:38.270 --> 01:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
on the grid and also when a nuclear
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
plant runs for 40 40 uh years no problem
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
60 years no problem I don't know if it's
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to run 80 years but what I'm
 
01:58:48.890 --> 01:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
trying to say is your average wind
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
turbine is restructured after 10 years
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
now the reason for that is a little more
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
complicated this is the whole policy
 
01:58:59.810 --> 01:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
thing but basically wind turbines get
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
what's called a uh production tax credit
 
01:59:05.330 --> 01:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
which runs out after 10 years but they
 
01:59:07.790 --> 01:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
can reset the clock by doing a major
 
01:59:10.970 --> 01:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
overhaul so I don't really know whether
 
01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
they could last 20 years if if they if
 
01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
the product production tax credit lasted
 
01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
20 years it's the policy and the
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
physical are very confusing but I would
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
say that a wind turbine is is out there
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
in the wind in the atmosphere it's a
 
01:59:29.689 --> 01:59:29.699 align:start position:0%
delicate piece of equipment and it
 
01:59:33.050 --> 01:59:33.060 align:start position:0%
really isn't going to last for 60 years
 
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
and so you have to look at that a
 
01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
follow-up and I always use I was only
 
01:59:40.250 --> 01:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
using wind as an example of of a
 
01:59:43.250 --> 01:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
renewable uh fuel I mean
 
01:59:46.250 --> 01:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
um you know solars and other Renewable
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
Fuel my point is that
 
01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:50.629 align:start position:0%
Fuel my point is that
um

01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:52.970 --> 01:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
to argue that
 
01:59:55.550 --> 01:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
that renew that Renewables are going to
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
drive up the cost of transmission
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
therefore they are not worth investing
 
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
in doesn't seem to hold water
 
02:00:06.649 --> 02:00:06.659 align:start position:0%
because there are because the the the
 
02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:09.560 align:start position:0%
the the the the the the the the the
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
capital cost and perhaps and and
 
02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:13.860 align:start position:0%
certainly the operating costs of some of
 
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:15.719 align:start position:0%
these renewable projects is going to be
 
02:00:17.930 --> 02:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
a lot less
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
the capital cost if you look at running
 
02:00:23.209 --> 02:00:23.219 align:start position:0%
a a renewable project for 40 years and
 
02:00:25.729 --> 02:00:25.739 align:start position:0%
replacing it after 10 to 20 years is not
 
02:00:28.850 --> 02:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
as per megawatt hour it's not not as low
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
as you might think okay and and I I
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
encourage you to look at lassit brothers
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
and a Tom Stacy who does a lot of work
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
on that uh and um
 
02:00:42.410 --> 02:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
I didn't say they weren't worth building
 
02:00:45.770 --> 02:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
I mean I think that I I personally think
 
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
that a nuclear base load plus uh uh
 
02:00:52.970 --> 02:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
solar and natural gas following would be
 
02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
a lovely lovely uh low low carbon uh
 
02:00:59.870 --> 02:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
low-cost grid but I'm going to tell you
 
02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
right now that I am remember the first
 
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
slide reliability is first reliability
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
is first I'm sorry I should I should I
 
02:01:11.450 --> 02:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
wish I had some kind of deep voice and
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
something bang on but but basically
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
reliability is first and and and wind
 
02:01:20.570 --> 02:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
turbines may have zero fuel costs but
 
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
that you can't count on them when the
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
going gets tough
 
02:01:27.470 --> 02:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative Harrington gets the
 
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
last question and then we have to wrap
 
02:01:30.770 --> 02:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
up uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:01:31.850 --> 02:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
for taking my question it was very
 
02:01:34.129 --> 02:01:34.139 align:start position:0%
informative presentation try to get a
 
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
little bit out of the theoretical and
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit more into the
 
02:01:38.570 --> 02:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
Practical I don't know how versed you
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
are in this but if you do have an
 
02:01:41.930 --> 02:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
opinion I'd like to hear it the the two
 
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
Mystic power plants are going to be
 
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
closing next June they're basically the
 
02:01:47.930 --> 02:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
RMR plans right now that won't be
 
02:01:49.609 --> 02:01:49.619 align:start position:0%
extended they've already announced that
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to close down that's 1400
 
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
megawatts of power we're going to lose
 
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
but because they take about 60 percent
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
of the offload from the Everett LNG
 
02:02:01.609 --> 02:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
facility it looks like the Everett LNG
 
02:02:04.370 --> 02:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
facility is also going to close now I
 
02:02:07.490 --> 02:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
was recently at a ferc ISO New England
 
02:02:09.169 --> 02:02:09.179 align:start position:0%
winter assessment meeting and looking
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
forward and about half the people there
 
02:02:13.250 --> 02:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
said we've got to do something to keep
 
02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
the Everett LNG facility going because
 
02:02:17.689 --> 02:02:17.699 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough natural gas in the
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
winter and we also need it for back
 
02:02:21.470 --> 02:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
pressure on the natural gas pipelines
 
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
and the other half said no we can
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
probably get away without it do you have
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
an opinion when way the other on that I
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
wish we were keeping them yes I mean I
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry but but there's a lot of
 
02:02:33.229 --> 02:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
wishful thinking about we can probably
 
02:02:37.209 --> 02:02:37.219 align:start position:0%
get away you understand that a a a a a
 
02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
systems engineer shouldn't be saying
 
02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:41.830 align:start position:0%
systems engineer shouldn't be saying
that

02:02:41.830 --> 02:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
I mean that's not the the the best way
 
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
now I understand that people really
 
02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
really don't like them and and and as a
 
02:02:55.850 --> 02:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
matter of fact uh uh I I think it's uh
 
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's sort of shameful that we have to
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
get LNG cargos from Tobago to run our
 
02:03:02.639 --> 02:03:03.589 align:start position:0%
get LNG cargos from Tobago to run our
grid

02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
grid
 
02:03:06.290 --> 02:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
I mean I think that's a shame and I
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
think somebody should go over to New
 
02:03:11.089 --> 02:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
York and shake them until they let us
 
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
build a pipeline to the Marcellus
 
02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
but uh I I just want to say that I I was
 
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
I watched that meeting also I I have to
 
02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
tell you that I don't travel as much as
 
02:03:26.689 --> 02:03:26.699 align:start position:0%
I'd I'd like to so I watch a lot of
 
02:03:28.609 --> 02:03:28.619 align:start position:0%
meetings on on Zoom
 
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
and that's the way it is I just tell
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
people in the wintertime especially when
 
02:03:34.010 --> 02:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
you go home at night pray that there's
 
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
no industrial accidents in Tobago
 
02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
because if there is we're out of luck
 
02:03:44.030 --> 02:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:46.010 --> 02:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
for a big
 
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
Rich industrial country to be dependent
 
02:03:51.709 --> 02:03:51.719 align:start position:0%
this way
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
I agree and thank you very much for your
 
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
presentation here today it's really been
 
02:03:58.910 --> 02:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
a treat to have you here and we're
 
02:04:01.129 --> 02:04:01.139 align:start position:0%
really grateful that you came and we
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
hope to see you again sometime thank you
 
02:04:04.609 --> 02:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:11.450 --> 02:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
we are officially on lunch break now
 
02:04:13.609 --> 02:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
until one o'clock at which time we will
 
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
take up our retained bills so we'll see
 
03:06:22.010 --> 03:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:23.809 --> 03:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
okay everybody please take your seat
 
03:07:21.849 --> 03:07:21.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:25.670 --> 03:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:28.210 --> 03:07:28.220 align:start position:0%
yeah my car's outside it's smashed
 
03:07:30.349 --> 03:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
well you got whiplash on we're getting
 
03:07:32.570 --> 03:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
your ended all right everybody let's get
 
03:07:32.580 --> 03:07:34.130 align:start position:0%
your ended all right everybody let's get
started

03:07:34.130 --> 03:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
started
 
03:07:37.550 --> 03:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
this is the one o'clock session of
 
03:07:39.469 --> 03:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy we are
 
03:07:40.610 --> 03:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
going to have a full committee work
 
03:07:43.370 --> 03:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
session on our retained bills
 
03:07:45.530 --> 03:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
and here's what we're going to do we're
 
03:07:47.330 --> 03:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
going to go through each bill
 
03:07:49.130 --> 03:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
one by one
 
03:07:51.830 --> 03:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
and we're going to decide whether or not
 
03:07:55.190 --> 03:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
we need to form a subcommittee
 
03:07:57.650 --> 03:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
if the answer is no then we move on to
 
03:07:58.969 --> 03:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
the next bill
 
03:08:02.150 --> 03:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
if the answer is yes then we form a
 
03:08:04.490 --> 03:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we ask for volunteers to
 
03:08:06.410 --> 03:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
serve on the subcommittee and I appoint
 
03:08:10.370 --> 03:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:12.290 --> 03:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
the chair of the subcommittee will then
 
03:08:14.929 --> 03:08:14.939 align:start position:0%
go to the subcommittee members and
 
03:08:19.070 --> 03:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
discuss potential future meeting dates
 
03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
once you decide on potential future
 
03:08:23.809 --> 03:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
meeting dates then the chair will go to
 
03:08:23.819 --> 03:08:24.830 align:start position:0%
meeting dates then the chair will go to
carry

03:08:24.830 --> 03:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
carry
 
03:08:29.030 --> 03:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
our admin and the staff office to
 
03:08:33.650 --> 03:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:35.630 --> 03:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
now the presence of members of a
 
03:08:37.730 --> 03:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is required at a
 
03:08:39.530 --> 03:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting
 
03:08:43.070 --> 03:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
but any stne member or in fact any
 
03:08:45.230 --> 03:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
member of the House can attend a
 
03:08:46.790 --> 03:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting
 
03:08:49.670 --> 03:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
according to House Rules
 
03:08:53.150 --> 03:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee will then deliberate
 
03:08:53.160 --> 03:08:54.830 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee will then deliberate
on

03:08:54.830 --> 03:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:08:57.469 --> 03:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
what should happen with the bill
 
03:08:59.870 --> 03:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
if it's decided by the subcommittee that
 
03:09:03.769 --> 03:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
a that an amendment is necessary or
 
03:09:06.170 --> 03:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
desirable for the bill the subcommittee
 
03:09:06.180 --> 03:09:07.070 align:start position:0%
desirable for the bill the subcommittee
will

03:09:07.070 --> 03:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:09:09.230 --> 03:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
create such an amendment
 
03:09:11.630 --> 03:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
and bring it to the full committee when
 
03:09:14.809 --> 03:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
we convene to pass judgment on all of
 
03:09:19.309 --> 03:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:22.190 --> 03:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
so that will be the procedure
 
03:09:24.349 --> 03:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we can get through these
 
03:09:27.110 --> 03:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
12 bills fairly promptly anybody have
 
03:09:28.570 --> 03:09:28.580 align:start position:0%
any questions about the procedure
 
03:09:31.670 --> 03:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative Gorman thank you I just
 
03:09:33.950 --> 03:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
want to verify are you planning that we
 
03:09:36.590 --> 03:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
would do an exec on all 12 bills on
 
03:09:38.510 --> 03:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
October 31st
 
03:09:38.520 --> 03:09:39.590 align:start position:0%
October 31st
not

03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:09:42.950 --> 03:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
October 31st but uh a day to be
 
03:09:46.309 --> 03:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
determined later and and we would exec
 
03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
all 12 together all 12 will be done on
 
03:09:51.469 --> 03:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
the same day yes
 
03:09:55.550 --> 03:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:58.730 --> 03:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:01.730 --> 03:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
okay let's get started first bill is
 
03:10:05.870 --> 03:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:09.429 --> 03:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
I suggest that since this bill is
 
03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional as written
 
03:10:14.870 --> 03:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
that we consider itl as the motion for
 
03:10:16.010 --> 03:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:10:18.050 --> 03:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
now I know some people
 
03:10:21.170 --> 03:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
would expect that we would want to try
 
03:10:23.870 --> 03:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
to do something about the spiking cost
 
03:10:25.070 --> 03:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
03:10:27.710 --> 03:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
and representative Bernardi has filed a
 
03:10:27.720 --> 03:10:28.429 align:start position:0%
and representative Bernardi has filed a
bill

03:10:28.429 --> 03:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:10:31.429 --> 03:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
for this uh or an LSR for this upcoming
 
03:10:31.439 --> 03:10:32.889 align:start position:0%
for this uh or an LSR for this upcoming
session

03:10:32.889 --> 03:10:32.899 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:10:37.130 --> 03:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
to allow laddering of
 
03:10:38.990 --> 03:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
default service procurement so
 
03:10:40.670 --> 03:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi could you
 
03:10:46.969 --> 03:10:46.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:50.510 --> 03:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
the LSR is not yet written uh completely
 
03:10:53.809 --> 03:10:53.819 align:start position:0%
it's in it's with OLS how however the
 
03:10:57.530 --> 03:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
concept that I gave them was uh right
 
03:11:01.250 --> 03:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
now we have contract requirements that
 
03:11:04.490 --> 03:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
go every six months and when the when
 
03:11:07.730 --> 03:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
the utilities go out looking to fill
 
03:11:10.030 --> 03:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
those contracts they're subject to
 
03:11:12.769 --> 03:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
largely the the costs that are available
 
03:11:17.030 --> 03:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the market in that unique time window
 
03:11:21.170 --> 03:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
um with the lattering concept they could
 
03:11:23.050 --> 03:11:23.060 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
03:11:25.990 --> 03:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
contracts that go anywhere from I I
 
03:11:32.330 --> 03:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
suggested three to nine month period and
 
03:11:36.290 --> 03:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
um and I asked OLS to look at other
 
03:11:39.230 --> 03:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
states how they're doing it and so we
 
03:11:42.769 --> 03:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
could use those as examples uh in in
 
03:11:45.769 --> 03:11:45.779 align:start position:0%
preparing that language so that's that's
 
03:11:52.030 --> 03:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:54.290 --> 03:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington in the past
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's was that was how the rates were
 
03:11:58.610 --> 03:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
set there used to be like Unitil or
 
03:12:00.110 --> 03:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
whatever would have a contract and it
 
03:12:01.910 --> 03:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
would have half of their load for a
 
03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
certain period another absolutely all
 
03:12:05.630 --> 03:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
the load would not come up due on the
 
03:12:07.490 --> 03:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
same date like they they are now so
 
03:12:09.290 --> 03:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
there is a precedent for doing this so
 
03:12:10.910 --> 03:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure if we look back we could figure
 
03:12:13.130 --> 03:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
out how it was done
 
03:12:18.050 --> 03:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:20.990 --> 03:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with averages so it all
 
03:12:22.429 --> 03:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
depends sometimes it's going to come out
 
03:12:24.830 --> 03:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
beneficial sometimes it isn't it's like
 
03:12:27.530 --> 03:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
if you looked at this past year when
 
03:12:29.450 --> 03:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
Maine does it on a yearly basis we do it
 
03:12:31.550 --> 03:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
on six months ours went up higher and
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
everyone oh my God the price is much
 
03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
lower in Maine but then when the prices
 
03:12:36.410 --> 03:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
went down and we were able to adjust
 
03:12:38.809 --> 03:12:38.819 align:start position:0%
quicker no one made a big deal out of
 
03:12:39.830 --> 03:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that the prices were going to
 
03:12:41.090 --> 03:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
be higher in Maine for the next six
 
03:12:44.990 --> 03:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
months so it's I mean it it minimizes
 
03:12:46.429 --> 03:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
the ups and downs but it probably
 
03:12:48.170 --> 03:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the total cost very much
 
03:12:50.450 --> 03:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
it just means you're paying you know x
 
03:12:52.190 --> 03:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars more closer to the
 
03:12:54.290 --> 03:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
same amount every month rather than have
 
03:12:55.370 --> 03:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
it go up
 
03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
120 percent of accident go down to 80 of
 
03:13:00.050 --> 03:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
X so I don't think it changes the totals
 
03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
that much but it does make it avoids
 
03:13:05.389 --> 03:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
those big bumps and bills
 
03:13:07.910 --> 03:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr yeah
 
03:13:09.410 --> 03:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
I want to uh reiterate with
 
03:13:11.150 --> 03:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington said I think
 
03:13:14.990 --> 03:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
the key is that the lattering can
 
03:13:17.690 --> 03:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
soften the blow shall we speak it it
 
03:13:19.730 --> 03:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
it's uh so that people have a more
 
03:13:21.710 --> 03:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
consistent monthly payment versus
 
03:13:23.469 --> 03:13:23.479 align:start position:0%
getting shocked
 
03:13:26.809 --> 03:13:26.819 align:start position:0%
every so often so to me I think that's
 
03:13:29.150 --> 03:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
an advantage people at least have a good
 
03:13:31.969 --> 03:13:31.979 align:start position:0%
expectation of uh pretty close to what
 
03:13:33.290 --> 03:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
they might be paying every month except
 
03:13:36.110 --> 03:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
being surprised with big jumps and so
 
03:13:39.290 --> 03:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
forth so so if the purpose of the
 
03:13:42.429 --> 03:13:42.439 align:start position:0%
original bill hb159 was to average
 
03:13:44.570 --> 03:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
default service costs I think it was
 
03:13:45.950 --> 03:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
five years representative Mickey
 
03:13:45.960 --> 03:13:48.050 align:start position:0%
five years representative Mickey
Williams

03:13:48.050 --> 03:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
Williams
 
03:13:50.870 --> 03:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
yes the intent of the original bill was
 
03:13:53.450 --> 03:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
to allow up to five years to and this
 
03:13:55.670 --> 03:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
was as amended it was attempted to be
 
03:13:57.950 --> 03:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
amended the day it was presented uh
 
03:14:00.230 --> 03:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
there was an issue where this committee
 
03:14:01.849 --> 03:14:01.859 align:start position:0%
did not allow amendments the day it was
 
03:14:03.469 --> 03:14:03.479 align:start position:0%
presented but that was the presented
 
03:14:05.450 --> 03:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
amendment was laddering up to five years
 
03:14:08.389 --> 03:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
so therefore your term could be very
 
03:14:10.429 --> 03:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
short say two months three months or it
 
03:14:12.710 --> 03:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
could be a five year to create a pie
 
03:14:15.469 --> 03:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
chart mix where you have some very risky
 
03:14:18.349 --> 03:14:18.359 align:start position:0%
and some very not risky investments in
 
03:14:20.510 --> 03:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
long-term and short-term together which
 
03:14:22.490 --> 03:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
as representative Thomas acknowledged
 
03:14:25.969 --> 03:14:25.979 align:start position:0%
then therefore averages out the overall
 
03:14:28.130 --> 03:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
cost and we don't have surprises for our
 
03:14:30.889 --> 03:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
constituents who receive a bill in the
 
03:14:33.950 --> 03:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
winter that is just crazy expensive
 
03:14:36.410 --> 03:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
so it is an averaging Bill and as
 
03:14:38.330 --> 03:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington just explained
 
03:14:43.190 --> 03:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
laddering is also an averaging technique
 
03:14:46.849 --> 03:14:46.859 align:start position:0%
so the question then becomes
 
03:14:52.309 --> 03:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
should we go with the laddering bill and
 
03:14:52.319 --> 03:14:53.530 align:start position:0%
should we go with the laddering bill and
either

03:14:53.530 --> 03:14:53.540 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:14:57.170 --> 03:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
interim study or itl this bill or take
 
03:14:58.790 --> 03:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
another path
 
03:15:01.190 --> 03:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
 
03:15:01.200 --> 03:15:02.450 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
chairman

03:15:02.450 --> 03:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:15:05.630 --> 03:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
um well I think our recommendation would
 
03:15:08.030 --> 03:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
be that we ought to pass as amended the
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
bill that was submitted under hb159 but
 
03:15:13.010 --> 03:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
you had alluded when you opened uh the
 
03:15:15.590 --> 03:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
session that that the bill was somehow
 
03:15:15.600 --> 03:15:18.110 align:start position:0%
session that that the bill was somehow
unconstitutional

03:15:18.110 --> 03:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
03:15:20.030 --> 03:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
um and I thought maybe you could speak
 
03:15:22.550 --> 03:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
to that piece of why you have exception
 
03:15:24.290 --> 03:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
to the bill and I didn't know whether
 
03:15:26.269 --> 03:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
you were talking about the bill
 
03:15:30.110 --> 03:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
in its original form or as amended
 
03:15:32.330 --> 03:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
I think I was talking about the bill in
 
03:15:33.769 --> 03:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
its original form
 
03:15:36.050 --> 03:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
and I recall and he can correct me if
 
03:15:39.410 --> 03:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong that Mr locata from eversource
 
03:15:42.849 --> 03:15:42.859 align:start position:0%
testified that averaging over five years
 
03:15:46.190 --> 03:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
would deprive the utility of the ability
 
03:15:50.050 --> 03:15:50.060 align:start position:0%
to recover its costs in any given year
 
03:15:53.030 --> 03:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
potentially which would be a violation
 
03:15:54.710 --> 03:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
of the takings Clause of the
 
03:16:05.870 --> 03:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:08.450 --> 03:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yeah yes that is correct
 
03:16:12.530 --> 03:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
the issue becomes when the cost that the
 
03:16:16.370 --> 03:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
utility incurs by procuring the power is
 
03:16:18.349 --> 03:16:18.359 align:start position:0%
different than the cost that the utility
 
03:16:21.349 --> 03:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
is allowed to recover so if it's again
 
03:16:23.510 --> 03:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
just speaking to the original Bill if it
 
03:16:25.610 --> 03:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
was a five-year average of regional
 
03:16:25.620 --> 03:16:26.630 align:start position:0%
was a five-year average of regional
rates

03:16:26.630 --> 03:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
rates
 
03:16:29.750 --> 03:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
let's say that was 10 cents but the
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
utility went out to purchase the power
 
03:16:34.130 --> 03:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
from the market and let's say that was
 
03:16:36.349 --> 03:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
12 cents essentially the utility is
 
03:16:38.269 --> 03:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
unable to recover the cost that it
 
03:16:40.670 --> 03:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
incurred uh to provide service to the
 
03:16:44.929 --> 03:16:44.939 align:start position:0%
customer so uh as uh chairman vo said uh
 
03:16:47.269 --> 03:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
that would constitute a taking under the
 
03:16:49.550 --> 03:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
the Constitution
 
03:16:51.830 --> 03:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
03:16:57.889 --> 03:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:57.899 --> 03:17:00.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:03.170 --> 03:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams just be clear
 
03:17:07.010 --> 03:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
I'm advocating for the amendment the 159
 
03:17:08.750 --> 03:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
as amended I think we all agree that
 
03:17:10.130 --> 03:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
there were issues with the underlying
 
03:17:12.410 --> 03:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
bill but I think that there is something
 
03:17:14.090 --> 03:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
here that's worth working on with the
 
03:17:16.550 --> 03:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
amendment certainly for laddering and it
 
03:17:18.410 --> 03:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
sounds like representative Bernardi has
 
03:17:20.510 --> 03:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
already put something into OLS to start
 
03:17:23.330 --> 03:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
the process for next year so having a
 
03:17:25.490 --> 03:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
working group now might be a really good
 
03:17:27.769 --> 03:17:27.779 align:start position:0%
idea because we could have a nice
 
03:17:29.990 --> 03:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan discussion about all of these
 
03:17:32.990 --> 03:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
options and perhaps even weigh in on the
 
03:17:34.550 --> 03:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation before it's
 
03:17:37.670 --> 03:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
finalized with OLS so we can have a
 
03:17:39.590 --> 03:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
really good bipartisan consensus coming
 
03:17:42.410 --> 03:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
into Lottery for January rather than
 
03:17:44.929 --> 03:17:44.939 align:start position:0%
waiting until January to see what OLS
 
03:17:46.730 --> 03:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
drafts and then having to create a
 
03:17:48.170 --> 03:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
subcommittee within this committee
 
03:17:50.750 --> 03:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
February March to do the same thing that
 
03:17:52.250 --> 03:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
we could do now in the next couple of
 
03:17:55.010 --> 03:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
weeks so what I'm proposing is we go
 
03:17:56.990 --> 03:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
with the amendment and even if we vote
 
03:17:58.370 --> 03:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
Yes or no we'll still have the
 
03:17:59.809 --> 03:17:59.819 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work together on
 
03:18:01.670 --> 03:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
laddering now
 
03:18:04.790 --> 03:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so can you refresh our
 
03:18:06.590 --> 03:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
memory about what the amendment contains
 
03:18:08.809 --> 03:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
because I just looked in the folder and
 
03:18:10.849 --> 03:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
there is no copy of the amendment in the
 
03:18:10.859 --> 03:18:13.250 align:start position:0%
there is no copy of the amendment in the
folder

03:18:13.250 --> 03:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:17.530 --> 03:18:17.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:20.030 --> 03:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman while she's looking at that
 
03:18:21.469 --> 03:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
I just want to make one other comment on
 
03:18:21.479 --> 03:18:22.550 align:start position:0%
I just want to make one other comment on
this

03:18:22.550 --> 03:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:18:24.830 --> 03:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
um go ahead the bill I don't know if the
 
03:18:26.570 --> 03:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses this but this talks
 
03:18:28.490 --> 03:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
for using the five-year average of
 
03:18:30.710 --> 03:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
retail rates from the New England region
 
03:18:33.469 --> 03:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
which would mean it would be based on
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
things that are happening outside of New
 
03:18:37.070 --> 03:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which we have no control over
 
03:18:38.750 --> 03:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I want to be allowing
 
03:18:41.030 --> 03:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
things that Rhode Island does to set the
 
03:18:42.590 --> 03:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
electric rates in New Hampshire because
 
03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
they could do things that would drive up
 
03:18:46.910 --> 03:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
the retail cost but maybe at the
 
03:18:48.170 --> 03:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
advantage of the people in Rhode Island
 
03:18:50.210 --> 03:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
but nothing to New Hampshire so I think
 
03:18:51.889 --> 03:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
that's another issue here and also
 
03:18:53.990 --> 03:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of discussion lately
 
03:18:56.269 --> 03:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
over looking at
 
03:18:58.250 --> 03:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
a different way of procuring completely
 
03:18:59.870 --> 03:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
like going to the market sort of like
 
03:19:02.809 --> 03:19:02.819 align:start position:0%
the way the uh the co-op does or some
 
03:19:04.550 --> 03:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
modification of that and I think there's
 
03:19:07.910 --> 03:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
a report coming out of Des in I believe
 
03:19:11.210 --> 03:19:11.220 align:start position:0%
it's December the beginning end of
 
03:19:12.290 --> 03:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
December they're supposed to address
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
that because there was a preliminary
 
03:19:16.370 --> 03:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
study done by the puc they said if you
 
03:19:18.650 --> 03:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
looked back over the last five years I
 
03:19:20.030 --> 03:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
think they went back two five-year
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
groups and you looked at what the actual
 
03:19:26.210 --> 03:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
lmps were as a basis and compared to
 
03:19:29.090 --> 03:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
getting contracts you would have saved
 
03:19:30.950 --> 03:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
money going that direction so that's
 
03:19:32.330 --> 03:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
another thing that could be considered
 
03:19:34.490 --> 03:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
in this upcoming bill as well
 
03:19:38.030 --> 03:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
03:19:41.090 --> 03:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
that five-year piece was proposed with
 
03:19:42.950 --> 03:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
the original Bill not the amended Bill
 
03:19:44.809 --> 03:19:44.819 align:start position:0%
the amended bill doesn't look to other
 
03:19:46.610 --> 03:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
states the amended bill is just about
 
03:19:47.870 --> 03:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:19:50.030 --> 03:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
yeah um so
 
03:19:51.590 --> 03:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
so what I'm proposing is we put together
 
03:19:53.570 --> 03:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee to talk about laddering
 
03:19:55.190 --> 03:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
because I think it's important that
 
03:19:57.170 --> 03:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
everyone who's concerned about electric
 
03:19:58.969 --> 03:19:58.979 align:start position:0%
rates and laddering have an opportunity
 
03:20:01.070 --> 03:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
to discuss that and potentially have
 
03:20:02.870 --> 03:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
some input on this proposed bill for
 
03:20:03.889 --> 03:20:03.899 align:start position:0%
next year
 
03:20:06.590 --> 03:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
the timing is right I'm not saying that
 
03:20:08.389 --> 03:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
I want to pass the amended bill but I'm
 
03:20:09.830 --> 03:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
also saying let's not throw out the baby
 
03:20:11.809 --> 03:20:11.819 align:start position:0%
with the bath water and wait another six
 
03:20:14.030 --> 03:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
months before we address this so my
 
03:20:16.070 --> 03:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
proposal is let's have a subcommittee
 
03:20:17.630 --> 03:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
let's talk let's come up with some
 
03:20:19.730 --> 03:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
recommended best practices and whether
 
03:20:21.769 --> 03:20:21.779 align:start position:0%
the recommendation from the subcommittee
 
03:20:23.330 --> 03:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
is yes we love what we talked about
 
03:20:26.750 --> 03:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
let's pass it as further amended or no I
 
03:20:27.889 --> 03:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill will work but
 
03:20:28.969 --> 03:20:28.979 align:start position:0%
we're going to come up with something
 
03:20:31.370 --> 03:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
excellent that can work for next year I
 
03:20:33.050 --> 03:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
think the timing right now makes sense
 
03:20:35.450 --> 03:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
for us to have a subcommittee to work on
 
03:20:37.070 --> 03:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
it and that's what I'm pitching it's not
 
03:20:39.769 --> 03:20:39.779 align:start position:0%
about original 159 it's not even about
 
03:20:43.550 --> 03:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
159 as amended with the language related
 
03:20:46.250 --> 03:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
03:20:48.170 --> 03:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
related to New Hampshire's wholesale
 
03:20:50.690 --> 03:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
Market which is a very
 
03:20:52.730 --> 03:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
it's a very broad term about New
 
03:20:54.050 --> 03:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it doesn't relate to Rhode
 
03:20:55.969 --> 03:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
Island or any other state
 
03:20:57.590 --> 03:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
um I think really what we want to do is
 
03:21:00.590 --> 03:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
just have some good fact finding now so
 
03:21:02.389 --> 03:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
that we can be prepared for when we
 
03:21:03.889 --> 03:21:03.899 align:start position:0%
start again as a committee in January
 
03:21:05.570 --> 03:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
and that's my pitch that's really what I
 
03:21:06.950 --> 03:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
think we want to do as responsible
 
03:21:09.349 --> 03:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
legislators to our constituents and to
 
03:21:12.110 --> 03:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
the Electric market as it is let's bring
 
03:21:14.210 --> 03:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
in some experts have really good
 
03:21:16.490 --> 03:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
testimony let's discuss pros and cons
 
03:21:17.990 --> 03:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
and let's come up with a strategy for
 
03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
laddering for next year's Bill thank you
 
03:21:25.570 --> 03:21:25.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:28.429 --> 03:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
2023.0557h as in horse
 
03:21:28.439 --> 03:21:29.570 align:start position:0%
2023.0557h as in horse
yep

03:21:29.570 --> 03:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:21:31.670 --> 03:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
any further comment on whether or not we
 
03:21:33.590 --> 03:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
should form a subcommittee for
 
03:21:36.050 --> 03:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
researching this issue
 
03:21:38.150 --> 03:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative nodder
 
03:21:40.309 --> 03:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman with our limited
 
03:21:42.710 --> 03:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
time and so many bills to consider I
 
03:21:44.389 --> 03:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
think it's better to start to start with
 
03:21:47.090 --> 03:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
a clean bill in January than an amended
 
03:21:47.100 --> 03:21:48.830 align:start position:0%
a clean bill in January than an amended
one

03:21:48.830 --> 03:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:21:55.250 --> 03:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh
 
03:22:00.889 --> 03:22:00.899 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with forming a subcommittee to
 
03:22:02.450 --> 03:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
study this question
 
03:22:04.670 --> 03:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
do we have volunteers I need at least
 
03:22:04.680 --> 03:22:06.110 align:start position:0%
do we have volunteers I need at least
three

03:22:06.110 --> 03:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:22:12.769 --> 03:22:12.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:18.830 --> 03:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:25.309 --> 03:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:31.790 --> 03:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:34.190 --> 03:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
03:22:40.849 --> 03:22:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:42.349 --> 03:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
all right I think that's enough members
 
03:22:44.530 --> 03:22:44.540 align:start position:0%
of that subcommittee I will appoint
 
03:22:46.730 --> 03:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi to be the chair
 
03:22:50.450 --> 03:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
of that committee and you guys can
 
03:22:52.070 --> 03:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
get together and figure out when you
 
03:22:55.490 --> 03:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
want to start meeting and just recall or
 
03:22:58.370 --> 03:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
remember that we'll need to have you'll
 
03:23:01.010 --> 03:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
need to wrap up your work
 
03:23:05.269 --> 03:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
on or before October 31st
 
03:23:07.309 --> 03:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
the executive session will probably be
 
03:23:10.429 --> 03:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
in early November
 
03:23:13.010 --> 03:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
I'll have to look at the House calendar
 
03:23:15.229 --> 03:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
to be sure exactly when our final date
 
03:23:18.950 --> 03:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
for dealing with this issue is but
 
03:23:24.110 --> 03:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:41.750 --> 03:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay next is HB 166 relative to the
 
03:23:46.729 --> 03:23:46.739 align:start position:0%
elimination of useful thermal energy
 
03:23:51.469 --> 03:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:53.929 --> 03:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
I think the recommendation for this bill
 
03:23:57.349 --> 03:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
is itl does anyone have any further
 
03:23:59.929 --> 03:23:59.939 align:start position:0%
comments on it representative Harrington
 
03:24:01.550 --> 03:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I realize this bill isn't going
 
03:24:03.530 --> 03:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
anywhere but it's I guess might call it
 
03:24:05.389 --> 03:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
my pet peeve we want I think the people
 
03:24:07.309 --> 03:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire let rate pays should
 
03:24:09.530 --> 03:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
know what they're paying for and paying
 
03:24:11.690 --> 03:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
for somebody to heat a factory that has
 
03:24:12.889 --> 03:24:12.899 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with electric rates
 
03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be subsidized by the electric
 
03:24:16.910 --> 03:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
rate payers but it is I realize it's not
 
03:24:19.309 --> 03:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
going to pass just itl it and I just
 
03:24:22.190 --> 03:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
request don't put it on consent
 
03:24:22.200 --> 03:24:23.570 align:start position:0%
request don't put it on consent
okay

03:24:23.570 --> 03:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:24:28.190 --> 03:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:29.750 --> 03:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
03:24:33.830 --> 03:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
we will move on to House Bill 175
 
03:24:35.389 --> 03:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
relative to the state's energy
 
03:24:37.370 --> 03:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
consumption goal
 
03:24:40.010 --> 03:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
once again this bill has come before us
 
03:24:43.010 --> 03:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
before and didn't gain any traction
 
03:24:45.410 --> 03:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
I suspect itl might be the best way to
 
03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:57.650 --> 03:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
that's the bill where you changed the
 
03:24:57.660 --> 03:24:58.929 align:start position:0%
that's the bill where you changed the
word

03:24:58.929 --> 03:24:58.939 align:start position:0%
word
 
03:25:01.490 --> 03:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels to greenhouse gases this
 
03:25:02.809 --> 03:25:02.819 align:start position:0%
was requested at one time by the
 
03:25:04.550 --> 03:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
department of energy I even heard much
 
03:25:07.309 --> 03:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
back from him on it so I guess it's not
 
03:25:10.490 --> 03:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:10.500 --> 03:25:11.929 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:25:11.929 --> 03:25:11.939 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:25:13.729 --> 03:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
moving on
 
03:25:16.550 --> 03:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
HP 176 relative to the rules of the site
 
03:25:19.729 --> 03:25:19.739 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
03:25:19.739 --> 03:25:21.170 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
pardon

03:25:21.170 --> 03:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
pardon
 
03:25:23.450 --> 03:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
yeah we're gonna well
 
03:25:25.610 --> 03:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
we haven't taken a formal vote but the
 
03:25:29.570 --> 03:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
recommendation is itl at this point
 
03:25:29.580 --> 03:25:30.170 align:start position:0%
recommendation is itl at this point
um

03:25:30.170 --> 03:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:32.990 --> 03:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
HB 176 relative to the rules of the site
 
03:25:34.910 --> 03:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee representative
 
03:25:37.309 --> 03:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
Harrington you have a comment
 
03:25:37.319 --> 03:25:40.330 align:start position:0%
Harrington you have a comment
uh

03:25:40.330 --> 03:25:40.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:43.490 --> 03:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
this is a what is it 176 I don't have it
 
03:25:45.590 --> 03:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
from me I believe this is the one that
 
03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
basically says make the rules fit the
 
03:25:50.210 --> 03:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
law and I'd like to see this go forward
 
03:25:52.429 --> 03:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
there was uh five or six years ago maybe
 
03:25:54.469 --> 03:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
longer than that now there was a bill
 
03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
passed that put a lot of additional
 
03:25:58.370 --> 03:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
restrictions on wind power it was right
 
03:26:01.849 --> 03:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
after the antrum wind projects and the
 
03:26:03.650 --> 03:26:03.660 align:start position:0%
law basically said these apply to win
 
03:26:05.389 --> 03:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
projects and when they wrote the rules
 
03:26:08.690 --> 03:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
at the puc at the time put those uh put
 
03:26:10.910 --> 03:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
those uh restrictions and requirements
 
03:26:14.090 --> 03:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
on all energy projects uh and that
 
03:26:16.550 --> 03:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
simply was overstretched what they did I
 
03:26:18.170 --> 03:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the house at the time nor on
 
03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
the puc I tried to get involved and was
 
03:26:22.429 --> 03:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
basically told by a senator on gel car
 
03:26:24.110 --> 03:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
no one knows what they're talking about
 
03:26:25.429 --> 03:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
anyways we're not going to waste any
 
03:26:26.690 --> 03:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
more time on this we're passing the
 
03:26:29.750 --> 03:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
rules as is so this would simply say and
 
03:26:31.130 --> 03:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
I guess it would probably be directed
 
03:26:33.349 --> 03:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
back to the Department of energy now go
 
03:26:36.769 --> 03:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
fix the rules to match the law and it's
 
03:26:37.910 --> 03:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward I would think
 
03:26:39.469 --> 03:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
everyone would be in favor of not
 
03:26:41.530 --> 03:26:41.540 align:start position:0%
allowing uh
 
03:26:43.790 --> 03:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
agencies like the puc to create
 
03:26:46.010 --> 03:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
legislation they should Implement what's
 
03:26:48.530 --> 03:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
passed by this house
 
03:26:52.670 --> 03:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:55.490 --> 03:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yeah well I
 
03:26:56.750 --> 03:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the explanation from
 
03:26:58.670 --> 03:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I think that
 
03:26:58.680 --> 03:26:59.510 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I think that
sounds

03:26:59.510 --> 03:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
sounds
 
03:27:04.210 --> 03:27:04.220 align:start position:0%
vague being put asking doe to
 
03:27:07.370 --> 03:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
modify the rules to fit the law and so I
 
03:27:09.650 --> 03:27:09.660 align:start position:0%
think the if that bill were to go
 
03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
forward it would require I think uh more
 
03:27:16.910 --> 03:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
specific instruction from us in terms of
 
03:27:18.889 --> 03:27:18.899 align:start position:0%
what is intended because it seems like
 
03:27:20.090 --> 03:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other things that
 
03:27:21.050 --> 03:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
could be
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
ratified under something that's as vague
 
03:27:25.429 --> 03:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
as that so I I would still be in favor
 
03:27:28.309 --> 03:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
of itl if I could respond Mr chairman
 
03:27:28.319 --> 03:27:29.650 align:start position:0%
of itl if I could respond Mr chairman
yes

03:27:29.650 --> 03:27:29.660 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:27:32.929 --> 03:27:32.939 align:start position:0%
in the bill directly it says in order to
 
03:27:34.370 --> 03:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
amend the rules pursuant to section one
 
03:27:36.349 --> 03:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
of this the committee shall include but
 
03:27:38.570 --> 03:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
not limited to the following and like
 
03:27:41.150 --> 03:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
site rule the specific rule requiring
 
03:27:42.830 --> 03:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
the committee to conduct an adjunitive
 
03:27:44.510 --> 03:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
hearing again blah blah blah and then it
 
03:27:47.630 --> 03:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
says another site Rule 30105 and then on
 
03:27:50.990 --> 03:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
the site rule 30108 in site rule 30108
 
03:27:54.050 --> 03:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
C4 so it's very specific we list the
 
03:27:55.370 --> 03:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
different places where they have to
 
03:27:57.769 --> 03:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
change the rules does it not does it say
 
03:28:00.469 --> 03:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
what they are it's it lists the rule
 
03:28:02.330 --> 03:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
right right in the bill and you can go
 
03:28:03.889 --> 03:28:03.899 align:start position:0%
to the thing it says it says this
 
03:28:05.630 --> 03:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
requires all energy facilities to have
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
an emergency response plan there is no
 
03:28:10.550 --> 03:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
such requirement in RSA 162h they just
 
03:28:11.510 --> 03:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
made it up
 
03:28:15.229 --> 03:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
so it's very specific in the bill
 
03:28:17.330 --> 03:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
to follow up on representative McGee's
 
03:28:17.340 --> 03:28:18.710 align:start position:0%
to follow up on representative McGee's
question

03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:28:20.990 --> 03:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
starting on line three of the bill it
 
03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
starting on line three of the bill it
says

03:28:22.070 --> 03:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
says
 
03:28:23.990 --> 03:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
no later than 60 days after the
 
03:28:25.610 --> 03:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
effective date of this paragraph the
 
03:28:28.910 --> 03:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
committee shall initiate a proceeding to
 
03:28:32.210 --> 03:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
amend adopted rules site 100 through
 
03:28:34.429 --> 03:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
site 300.
 
03:28:37.010 --> 03:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
to ensure that no Authority is assumed
 
03:28:38.210 --> 03:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
to the committee that is not
 
03:28:42.170 --> 03:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized by RSA 162-h
 
03:28:45.170 --> 03:28:45.180 align:start position:0%
but then section two only mentions one
 
03:28:48.530 --> 03:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
two three four specific rules
 
03:28:53.630 --> 03:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
all in in the 301 section of the rules
 
03:28:56.090 --> 03:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
so I think the reason this bill didn't
 
03:28:58.309 --> 03:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
get traction earlier representative
 
03:29:03.130 --> 03:29:03.140 align:start position:0%
Harrington is because it it seems to be
 
03:29:03.140 --> 03:29:04.849 align:start position:0%
Harrington is because it it seems to be
directing

03:29:04.849 --> 03:29:04.859 align:start position:0%
directing
 
03:29:07.729 --> 03:29:07.739 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee to do an a
 
03:29:10.130 --> 03:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
review of rules
 
03:29:10.140 --> 03:29:12.229 align:start position:0%
review of rules
that's

03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:29:14.750 --> 03:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
quite extensive
 
03:29:18.110 --> 03:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
even though the bill only wants it to
 
03:29:21.110 --> 03:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
look at four specific rules
 
03:29:23.150 --> 03:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
is there a way to tighten it up and and
 
03:29:25.670 --> 03:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
make are these the only four rules you
 
03:29:27.969 --> 03:29:27.979 align:start position:0%
think need to be reviewed well it says
 
03:29:30.889 --> 03:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
the shall include but not limited to I
 
03:29:33.170 --> 03:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
could live with just having it do these
 
03:29:34.429 --> 03:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
these four ones so they're certainly
 
03:29:37.070 --> 03:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
better than having none because uh you
 
03:29:38.330 --> 03:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
know having these things like an
 
03:29:40.190 --> 03:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
emergency response plan for a solar
 
03:29:42.110 --> 03:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
facility is kind of ridiculous it was
 
03:29:43.849 --> 03:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
never the intent of the law we have
 
03:29:45.349 --> 03:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
trouble enough citing things in New
 
03:29:47.389 --> 03:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and putting make having
 
03:29:49.130 --> 03:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
committees make up requirements that
 
03:29:53.870 --> 03:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:56.990 --> 03:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
so would the committee be open to
 
03:30:02.210 --> 03:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:05.929 --> 03:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
restrict the site evaluation committee
 
03:30:09.229 --> 03:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
rules review to just the four rules
 
03:30:17.090 --> 03:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:19.550 --> 03:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
no comment
 
03:30:39.070 --> 03:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:41.570 --> 03:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
well it would obviously mean that the
 
03:30:43.309 --> 03:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee administrator
 
03:30:46.370 --> 03:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
who happens to be in the room would
 
03:30:48.729 --> 03:30:48.739 align:start position:0%
probably have to take on this
 
03:30:52.010 --> 03:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
responsibility or at least to guide the
 
03:30:56.990 --> 03:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:02.210 --> 03:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:04.790 --> 03:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
03:31:07.510 --> 03:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think the the
 
03:31:09.969 --> 03:31:09.979 align:start position:0%
administrator could
 
03:31:12.950 --> 03:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
readily take on the four identified
 
03:31:16.969 --> 03:31:16.979 align:start position:0%
items and propose those to the a full
 
03:31:18.889 --> 03:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
committee and the next time they met and
 
03:31:22.790 --> 03:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
and address this issue I agree that if
 
03:31:25.670 --> 03:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's expansive going through sections
 
03:31:28.610 --> 03:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
100 through 300 and everything contained
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:34.550 --> 03:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
so representative Harrington would you
 
03:31:37.670 --> 03:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
be willing to create an amendment to
 
03:31:39.410 --> 03:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
restrict the bill to just those four
 
03:31:41.269 --> 03:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
sure you just have to take out a few
 
03:31:43.910 --> 03:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
words there's no problem with that okay
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
so going forward then it looks like what
 
03:31:49.610 --> 03:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
we will do with HB 176 is
 
03:31:52.849 --> 03:31:52.859 align:start position:0%
otpa unless there is further comment on
 
03:31:57.950 --> 03:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:59.690 --> 03:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
and representative Harrington will
 
03:31:59.700 --> 03:32:00.830 align:start position:0%
and representative Harrington will
prepare

03:32:00.830 --> 03:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
prepare
 
03:32:04.729 --> 03:32:04.739 align:start position:0%
an amendment on this bill okay good
 
03:32:06.950 --> 03:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
next is Mississippi can we make sure
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's circulated before we have the
 
03:32:08.520 --> 03:32:10.490 align:start position:0%
that's circulated before we have the
exact

03:32:10.490 --> 03:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
exact
 
03:32:13.250 --> 03:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
excuse me the amendment can we just make
 
03:32:14.929 --> 03:32:14.939 align:start position:0%
sure it's circulated before we have the
 
03:32:16.969 --> 03:32:16.979 align:start position:0%
exact so we don't have to learn about it
 
03:32:18.769 --> 03:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
there good suggestion representative
 
03:32:20.330 --> 03:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
Harrington could you circulate that
 
03:32:23.269 --> 03:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment sooner rather than later
 
03:32:25.070 --> 03:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:32:28.309 --> 03:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
okay HB 381 relative to solar generation
 
03:32:30.769 --> 03:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
under the renewable portfolio standards
 
03:32:33.349 --> 03:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that kind of undoes what
 
03:32:36.130 --> 03:32:36.140 align:start position:0%
HB 549 did
 
03:32:38.630 --> 03:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it would gain much traction
 
03:32:41.809 --> 03:32:41.819 align:start position:0%
I suggest itl any further Mr chairman
 
03:32:43.250 --> 03:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I'm a little
 
03:32:46.010 --> 03:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
confused I've got HB 381 relative to
 
03:32:47.929 --> 03:32:47.939 align:start position:0%
solar generation and renewable portfolio
 
03:32:49.969 --> 03:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
standards then on the other list over
 
03:32:52.370 --> 03:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
here I've got HP 381 relative to system
 
03:32:54.950 --> 03:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
benefits charge
 
03:32:56.570 --> 03:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
so is it just two different names for
 
03:33:08.269 --> 03:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:11.030 --> 03:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes you're right it is relative to the
 
03:33:17.210 --> 03:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:19.010 --> 03:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
and this has to do with whether it can
 
03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
be changed with uh by the puc or some
 
03:33:25.309 --> 03:33:25.319 align:start position:0%
other one would require that but my
 
03:33:28.010 --> 03:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
original comment still applies that this
 
03:33:32.530 --> 03:33:32.540 align:start position:0%
bill essentially undoes what HB 549 did
 
03:33:35.690 --> 03:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
and didn't seem to gain much traction
 
03:33:37.969 --> 03:33:37.979 align:start position:0%
within the committee its first time
 
03:33:40.849 --> 03:33:40.859 align:start position:0%
around but what is HP the one you just
 
03:33:48.349 --> 03:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:51.590 --> 03:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
you see the language that on starting on
 
03:33:54.170 --> 03:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
line eight all the way down to line 16
 
03:33:57.290 --> 03:33:57.300 align:start position:0%
that has been struck out that's language
 
03:34:06.050 --> 03:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:09.229 --> 03:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
HB 549 it had added a lot more language
 
03:34:12.410 --> 03:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
to statute but that language is
 
03:34:15.469 --> 03:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
uh essentially The crucial part
 
03:34:20.150 --> 03:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill and what it created and
 
03:34:20.160 --> 03:34:22.729 align:start position:0%
of the bill and what it created and
established

03:34:22.729 --> 03:34:22.739 align:start position:0%
established
 
03:34:24.830 --> 03:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
all right I guess this is getting no way
 
03:34:27.229 --> 03:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
so let's just get rid of it
 
03:34:30.170 --> 03:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll probably go with itl on
 
03:34:33.650 --> 03:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:37.550 --> 03:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
next is HB 548 relative to participation
 
03:34:40.030 --> 03:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
in net energy metering by small
 
03:34:42.710 --> 03:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric generators
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
this bill was identical to Senate Bill
 
03:34:48.229 --> 03:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
40 which we passed and the governor has
 
03:34:50.269 --> 03:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
signed into law so this bill is no
 
03:34:53.450 --> 03:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
longer necessary so I recommend itl any
 
03:34:58.670 --> 03:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:01.429 --> 03:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
next is hb509 relative to phasing out
 
03:35:08.330 --> 03:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
the minimal electric renewable portfolio
 
03:35:08.340 --> 03:35:09.710 align:start position:0%
the minimal electric renewable portfolio
standard

03:35:09.710 --> 03:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
standard
 
03:35:12.410 --> 03:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
this bill has written
 
03:35:12.420 --> 03:35:14.210 align:start position:0%
this bill has written
uh

03:35:14.210 --> 03:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:16.490 --> 03:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
calls for a
 
03:35:21.950 --> 03:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
phase out of the RPS by 2028 I believe
 
03:35:26.150 --> 03:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
but it presents us with an opportunity
 
03:35:28.790 --> 03:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
to create a study committee to determine
 
03:35:30.410 --> 03:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen with the RPS
 
03:35:33.530 --> 03:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
after 2025 because right now as written
 
03:35:37.190 --> 03:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
the RPS statute kind of stagnates in
 
03:35:37.200 --> 03:35:38.990 align:start position:0%
the RPS statute kind of stagnates in
2025.

03:35:38.990 --> 03:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
2025.
 
03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:40.670 align:start position:0%
2025.
and

03:35:40.670 --> 03:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
2025 although it may have seemed at one
 
03:35:46.670 --> 03:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
time to be a long way into the future is
 
03:35:48.769 --> 03:35:48.779 align:start position:0%
not that far away
 
03:35:48.779 --> 03:35:50.389 align:start position:0%
not that far away
so

03:35:50.389 --> 03:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:35:53.510 --> 03:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'm of the opinion that we might want to
 
03:35:56.389 --> 03:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
use this bill as a vehicle to just to
 
03:35:56.399 --> 03:35:57.530 align:start position:0%
use this bill as a vehicle to just to
study

03:35:57.530 --> 03:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
study
 
03:36:00.349 --> 03:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
what's next for the renewable portfolio
 
03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
standard now that may be too much of a
 
03:36:06.170 --> 03:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
job for a study committee that can only
 
03:36:08.450 --> 03:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
meet for two or three weeks
 
03:36:12.050 --> 03:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
but it could result in a an amendment to
 
03:36:13.309 --> 03:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:36:16.030 --> 03:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
that essentially says
 
03:36:20.330 --> 03:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
let's form a study committee
 
03:36:22.610 --> 03:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
to see what happens to the RPS after
 
03:36:22.620 --> 03:36:24.229 align:start position:0%
to see what happens to the RPS after
2025.

03:36:24.229 --> 03:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
2025.
 
03:36:28.670 --> 03:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:30.950 --> 03:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington you know the
 
03:36:33.410 --> 03:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill was as just like it
 
03:36:36.410 --> 03:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
says is to phase it out for those who
 
03:36:39.170 --> 03:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
weren't around when the RPS came out it
 
03:36:41.269 --> 03:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
was it was we needed to give the
 
03:36:43.849 --> 03:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
renewable energy a boost to get it going
 
03:36:47.090 --> 03:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
because it was a you know in an
 
03:36:48.950 --> 03:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
infantile uh
 
03:36:51.530 --> 03:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
method of producing electricity and it
 
03:36:54.530 --> 03:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
needed to help to get going and
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
eventually That was supposed to be was
 
03:36:57.889 --> 03:36:57.899 align:start position:0%
never supposed to be permanent it was
 
03:36:59.450 --> 03:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
once was up and running we've certainly
 
03:37:01.309 --> 03:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
seen a number of uh solar and wind
 
03:37:04.010 --> 03:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
projects and other Renewables now we
 
03:37:07.010 --> 03:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
also have the production tax credits uh
 
03:37:09.290 --> 03:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
uh and the investment tax credits which
 
03:37:11.389 --> 03:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
have been extended for probably forever
 
03:37:14.210 --> 03:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
under the crazy bills passed by Congress
 
03:37:16.910 --> 03:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
so my intent on this is was how long do
 
03:37:19.190 --> 03:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
we got to keep giving this holding up
 
03:37:21.050 --> 03:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
the hand of the Renewables I think it
 
03:37:22.849 --> 03:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
should be phased out especially with all
 
03:37:24.170 --> 03:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
the federal tax breaks they're getting
 
03:37:26.690 --> 03:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
so that was the intent of the bill
 
03:37:30.830 --> 03:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:33.710 --> 03:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan
 
03:37:37.190 --> 03:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I can understand the uh the uh the
 
03:37:40.370 --> 03:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
feeling for the need for uh eventual
 
03:37:43.729 --> 03:37:43.739 align:start position:0%
looking at the continued sub subsidy of
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
Renewables I mean it's
 
03:37:48.170 --> 03:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
you know it was implemented with the
 
03:37:50.110 --> 03:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
idea that it would that this infantile
 
03:37:52.610 --> 03:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
industry as you said would need a would
 
03:37:54.349 --> 03:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
need some sort of boost and it does it
 
03:37:55.790 --> 03:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
still need that boost I think it's an
 
03:37:57.170 --> 03:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
open question it's an interesting
 
03:37:59.210 --> 03:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
question I don't think we're ready to
 
03:38:01.729 --> 03:38:01.739 align:start position:0%
answer that question as as a committee
 
03:38:04.370 --> 03:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
here and if we wanted to to deal with
 
03:38:05.870 --> 03:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
that issue we would really need to look
 
03:38:07.729 --> 03:38:07.739 align:start position:0%
at it in depth and in you know a
 
03:38:11.210 --> 03:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
long-term study so um I think I agree
 
03:38:13.370 --> 03:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
with the the chairman I think that it it
 
03:38:14.929 --> 03:38:14.939 align:start position:0%
warrants a study committee but I don't
 
03:38:16.910 --> 03:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
agree with the intent of the underlying
 
03:38:19.550 --> 03:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
bill that we would be studying because I
 
03:38:21.290 --> 03:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
don't think we're ready to declare that
 
03:38:25.190 --> 03:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
the RPS is in need of elimination so
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't know where that leaves me but
 
03:38:28.610 --> 03:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
I I am in favor of looking at it as a
 
03:38:30.410 --> 03:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
03:38:34.969 --> 03:38:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:37.429 --> 03:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
 
03:38:40.250 --> 03:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
chairman I think in in our conversations
 
03:38:41.870 --> 03:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
as well I mentioned to you that
 
03:38:45.170 --> 03:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
currently this committee asks that the
 
03:38:46.729 --> 03:38:46.739 align:start position:0%
department of energy provide us with a
 
03:38:51.410 --> 03:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
report on on the status of the RPS each
 
03:38:55.910 --> 03:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
year in October I believe it is and we
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
um don't do a lot with that information
 
03:39:00.410 --> 03:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
that we receive already right we don't
 
03:39:02.929 --> 03:39:02.939 align:start position:0%
make an assessment of whether the RPS is
 
03:39:05.330 --> 03:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
work operating as we would like it to or
 
03:39:07.250 --> 03:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
if we're meeting our goals or should
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
increase our goals or lower our goals or
 
03:39:10.910 --> 03:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
I mean nobody lowers their goals because
 
03:39:12.950 --> 03:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's the point of the RPS is to really
 
03:39:14.830 --> 03:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
measure what you're doing in terms of
 
03:39:17.450 --> 03:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
penetration of various types of clean
 
03:39:19.250 --> 03:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
energy but
 
03:39:21.830 --> 03:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
we should probably make an effort to
 
03:39:26.690 --> 03:39:26.700 align:start position:0%
look at the information that we already
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
have and absorb that before we go
 
03:39:31.969 --> 03:39:31.979 align:start position:0%
forward with trying to certainly not
 
03:39:34.610 --> 03:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
eliminate it I mean we would have to
 
03:39:36.349 --> 03:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
have a good reason to eliminate it and I
 
03:39:37.610 --> 03:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
don't think the fact that there are
 
03:39:39.889 --> 03:39:39.899 align:start position:0%
federal subsidies trying to help people
 
03:39:41.870 --> 03:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
figure out how to implement cleaner
 
03:39:43.910 --> 03:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
sources I don't think that that's a
 
03:39:46.010 --> 03:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
reason for us to do away with a program
 
03:39:47.870 --> 03:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
that basically is designed to help us
 
03:39:51.229 --> 03:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
keep track of what we're doing in those
 
03:39:53.570 --> 03:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
sectors and make it easier for doe for
 
03:39:55.910 --> 03:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
example to measure how we're doing in
 
03:39:57.950 --> 03:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
those sectors if we take away the RPS
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
then the measurement goes away
 
03:40:03.650 --> 03:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
so I I'm opposed to uh moving forward
 
03:40:06.650 --> 03:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
with it I'm not opposed to a interim
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
study on it but
 
03:40:11.809 --> 03:40:11.819 align:start position:0%
um I think itl is probably appropriate
 
03:40:14.510 --> 03:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
and if we are going to look at the RPS I
 
03:40:16.429 --> 03:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
believe you Mr chairman have filed
 
03:40:18.110 --> 03:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
something on the RPS
 
03:40:21.050 --> 03:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
in the LSR system so I think we'll have
 
03:40:23.389 --> 03:40:23.399 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to look at it further in
 
03:40:25.010 --> 03:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
the coming year but I don't think we
 
03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:31.969 --> 03:40:31.979 align:start position:0%
since you brought it up I will mention
 
03:40:35.090 --> 03:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
that I have filed an LSR to change the
 
03:40:37.429 --> 03:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard to a clean
 
03:40:39.710 --> 03:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
energy portfolio standard
 
03:40:41.450 --> 03:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
because I wanted to start that
 
03:40:44.090 --> 03:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
conversation so I have filed a bill to
 
03:40:46.510 --> 03:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
give us an opportunity to do that
 
03:40:48.410 --> 03:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington did you have
 
03:40:50.570 --> 03:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
something else yeah I just uh I don't
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
want to stretch out a big argument on
 
03:40:53.530 --> 03:40:53.540 align:start position:0%
this thing but you know my point is that
 
03:40:55.490 --> 03:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
this was never supposed to be a
 
03:40:56.929 --> 03:40:56.939 align:start position:0%
permanent subsidy to people and it's
 
03:40:59.330 --> 03:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
also I don't think you can pick up a
 
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
paper or if anyone picks up papers
 
03:41:02.750 --> 03:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
anymore or put on the Internet or watch
 
03:41:04.250 --> 03:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
the television whatever without being
 
03:41:06.290 --> 03:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
constantly bombarded but we're all going
 
03:41:07.790 --> 03:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
to die from global warming in a couple
 
03:41:09.950 --> 03:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
of weeks so everybody in New Hampshire
 
03:41:12.469 --> 03:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
knows about global warming and carbon
 
03:41:14.690 --> 03:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
emission and zero based and all this so
 
03:41:16.729 --> 03:41:16.739 align:start position:0%
the fact then comes down to we consider
 
03:41:18.710 --> 03:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
them too stupid to make that decision on
 
03:41:20.450 --> 03:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
what type of electricity to buy because
 
03:41:22.370 --> 03:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
if they're all worried about global
 
03:41:23.809 --> 03:41:23.819 align:start position:0%
warming they'll all go out and buy
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
renewable energy you can go to the puc
 
03:41:27.710 --> 03:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
website and you can select someone to
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
give you 100 wind or wind and solar or
 
03:41:33.349 --> 03:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
whatever else and all I'm saying is I
 
03:41:34.550 --> 03:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
think people in New Hampshire are smart
 
03:41:36.410 --> 03:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
enough to make that decision they're no
 
03:41:37.790 --> 03:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
longer ignorant of the problem because
 
03:41:39.290 --> 03:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
they've certainly been inundated with it
 
03:41:41.330 --> 03:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
and we shouldn't as the state be saying
 
03:41:42.830 --> 03:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
you are too dumb to pick out the type of
 
03:41:44.450 --> 03:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
electricity you want so we're going to
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
pick it out for you and force you to buy
 
03:41:47.690 --> 03:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
something that you don't necessarily
 
03:41:47.700 --> 03:41:50.330 align:start position:0%
something that you don't necessarily
want

03:41:50.330 --> 03:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:53.809 --> 03:41:53.819 align:start position:0%
so we have this uh
 
03:41:55.849 --> 03:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
03:41:55.859 --> 03:41:58.070 align:start position:0%
kind of a
conflict

03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
03:41:59.690 --> 03:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
with regard to the bills we're
 
03:42:01.130 --> 03:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
discussing here
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
when we talked about hb159 we talked
 
03:42:06.530 --> 03:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
about trying to
 
03:42:08.389 --> 03:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
do something about the high cost of
 
03:42:08.399 --> 03:42:09.710 align:start position:0%
do something about the high cost of
energy

03:42:09.710 --> 03:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:42:11.030 --> 03:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
03:42:13.929 --> 03:42:13.939 align:start position:0%
on page 233 of Meredith's
 
03:42:15.950 --> 03:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
anguin's book
 
03:42:18.590 --> 03:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
she cited
 
03:42:21.710 --> 03:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
information from a 2015 study by energy
 
03:42:24.050 --> 03:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
tariff experts
 
03:42:26.170 --> 03:42:26.180 align:start position:0%
which revealed that
 
03:42:28.610 --> 03:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standards in New
 
03:42:30.769 --> 03:42:30.779 align:start position:0%
England costs varied from two to three
 
03:42:34.190 --> 03:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
cents per kilowatt hour in Maine to 1.1
 
03:42:36.710 --> 03:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
to 1.6 cents per kilowatt hour in
 
03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts with other states falling
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
in between
 
03:42:43.550 --> 03:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
she goes on to further State the rate
 
03:42:45.950 --> 03:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
payers nobody calls us customers pay
 
03:42:48.290 --> 03:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
these overhead expenses the price Rises
 
03:42:50.750 --> 03:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
caused by renewable portfolio standards
 
03:42:54.050 --> 03:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
are significant those are her words so
 
03:42:55.550 --> 03:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
here we are talking about trying to
 
03:42:58.309 --> 03:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
bring down the cost of energy
 
03:43:00.410 --> 03:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
but we've got a program here that
 
03:43:04.250 --> 03:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
actually drives up the cost of energy
 
03:43:07.429 --> 03:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering if there is some way we
 
03:43:10.870 --> 03:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
can reconcile those two conflicting
 
03:43:16.130 --> 03:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:18.170 --> 03:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
I think reconciling them is essential
 
03:43:20.269 --> 03:43:20.279 align:start position:0%
what we're here for however I would at
 
03:43:23.150 --> 03:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
this time suggest that forward rather
 
03:43:25.610 --> 03:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
than uh try to turn this bill into
 
03:43:27.050 --> 03:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
something and it's not and just give
 
03:43:31.750 --> 03:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:34.910 --> 03:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan
 
03:43:36.950 --> 03:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I think this conversation is is
 
03:43:39.590 --> 03:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
quickly smiled Way Beyond the scope of
 
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
the the build that we're supposed to be
 
03:43:44.150 --> 03:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
discussing so uh before I go I agree
 
03:43:45.769 --> 03:43:45.779 align:start position:0%
with the representative Parson before go
 
03:43:48.830 --> 03:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
any further we should just itl it
 
03:43:51.349 --> 03:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I I don't
 
03:43:52.309 --> 03:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
think the bill is going to go forward
 
03:43:54.349 --> 03:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
again I just want to let the board out
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
to the people of New Hampshire of what
 
03:43:57.769 --> 03:43:57.779 align:start position:0%
they're paying for on the electric bill
 
03:44:00.050 --> 03:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
I have no problem with itl as long as it
 
03:44:02.929 --> 03:44:02.939 align:start position:0%
doesn't go on the consent calendar
 
03:44:04.910 --> 03:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki
 
03:44:04.920 --> 03:44:06.229 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki
no

03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:44:08.150 --> 03:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
03:44:10.670 --> 03:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I my comment was really just a
 
03:44:12.710 --> 03:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
comment that you made about sort of that
 
03:44:15.290 --> 03:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
there's a cost to the RPS it's there's
 
03:44:17.269 --> 03:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
also a benefit to the RPS which is the
 
03:44:19.610 --> 03:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
reason that we're doing it and so the
 
03:44:20.630 --> 03:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know those are the kind of
 
03:44:22.070 --> 03:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
conversations we can have when your bill
 
03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
comes around but since this bill's
 
03:44:27.170 --> 03:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
premise is to phase out the RPS I I
 
03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
think we should just let it go we're not
 
03:44:31.670 --> 03:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
we're not going to agree that that's
 
03:44:31.680 --> 03:44:33.469 align:start position:0%
we're not going to agree that that's
um

03:44:33.469 --> 03:44:33.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:35.450 --> 03:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
something we want to do right now with
 
03:44:37.490 --> 03:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
the retained bill
 
03:44:39.889 --> 03:44:39.899 align:start position:0%
to pass that into law
 
03:44:43.729 --> 03:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:48.290 --> 03:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:51.290 --> 03:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
what was the decision on that is it Ito
 
03:44:52.910 --> 03:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
we're not going to form a study
 
03:44:55.309 --> 03:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I mean okay and then we'll
 
03:44:57.229 --> 03:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
discuss the outcome of the bill and
 
03:44:59.809 --> 03:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
03:45:01.510 --> 03:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
next is
 
03:45:04.729 --> 03:45:04.739 align:start position:0%
hb558 relative to micro grids and
 
03:45:07.849 --> 03:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
electric grid resiliency
 
03:45:10.370 --> 03:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
now I know that the prime sponsor of
 
03:45:12.290 --> 03:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
this bill who is Representative Keith
 
03:45:14.630 --> 03:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
Ammon has been working with the
 
03:45:16.670 --> 03:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and the utilities
 
03:45:19.429 --> 03:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
to come up with some amendments to the
 
03:45:19.439 --> 03:45:21.530 align:start position:0%
to come up with some amendments to the
bill

03:45:21.530 --> 03:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:45:21.540 --> 03:45:23.870 align:start position:0%
bill
and

03:45:23.870 --> 03:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:26.210 --> 03:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
apparently from what I've heard I was
 
03:45:27.950 --> 03:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
hoping representative Ammon might be
 
03:45:30.889 --> 03:45:30.899 align:start position:0%
here today but he's not so from what
 
03:45:32.150 --> 03:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
I've heard
 
03:45:35.510 --> 03:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment language May address the
 
03:45:38.330 --> 03:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
concerns of both the doe and the
 
03:45:40.910 --> 03:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
department of energy so the question is
 
03:45:43.550 --> 03:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
should we form a subcommittee to study
 
03:45:46.010 --> 03:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
the amendment which I'm sure we can get
 
03:45:47.469 --> 03:45:47.479 align:start position:0%
a copy of
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
promptly or should we just wait until we
 
03:45:53.690 --> 03:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
see the amendment and then decide what
 
03:45:54.530 --> 03:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:45:54.540 --> 03:45:57.170 align:start position:0%
to do
thoughts

03:45:57.170 --> 03:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas I think Mr when
 
03:46:03.050 --> 03:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
are we expecting to see the amendment
 
03:46:05.150 --> 03:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
03:46:14.750 --> 03:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chervos um
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
speaking as an engineer and someone who
 
03:46:18.889 --> 03:46:18.899 align:start position:0%
thinks linearly and also with a little
 
03:46:20.809 --> 03:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
bit of strategy I think it makes all the
 
03:46:22.250 --> 03:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
sense in the world to form a
 
03:46:24.410 --> 03:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and if we can't get a copy
 
03:46:27.410 --> 03:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
of the amendment just don't meet but the
 
03:46:29.510 --> 03:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
alternative is the amendment is still
 
03:46:31.190 --> 03:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
under discussion and we don't form a
 
03:46:32.750 --> 03:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so the first time we see
 
03:46:34.490 --> 03:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
the amendment is when we're voting just
 
03:46:36.889 --> 03:46:36.899 align:start position:0%
before October 31st I think
 
03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
strategically it probably makes more
 
03:46:40.370 --> 03:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
sense to form a subcommittee that may or
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
may not meet thank you Mr chair
 
03:46:45.530 --> 03:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
additional comments representative Wendy
 
03:46:48.349 --> 03:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
Thomas representative McWilliams has
 
03:46:52.190 --> 03:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:55.309 --> 03:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
further comments
 
03:46:58.250 --> 03:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with forming a subcommittee who
 
03:47:01.370 --> 03:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
wants to be on a micro grid subcommittee
 
03:47:03.050 --> 03:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand
 
03:47:11.650 --> 03:47:11.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas and
 
03:47:16.130 --> 03:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
representative Douglas Thomas
 
03:47:21.229 --> 03:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:28.429 --> 03:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
03:47:28.439 --> 03:47:32.929 align:start position:0%
anybody else
oops

03:47:32.929 --> 03:47:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:34.610 --> 03:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
okay so we have
 
03:47:37.729 --> 03:47:37.739 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas Wendy Thomas Tom closure and
 
03:47:41.150 --> 03:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
Kat McGee alaport Point Doug Thomas to
 
03:47:45.710 --> 03:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:45.720 --> 03:47:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:50.929 --> 03:47:50.939 align:start position:0%
it's only four people that's all who
 
03:47:50.939 --> 03:47:54.889 align:start position:0%
it's only four people that's all who
volunteered

03:47:54.889 --> 03:47:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:58.570 --> 03:47:58.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittees make recommendations so
 
03:48:04.370 --> 03:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
if you can't come to an agreement about
 
03:48:06.530 --> 03:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
your recommendation then they you just
 
03:48:08.630 --> 03:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
tell us that and then the rest of the
 
03:48:11.630 --> 03:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
committee will decide what to do
 
03:48:14.570 --> 03:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
okay so hb609 relative to energy
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:22.550 --> 03:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
house bill I mean Senate Bill 280 no
 
03:48:25.250 --> 03:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
House Bill 281 which was heavily amended
 
03:48:28.849 --> 03:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
by the Senate implemented some of the
 
03:48:30.889 --> 03:48:30.899 align:start position:0%
reforms that were contained in House
 
03:48:33.170 --> 03:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
Bill 609
 
03:48:36.349 --> 03:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
but there very likely are other reforms
 
03:48:37.670 --> 03:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
that we could make to the site
 
03:48:39.830 --> 03:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee so I recommend that
 
03:48:41.650 --> 03:48:41.660 align:start position:0%
we form a subcommittee
 
03:48:45.889 --> 03:48:45.899 align:start position:0%
to see what else can be done
 
03:48:49.729 --> 03:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
with hb609 if we strip out the six or
 
03:48:51.830 --> 03:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
eight pages of stuff that's already been
 
03:48:54.110 --> 03:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
implemented in law it'll be a much
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
smaller Bill much more compact so I
 
03:48:59.450 --> 03:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
recommend a subcommittee to study that
 
03:49:02.150 --> 03:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill and I will volunteer to be on that
 
03:49:02.160 --> 03:49:04.490 align:start position:0%
bill and I will volunteer to be on that
subcommittee

03:49:04.490 --> 03:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
03:49:07.070 --> 03:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
any other volunteers representative
 
03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
McGee Mr chairman I just wanted to make
 
03:49:12.950 --> 03:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
a comment we had uh 10 members of our
 
03:49:15.050 --> 03:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
committee at the New Hampshire energy
 
03:49:15.060 --> 03:49:16.370 align:start position:0%
committee at the New Hampshire energy
Summit

03:49:16.370 --> 03:49:16.380 align:start position:0%
Summit
 
03:49:20.330 --> 03:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
and that was on the 18th and there was a
 
03:49:23.269 --> 03:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
panel that discussed site evaluation
 
03:49:25.250 --> 03:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
committee changes that they would make
 
03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
so I think we have some good
 
03:49:28.309 --> 03:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations to bring to that study
 
03:49:30.229 --> 03:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
committee and I'll volunteer to be on it
 
03:49:32.389 --> 03:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
as well and I have the names of a couple
 
03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
of other people who also already said
 
03:49:36.050 --> 03:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
they'd be interested if you need more
 
03:49:36.060 --> 03:49:37.670 align:start position:0%
they'd be interested if you need more
names

03:49:37.670 --> 03:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
names
 
03:49:39.769 --> 03:49:39.779 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan you're
 
03:49:43.849 --> 03:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:49.010 --> 03:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:50.510 --> 03:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
03:49:55.370 --> 03:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:58.190 --> 03:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:00.710 --> 03:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay I will be the chair of that
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we have one two three four
 
03:50:07.550 --> 03:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
five members so we will proceed with
 
03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
that one
 
03:50:13.490 --> 03:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
that brings us to House Bill 616
 
03:50:15.650 --> 03:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
relative to administration of the New
 
03:50:17.690 --> 03:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's renewable portfolio standard
 
03:50:18.889 --> 03:50:18.899 align:start position:0%
this was a bill
 
03:50:22.250 --> 03:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
by representative McLean to
 
03:50:25.250 --> 03:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
add nuclear to the
 
03:50:29.030 --> 03:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard and we
 
03:50:31.490 --> 03:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
didn't think the bill at the time that
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
we passed judgment on it I and retained
 
03:50:35.570 --> 03:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
it I don't think we believe that the
 
03:50:37.550 --> 03:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
bill was ready there were too many
 
03:50:40.429 --> 03:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions about how this
 
03:50:40.439 --> 03:50:42.710 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions about how this
whole

03:50:42.710 --> 03:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
whole
 
03:50:45.170 --> 03:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
addition would
 
03:50:48.530 --> 03:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
work and affect the RPS
 
03:50:50.870 --> 03:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
so the question now is should we form a
 
03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to study this issue
 
03:50:58.969 --> 03:50:58.979 align:start position:0%
or should we study this issue when the
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
LSR that I've submitted to change the
 
03:51:04.370 --> 03:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard to a clean
 
03:51:07.309 --> 03:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
energy portfolio standard
 
03:51:09.229 --> 03:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
comes before us
 
03:51:11.690 --> 03:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
I vote for the ladder
 
03:51:14.389 --> 03:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
I vote for the latter okay
 
03:51:16.550 --> 03:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative Summers that's your clean
 
03:51:20.030 --> 03:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
energy LSR include nuclear yes it does
 
03:51:24.769 --> 03:51:24.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:28.729 --> 03:51:28.739 align:start position:0%
Okay so we will uh
 
03:51:31.849 --> 03:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
I tell this bill then is it likely to be
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
the representative Harrington on your
 
03:51:34.439 --> 03:51:35.269 align:start position:0%
the representative Harrington on your
bill

03:51:35.269 --> 03:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:51:37.790 --> 03:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
um does it this I believe this bill and
 
03:51:38.990 --> 03:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
I haven't looked at it while the one
 
03:51:41.150 --> 03:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
we're looking at right now also
 
03:51:41.160 --> 03:51:42.889 align:start position:0%
we're looking at right now also
basically

03:51:42.889 --> 03:51:42.899 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:51:46.490 --> 03:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
um just takes the renewable energy and
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
lumps them into one gets rid of the
 
03:51:49.969 --> 03:51:49.979 align:start position:0%
class system so it says somebody can go
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
out and this is how much renewable
 
03:51:52.910 --> 03:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
energy you must buy you figure out
 
03:51:54.290 --> 03:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to be solar or wind
 
03:51:56.570 --> 03:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
or qualifying Hydra or whatever does the
 
03:52:02.269 --> 03:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:05.030 --> 03:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
well as representative Bernardi said
 
03:52:08.150 --> 03:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
about his laddering bill the details are
 
03:52:10.790 --> 03:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
not nailed down at this point okay
 
03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
um I can certainly
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
add that to the bill
 
03:52:16.910 --> 03:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
or we could consider
 
03:52:19.849 --> 03:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
moving forward with this bill taking out
 
03:52:21.950 --> 03:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
the nuclear part and just considering
 
03:52:23.330 --> 03:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:52:27.769 --> 03:52:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:29.990 --> 03:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
anybody have any thoughts on that on
 
03:52:33.050 --> 03:52:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
I would think it would be cleaner to
 
03:52:36.410 --> 03:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
just do it all at once with the bill
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
coming up next year than try to work
 
03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
with two separate bills and okay it just
 
03:52:43.670 --> 03:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
seems too common census all right so
 
03:52:45.490 --> 03:52:45.500 align:start position:0%
we'll probably
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:58.070 --> 03:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
all right next is HB 622 repealing the
 
03:52:59.750 --> 03:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and sustainable energy
 
03:53:01.729 --> 03:53:01.739 align:start position:0%
board as you'll recall
 
03:53:05.570 --> 03:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
House Bill 281 is amended by the Senate
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
did that so this bill
 
03:53:12.170 --> 03:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
as it exists or as it is written
 
03:53:15.530 --> 03:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
is no longer useful but I suggest that
 
03:53:18.469 --> 03:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
we amend the bill by replacing the
 
03:53:21.650 --> 03:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
language in the bill with language that
 
03:53:25.010 --> 03:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
encourages the grid modernization
 
03:53:27.889 --> 03:53:27.899 align:start position:0%
Advisory Group that was created by
 
03:53:31.910 --> 03:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 166 last year to add Energy
 
03:53:38.090 --> 03:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:41.990 --> 03:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
we have language that has been offered
 
03:53:44.269 --> 03:53:44.279 align:start position:0%
to us that does that
 
03:53:47.150 --> 03:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
and I suggest that that might be the
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
best way to go at this bill your
 
03:53:48.840 --> 03:53:50.809 align:start position:0%
best way to go at this bill your
thoughts

03:53:50.809 --> 03:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
03:53:54.290 --> 03:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:01.490 --> 03:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
additional thoughts
 
03:54:03.710 --> 03:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
03:54:05.690 --> 03:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
are you proposing a subcommittee to
 
03:54:07.550 --> 03:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
discuss the language on the amendment or
 
03:54:09.170 --> 03:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
you just want to float an amendment that
 
03:54:12.530 --> 03:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
we can early before well before the 31st
 
03:54:15.950 --> 03:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'm proposing that we float an amendment
 
03:54:17.990 --> 03:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
that sounds good I'll submit that
 
03:54:22.070 --> 03:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment this week and once OLS
 
03:54:25.189 --> 03:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
prepares it I'll send out the amendment
 
03:54:28.250 --> 03:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
to the to the committee
 
03:54:28.260 --> 03:54:30.830 align:start position:0%
to the to the committee
okay

03:54:30.830 --> 03:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:54:33.950 --> 03:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
and last but not least is HB 631
 
03:54:37.610 --> 03:54:37.620 align:start position:0%
relative to electric utility smart meter
 
03:54:40.370 --> 03:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
Gateway devices
 
03:54:41.990 --> 03:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
03:54:45.830 --> 03:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
is a bill to uh
 
03:54:50.030 --> 03:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
allow customers optionally to purchase
 
03:54:53.210 --> 03:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
Smart Meters from their utility I guess
 
03:54:55.490 --> 03:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill states that it
 
03:54:58.130 --> 03:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
has to be a smart meter that the utility
 
03:55:05.750 --> 03:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:09.290 --> 03:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
so the question becomes do we want to
 
03:55:10.729 --> 03:55:10.739 align:start position:0%
allow this
 
03:55:12.110 --> 03:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
would it
 
03:55:14.210 --> 03:55:14.220 align:start position:0%
make a difference would anybody take
 
03:55:15.769 --> 03:55:15.779 align:start position:0%
advantage of it
 
03:55:18.349 --> 03:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
would anybody spend the extra money to
 
03:55:20.809 --> 03:55:20.819 align:start position:0%
buy a smart meter even though they might
 
03:55:25.130 --> 03:55:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:29.570 --> 03:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:33.410 --> 03:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
wait until the utilities decide
 
03:55:35.630 --> 03:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
how they want to use smart meters
 
03:55:37.729 --> 03:55:37.739 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas
 
03:55:41.389 --> 03:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um Mr chair we've
 
03:55:43.010 --> 03:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
gone through several of these type bills
 
03:55:44.689 --> 03:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
over the last several years and they
 
03:55:46.670 --> 03:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
haven't really gotten too much traction
 
03:55:48.590 --> 03:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
03:55:51.290 --> 03:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
like what you said in terms of waiting
 
03:55:53.450 --> 03:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
for the utilities to come out with
 
03:55:55.010 --> 03:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
something there's been questions about
 
03:55:56.630 --> 03:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
the definition of what a smart meter
 
03:55:58.670 --> 03:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
really is there's been concerns about
 
03:56:00.950 --> 03:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
health effects there's been concerns
 
03:56:03.110 --> 03:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
about privacy effects
 
03:56:05.750 --> 03:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think I would be in favor of
 
03:56:08.269 --> 03:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
just italing this bill
 
03:56:10.670 --> 03:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
other thoughts representative lewicki
 
03:56:12.710 --> 03:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:56:15.889 --> 03:56:15.899 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative Thomas I
 
03:56:17.570 --> 03:56:17.580 align:start position:0%
don't think that
 
03:56:19.309 --> 03:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
this is really a matter for legislation
 
03:56:20.750 --> 03:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
I think this is something that can be
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
between the utilities and their
 
03:56:24.290 --> 03:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
customers and if the utilities become
 
03:56:28.070 --> 03:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
invasive or you know amazing privacy or
 
03:56:30.650 --> 03:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
so forth then it may be a area for
 
03:56:33.290 --> 03:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
litigation rather than legislation
 
03:56:36.050 --> 03:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
additional thoughts representative McGee
 
03:56:38.030 --> 03:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
I had a bit of a hand in the original
 
03:56:40.429 --> 03:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
bill and I can tell you that the and I
 
03:56:42.290 --> 03:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
wasn't here when it was prevented
 
03:56:44.150 --> 03:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
because I was out
 
03:56:46.670 --> 03:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
um but the original intent of the bill
 
03:56:50.450 --> 03:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
was to make uh it non-mandatory but
 
03:56:52.429 --> 03:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
optional for customers to be able to
 
03:56:54.469 --> 03:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
upgrade the technology that they have in
 
03:56:56.929 --> 03:56:56.939 align:start position:0%
their home to a smart meter if they
 
03:56:59.389 --> 03:56:59.399 align:start position:0%
choose to and the idea is that the
 
03:57:01.790 --> 03:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
utilities would have to decide what
 
03:57:03.349 --> 03:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
grade of meter and what type of meter
 
03:57:04.790 --> 03:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate for people to
 
03:57:06.290 --> 03:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
purchase so that they would be able to
 
03:57:08.150 --> 03:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
contribute to the infrastructure that we
 
03:57:10.130 --> 03:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
will be moving to in the future because
 
03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
I think that information is already
 
03:57:14.750 --> 03:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
known and all of the utilities in New
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are not in the same place in
 
03:57:18.050 --> 03:57:18.060 align:start position:0%
terms of the upgrade of their
 
03:57:19.969 --> 03:57:19.979 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so that it has the
 
03:57:21.710 --> 03:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
technical capabilities to do certain
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
things that we'd like to see them do in
 
03:57:25.849 --> 03:57:25.859 align:start position:0%
the future and my thought was
 
03:57:28.670 --> 03:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
if a migration to
 
03:57:31.130 --> 03:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
um to smart meter technology ends up
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
being mandatory or being adopted by the
 
03:57:34.910 --> 03:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
utilities in the future that are not
 
03:57:36.830 --> 03:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
there yet then that would be a very
 
03:57:39.429 --> 03:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
expensive cost shift to the rate payers
 
03:57:43.309 --> 03:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
so the idea of allowing people to in a
 
03:57:44.990 --> 03:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary way people who are early
 
03:57:47.030 --> 03:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
adopters and who just like technology or
 
03:57:49.130 --> 03:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
want to be able to have access to that
 
03:57:51.950 --> 03:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
information if they were able to invest
 
03:57:55.010 --> 03:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
in that technology which is a relatively
 
03:57:57.349 --> 03:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
small cost for a homeowner
 
03:58:00.590 --> 03:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
in advance of a major migration then we
 
03:58:03.050 --> 03:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
would be upgrading the technology by
 
03:58:06.530 --> 03:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
people's opting in basically and so the
 
03:58:09.769 --> 03:58:09.779 align:start position:0%
idea is not to wait for a mandate that
 
03:58:11.330 --> 03:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
we're moving everything
 
03:58:13.550 --> 03:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
which will be expensive and a cost shift
 
03:58:15.769 --> 03:58:15.779 align:start position:0%
but to at least make the technology
 
03:58:19.370 --> 03:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
which is now available out there uh
 
03:58:20.809 --> 03:58:20.819 align:start position:0%
something that's promoted through the
 
03:58:22.969 --> 03:58:22.979 align:start position:0%
utilities so that people can opt in if
 
03:58:28.490 --> 03:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:30.050 --> 03:58:30.060 align:start position:0%
further comments representative
 
03:58:32.269 --> 03:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I'm just wondering uh if
 
03:58:34.070 --> 03:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
the representative from eversource would
 
03:58:39.250 --> 03:58:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:42.170 --> 03:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
eversource did testify in opposition to
 
03:58:44.090 --> 03:58:44.100 align:start position:0%
this bill originally
 
03:58:47.050 --> 03:58:47.060 align:start position:0%
representative closure thank you chair
 
03:58:49.729 --> 03:58:49.739 align:start position:0%
there's there is also groups out there
 
03:58:52.309 --> 03:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
that do not like these smart meters we
 
03:58:54.349 --> 03:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
hear of them they're worried about their
 
03:58:58.189 --> 03:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
EMF output so I would like to not
 
03:59:01.610 --> 03:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
advance hitzel itl
 
03:59:04.189 --> 03:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
other thoughts representative Thomas
 
03:59:06.650 --> 03:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
03:59:06.660 --> 03:59:07.309 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas thank you Mr chair
um

03:59:07.309 --> 03:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:10.849 --> 03:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
well I I I do agree with the intent of
 
03:59:12.889 --> 03:59:12.899 align:start position:0%
the voluntary nature of this bill which
 
03:59:15.590 --> 03:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
I think is uh more of my liking in that
 
03:59:17.809 --> 03:59:17.819 align:start position:0%
respect I still think that this bill
 
03:59:19.670 --> 03:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
would be premature because there's
 
03:59:21.410 --> 03:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
really nothing out there yet and the
 
03:59:23.630 --> 03:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
utilities certainly aren't proposing one
 
03:59:25.969 --> 03:59:25.979 align:start position:0%
yet and then we run a risk of someone
 
03:59:28.550 --> 03:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
buying a few people buying something now
 
03:59:30.830 --> 03:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
we're maybe in two or three years it's
 
03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
surpassed by different technology so I I
 
03:59:36.650 --> 03:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
think it's a little premature in in that
 
03:59:38.630 --> 03:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
respect although the voluntary nature of
 
03:59:43.010 --> 03:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:47.689 --> 03:59:47.699 align:start position:0%
representative partial thank you sure
 
03:59:49.790 --> 03:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
I think we already have had an
 
03:59:52.729 --> 03:59:52.739 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in on uh on the
 
03:59:54.950 --> 03:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
local magnetic output of these smart
 
03:59:56.570 --> 03:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
meters where the build was came up
 
03:59:58.429 --> 03:59:58.439 align:start position:0%
earlier we all decided that that was
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
insignificant so to bring it up now I
 
04:00:03.229 --> 04:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
find a little bit disingenuous
 
04:00:07.370 --> 04:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
I would also add that um I do not like
 
04:00:10.309 --> 04:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
the bill as written I think that we have
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
early uh innovators in the state such as
 
04:00:14.689 --> 04:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
unitel who've gone to Smart metering
 
04:00:16.910 --> 04:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
committed to it fully and they have
 
04:00:19.969 --> 04:00:19.979 align:start position:0%
actually created the software to have
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
time of day uh transactional
 
04:00:26.389 --> 04:00:26.399 align:start position:0%
time of use time time of use uh billing
 
04:00:28.670 --> 04:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
I think that has to be the wave of how
 
04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to modernize the Grid in
 
04:00:33.170 --> 04:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
order to flatten our demand line and
 
04:00:36.830 --> 04:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
flatten the Curve and to basically
 
04:00:39.469 --> 04:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of our electric car to
 
04:00:43.309 --> 04:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
our consumers I think the itl this is a
 
04:00:44.570 --> 04:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
bad move I think we ought to actually
 
04:00:46.790 --> 04:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
instead perhaps have a study committee
 
04:00:49.130 --> 04:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
on it it might not be the best Bill but
 
04:00:50.809 --> 04:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
I think it's a bill that certainly
 
04:00:52.490 --> 04:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
deserves our attention and can be
 
04:00:56.330 --> 04:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:58.610 --> 04:00:58.620 align:start position:0%
further comment representative Wendy
 
04:00:58.620 --> 04:00:59.570 align:start position:0%
further comment representative Wendy
Thomas

04:00:59.570 --> 04:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
Thomas
 
04:01:01.550 --> 04:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:01:04.429 --> 04:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
um just to talk about a statement you
 
04:01:06.469 --> 04:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
said we are a couple people have said
 
04:01:08.450 --> 04:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
about waiting for the utilities to make
 
04:01:11.750 --> 04:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
a decision there's no incentive for them
 
04:01:13.610 --> 04:01:13.620 align:start position:0%
to make an immediate decision and I
 
04:01:15.530 --> 04:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
think that part of our job is to light
 
04:01:18.650 --> 04:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
fires under them to force decisions for
 
04:01:22.910 --> 04:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:25.490 --> 04:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
so how does this bill do that I it's
 
04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
it's optional it's it's kind of
 
04:01:29.030 --> 04:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
independent of this bill it's just the
 
04:01:30.650 --> 04:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
the statements that were were made
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
around here
 
04:01:34.610 --> 04:01:34.620 align:start position:0%
um I mean I would like to see
 
04:01:36.830 --> 04:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
Smart Meters become available for those
 
04:01:39.530 --> 04:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
who want them the early adopters I would
 
04:01:42.469 --> 04:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:44.330 --> 04:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
but without some kind of a utility
 
04:01:46.849 --> 04:01:46.859 align:start position:0%
program to take advantage of the smart
 
04:01:50.030 --> 04:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
meter what does it buy you I right but
 
04:01:53.450 --> 04:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
but for us to wait for the utilities to
 
04:01:55.610 --> 04:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
tell us when they're ready to do it I
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
think that that's kind of backwards I
 
04:02:01.070 --> 04:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
think we should be demanding of the
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
utilities that that they they in
 
04:02:08.929 --> 04:02:08.939 align:start position:0%
put in this this kind of Technology
 
04:02:10.969 --> 04:02:10.979 align:start position:0%
we've been fighting a smart meter
 
04:02:14.330 --> 04:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
without a utility program to take
 
04:02:16.070 --> 04:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of it be like buying a
 
04:02:18.250 --> 04:02:18.260 align:start position:0%
computer with no software
 
04:02:21.889 --> 04:02:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:24.290 --> 04:02:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki uh thank you Mr
 
04:02:27.410 --> 04:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
chairman there are in my experience
 
04:02:29.090 --> 04:02:29.100 align:start position:0%
numerous ways that people can monitor
 
04:02:32.450 --> 04:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
their power usage real time other than
 
04:02:34.729 --> 04:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
using the meter itself you can have us
 
04:02:36.670 --> 04:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
some kind of current census on your
 
04:02:39.830 --> 04:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
wires whatever and I'm certain that such
 
04:02:41.570 --> 04:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
things exist and if somebody wants to do
 
04:02:43.130 --> 04:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
it then they can do that without any
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
privacy risks and without having to wait
 
04:02:49.010 --> 04:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:51.349 --> 04:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's true I'm at my utility New
 
04:02:53.389 --> 04:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Co-op offered me the
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to buy such a device I think
 
04:02:58.370 --> 04:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
it was 259 dollars
 
04:03:00.530 --> 04:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
and it would monitor all the appliances
 
04:03:02.330 --> 04:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
in my house and tell me
 
04:03:04.849 --> 04:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
what I was using representative McGee
 
04:03:06.590 --> 04:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to clarify because
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
the idea that only the utilities would
 
04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
be able to help you to
 
04:03:15.530 --> 04:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
use a Smart Meters output is inaccurate
 
04:03:17.809 --> 04:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
there are applications you can have on
 
04:03:19.429 --> 04:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
your phone that help you interact with
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
your meter and those can also be used by
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
groups like the community power you know
 
04:03:27.469 --> 04:03:27.479 align:start position:0%
we're starting to create a competitive
 
04:03:28.969 --> 04:03:28.979 align:start position:0%
market in New Hampshire having a smart
 
04:03:30.910 --> 04:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
meter is not
 
04:03:35.210 --> 04:03:35.220 align:start position:0%
only a utility for a customer maybe
 
04:03:38.090 --> 04:03:38.100 align:start position:0%
utilities of Runway but only helpful to
 
04:03:40.490 --> 04:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
a customer if they have a utility to
 
04:03:42.650 --> 04:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
interpret it for them I think
 
04:03:44.929 --> 04:03:44.939 align:start position:0%
the data is something that is not
 
04:03:47.809 --> 04:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
necessarily just going to be a construct
 
04:03:50.570 --> 04:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
of the utilities going forward so I
 
04:03:52.670 --> 04:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
think that's a misnomer to feel that you
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
can't use it if your utility isn't ready
 
04:03:56.689 --> 04:03:56.699 align:start position:0%
to help you read it
 
04:03:58.729 --> 04:03:58.739 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you left us hanging
 
04:04:04.189 --> 04:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
um did you buy the smart meter
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
say again you left us hanging
 
04:04:09.650 --> 04:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
did you buy the smart meter that was
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
proposed I did not okay thank you it was
 
04:04:15.650 --> 04:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
a good deal but I didn't buy it
 
04:04:18.290 --> 04:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
I don't really care how much electricity
 
04:04:21.769 --> 04:04:21.779 align:start position:0%
my refrigerator uses so
 
04:04:25.130 --> 04:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:28.849 --> 04:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
all right I don't sense a a strong uh
 
04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
desire here to form a subcommittee on
 
04:04:33.229 --> 04:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
this one so we'll just have to let this
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
one go as it will whenever we get to
 
04:04:37.610 --> 04:04:37.620 align:start position:0%
Executive session
 
04:04:40.610 --> 04:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
and with that we have gone through the
 
04:04:43.250 --> 04:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
entire list according to my notes we
 
04:04:45.410 --> 04:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
have formed three stub committees one
 
04:04:47.809 --> 04:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
for 159
 
04:04:49.790 --> 04:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
which consists of
 
04:04:52.849 --> 04:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
Bernardi McWilliams Wendy Thomas Summers
 
04:04:54.889 --> 04:04:54.899 align:start position:0%
and McGee
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
then we have formed another subcommittee
 
04:04:59.330 --> 04:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
for HB 558
 
04:05:01.790 --> 04:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
which is representative Doug Thomas
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas Tom closure
 
04:05:07.250 --> 04:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
and representative McGee
 
04:05:11.830 --> 04:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
and the last subcommittee is hb609
 
04:05:14.210 --> 04:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
Representatives Vos McGee Kaplan
 
04:05:17.090 --> 04:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
Harrington and Corman
 
04:05:19.790 --> 04:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
is that correct representative Doug
 
04:05:23.030 --> 04:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr I Mr chair I propose
 
04:05:25.729 --> 04:05:25.739 align:start position:0%
that uh whoever we get as our new
 
04:05:27.050 --> 04:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
Committee Member be put onto my
 
04:05:27.060 --> 04:05:28.729 align:start position:0%
Committee Member be put onto my
subcommittee

04:05:28.729 --> 04:05:28.739 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
04:05:28.739 --> 04:05:30.650 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
okay

04:05:30.650 --> 04:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
okay

if he is so willing I'm willing to
 
04:05:37.610 --> 04:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:39.710 --> 04:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
what's that representative Wendy Thomas
 
04:05:42.170 --> 04:05:42.180 align:start position:0%

naughter
 
04:05:52.130 --> 04:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
do you know when you're going to have
 
04:05:54.349 --> 04:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
these subcommittees
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
as I explained at the beginning of the
 
04:05:59.530 --> 04:05:59.540 align:start position:0%
session the subcommittee chairs will
 
04:06:02.150 --> 04:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
decide when to call a subcommittee
 
04:06:02.160 --> 04:06:03.110 align:start position:0%
decide when to call a subcommittee
meeting

04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:06:05.510 --> 04:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
being well aware of the fact that it has
 
04:06:08.510 --> 04:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
to be published in the calendar at least
 
04:06:11.990 --> 04:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
four days prior to the meeting so for
 
04:06:12.000 --> 04:06:13.070 align:start position:0%
four days prior to the meeting so for
example

04:06:13.070 --> 04:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:06:14.330 --> 04:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to have a meeting
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting next Monday as long
 
04:06:20.269 --> 04:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
as you got it into this week's calendar
 
04:06:24.410 --> 04:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:25.670 --> 04:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be up to the
 
04:06:27.469 --> 04:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chairs to schedule these
 
04:06:27.479 --> 04:06:28.370 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chairs to schedule these
meetings

04:06:28.370 --> 04:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:06:30.889 --> 04:06:30.899 align:start position:0%
working in conjunction with the members
 
04:06:33.889 --> 04:06:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:37.309 --> 04:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
that makes sense seem fair
 
04:06:37.319 --> 04:06:38.750 align:start position:0%
that makes sense seem fair
okay

04:06:38.750 --> 04:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:06:40.370 --> 04:06:40.380 align:start position:0%

study committee on assessing generation
 
04:06:58.250 --> 04:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:02.530 --> 04:07:02.540 align:start position:0%
uh four of us from uh st e

were are on the
 
04:07:09.410 --> 04:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
it's a commission to study the power
 
04:07:12.050 --> 04:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
generation as assessing
 
04:07:12.060 --> 04:07:12.950 align:start position:0%
generation as assessing
um

04:07:12.950 --> 04:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:16.550 --> 04:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
the chair pat abbromi
 
04:07:18.530 --> 04:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
looked at it and what he'd done the
 
04:07:20.030 --> 04:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
years before
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
and would like to extend this committee
 
04:07:27.469 --> 04:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
so we would have enough time to complete
 
04:07:29.570 --> 04:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
it right now it ends in I believe
 
04:07:29.580 --> 04:07:31.070 align:start position:0%
it right now it ends in I believe
November

04:07:54.050 --> 04:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:56.570 --> 04:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
renew this committee for another year

that was to 25 November 25.
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
um also in discussion
 
04:08:05.330 --> 04:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh renewing It Is by either adding as
 
04:08:09.410 --> 04:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
Amendment or using one of the itl bills
 
04:08:12.550 --> 04:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
to extend the study Commission
 
04:08:14.750 --> 04:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
in our discussion
 
04:08:17.570 --> 04:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
um representative munz
 
04:08:20.510 --> 04:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh recognize that there's four of us on
 
04:08:25.250 --> 04:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
St e on a commission that's really
 
04:08:29.090 --> 04:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
um assessing the value of these
 
04:08:32.450 --> 04:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
Generations there's not much
 
04:08:32.460 --> 04:08:34.070 align:start position:0%
Generations there's not much
um

04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:36.889 --> 04:08:36.899 align:start position:0%
power being talked about is just how do
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
we assess the infrastructure so
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
it was brought to us for I think we have
 
04:08:43.199 --> 04:08:45.650 align:start position:0%
it was brought to us for I think we have
a

04:08:45.650 --> 04:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:47.689 --> 04:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
agreement that
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
two would be enough from s t e you know
 
04:08:53.469 --> 04:08:53.479 align:start position:0%
four isn't Overkill there's a senate
 
04:08:56.990 --> 04:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
appointee and maybe ways and means I
 
04:08:58.210 --> 04:08:58.220 align:start position:0%
will let
 
04:09:01.849 --> 04:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
Mr bramy decide but
 
04:09:05.150 --> 04:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
I think we had a consension debt four
 
04:09:08.689 --> 04:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
from STNA is too much for the next
 
04:09:08.699 --> 04:09:10.429 align:start position:0%
from STNA is too much for the next
um

04:09:10.429 --> 04:09:10.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:14.150 --> 04:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
if we make a bill for extending it so
 
04:09:16.189 --> 04:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
that would be a change
 
04:09:18.650 --> 04:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
representative Gorman thank you Mr
 
04:09:20.870 --> 04:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah if I may just add on to
 
04:09:23.689 --> 04:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
what uh representative said the
 
04:09:25.610 --> 04:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
committee the commission as it currently
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
is constituted has five members of the
 
04:09:30.830 --> 04:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
house uh representative roachford from
 
04:09:33.590 --> 04:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means and then for from this
 
04:09:35.809 --> 04:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
committee Representatives Munns Summers
 
04:09:37.370 --> 04:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
poche and myself
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
and we what we're looking at is how to
 
04:09:43.729 --> 04:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
assess these properties for taxation
 
04:09:45.469 --> 04:09:45.479 align:start position:0%
and you know this is just not in the
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
Wheelhouse of of people from this
 
04:09:49.010 --> 04:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
committee it's in the Wheelhouse of
 
04:09:52.790 --> 04:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
people from Ways and Means so uh what
 
04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
what we're thinking is that if we do put
 
04:09:58.250 --> 04:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
through a bill to extend the life of
 
04:10:01.610 --> 04:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee to sometime in 2024
 
04:10:03.590 --> 04:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me not something commission to
 
04:10:07.630 --> 04:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
sometime in 2024 that the bill also
 
04:10:10.670 --> 04:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
recommend at least a certain number from
 
04:10:15.170 --> 04:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means so that uh the people who
 
04:10:17.929 --> 04:10:17.939 align:start position:0%
actually know how to deal with taxes are
 
04:10:20.210 --> 04:10:20.220 align:start position:0%
properly represented
 
04:10:22.189 --> 04:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
okay so let me ask the committee would
 
04:10:25.250 --> 04:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
you guys be open to the idea of creating
 
04:10:28.070 --> 04:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
an amendment to extend this assessment
 
04:10:32.090 --> 04:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
commission and modify its membership
 
04:10:35.210 --> 04:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
and using House Bill 458 which we were
 
04:10:36.830 --> 04:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
going to itl
 
04:10:39.950 --> 04:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
as the vehicle to do that
 
04:10:43.030 --> 04:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
so we could replace all of the text of
 
04:10:46.010 --> 04:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
458 including its title
 
04:10:48.769 --> 04:10:48.779 align:start position:0%
and extend the assessment commission's
 
04:10:50.570 --> 04:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
life until
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
November of 2024
 
04:10:56.510 --> 04:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
is that a long enough time
 
04:10:58.969 --> 04:10:58.979 align:start position:0%
it should be in theory
 
04:11:00.590 --> 04:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
in theory okay
 
04:11:02.510 --> 04:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
what do you think representative Doug
 
04:11:05.510 --> 04:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
Thomas yes but thank you Mr yeah I yes I
 
04:11:07.969 --> 04:11:07.979 align:start position:0%
agree and one major reason why I agree
 
04:11:10.610 --> 04:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
is because the four Representatives that
 
04:11:13.130 --> 04:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
are on this commission right now weren't
 
04:11:16.790 --> 04:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
here a few years ago when a similar tax
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
assessment bill came through our
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee for electric utilities and
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
although we did a value attempt during
 
04:11:25.910 --> 04:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
that one year we quickly advised when it
 
04:11:27.889 --> 04:11:27.899 align:start position:0%
came through again it needed to be go
 
04:11:30.229 --> 04:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
going somewhere else because as the
 
04:11:32.750 --> 04:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
gentleman stated we are not tax
 
04:11:35.150 --> 04:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
assessors and just because it has the
 
04:11:37.790 --> 04:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
word generator or utility or energy
 
04:11:40.010 --> 04:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean it it's it's in
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
the proper committee so I I really
 
04:11:45.290 --> 04:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
support an amendment to uh to make those
 
04:11:47.630 --> 04:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
changes because uh I don't want to go
 
04:11:49.130 --> 04:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
through this again because we're not tax
 
04:11:49.140 --> 04:11:51.710 align:start position:0%
through this again because we're not tax
assessors

04:11:51.710 --> 04:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah this this
 
04:11:56.689 --> 04:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
issue has been going on for I don't know
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
the 20 years I've been involved in the
 
04:12:00.170 --> 04:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
state house so if there's a chance they
 
04:12:01.550 --> 04:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
need a little bit more time to finish it
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
up let's finish it up and get it done so
 
04:12:06.290 --> 04:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
I strongly support giving the extra year
 
04:12:09.050 --> 04:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
further comments representative Munns
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I just wanted to to
 
04:12:13.130 --> 04:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
follow up and say that you know the
 
04:12:15.290 --> 04:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
reason for trying to do it with a bill
 
04:12:19.130 --> 04:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
that we are talking about right now is
 
04:12:20.929 --> 04:12:20.939 align:start position:0%
so that hopefully what we can do is get
 
04:12:22.550 --> 04:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
it expedited through the house through
 
04:12:24.769 --> 04:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
the Senate so that the amount of period
 
04:12:27.050 --> 04:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
that will lapse between when the
 
04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
commission expires on November 1st and
 
04:12:31.010 --> 04:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
it gets to start up again will be very
 
04:12:31.020 --> 04:12:33.950 align:start position:0%
it gets to start up again will be very
short

04:12:33.950 --> 04:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:35.570 --> 04:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
that's why an amendment
 
04:12:38.750 --> 04:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
would work correct
 
04:12:42.769 --> 04:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:45.469 --> 04:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will proceed that way
 
04:12:47.570 --> 04:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
could I ask representative Corman and
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
representative closure to work on said
 
04:12:50.399 --> 04:12:51.650 align:start position:0%
representative closure to work on said
Amendment

04:12:51.650 --> 04:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:12:54.110 --> 04:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
and send it to the committee as soon as
 
04:12:56.150 --> 04:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
you can get it prepared
 
04:12:58.370 --> 04:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
by OLS
 
04:13:00.050 --> 04:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
and you can certainly work with
 
04:13:02.330 --> 04:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
representative abrami to a former
 
04:13:04.490 --> 04:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
representative of brahmer II
 
04:13:07.309 --> 04:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
make sure you get it right
 
04:13:09.710 --> 04:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
okay any further business to come before
 
04:13:13.550 --> 04:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:15.830 --> 04:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none I think we're done adjourned
 
04:13:18.830 --> 04:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
for today and we'll see you soon take
 
04:13:18.840 --> 04:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
