hb 1151 is a bill that seeks to protect

second amendment rights and most

important of all

human lives
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
hb 1151 would ban the open carrying of
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
firearms within 100 feet of a protest
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
rally of march
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
for any first amendment related activity
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
that takes place on any public property
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
despite what you may have been told or
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
what you may soon hear
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
the right to self-defense is preserved
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
while the bill restricts open carry it
 
00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:26.150 align:start position:0%
while the bill restricts open carry it
protest

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
protest
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
it has a
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
specific exemption for concealed carry
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
so if being armed makes you feel safer
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
you can carry a weapon
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
but what you can't do is carry it out in
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
the open within a hundred feet of other
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
people expressing their first amendment
 
00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.670 align:start position:0%
people expressing their first amendment
rights

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
over the years our courts have
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
repeatedly ruled that it does not
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
violate the second amendment for
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
government to prohibit firearms at
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
currently seven states along with the

among these states are alabama and north

carolina
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
something worth noting is that there is
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
an important exemption exception that
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
was written into the bill at the
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
suggestion of the new hampshire

bill
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
so open carry would be allowed when the
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
primary purpose of the rally is to
 
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.430 align:start position:0%
primary purpose of the rally is to
support

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%

00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that hb 1151 is a
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
good faith attempt to better protect the
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%

first amendment activities
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
while also protecting their right to
 
00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.829 align:start position:0%
while also protecting their right to

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
to sit down
 
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.670 align:start position:0%
to sit down
so

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot to do today and we've
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
got an awful lot to do next week so
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to move this process
 
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.710 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to move this process
along

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
along
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
so having said that
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
i'm announcing the final speaker
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
i rise in support of the committee's
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
recommendation of index being to
 
00:39:03.599 --> 00:39:05.270 align:start position:0%
recommendation of index being to
legislate

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
just to clarify a few
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
points that have been raised
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
to threaten an individual is already a
 
00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:12.790 align:start position:0%
to threaten an individual is already a
crime

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
crime
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
an existing law in new hampshire if you
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
threaten an individual using a firearm
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
actually is an enhanced penalty and is a
 
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.950 align:start position:0%
actually is an enhanced penalty and is a
felony

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
felony
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
the problem with hp
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
1151 is that it's both with its
 
00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.430 align:start position:0%
1151 is that it's both with its
application

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
and enforcement creates confusion
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
amongst the general public because of
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
the overly broad terminology used in in
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
the drafting
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
the goal was to prevent a individual
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
from open carrying a firearm or
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
a deadly weapon which would include a
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
pocket knife
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
from being able to open carry that
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
within a hundred feet of any type of
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
first amendment demonstration that's
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
occurring on public property
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
there is no exception if you are
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
standing on private property so that
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
political demonstration does not
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be noticed it can be
 
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.390 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be noticed it can be
spontaneous

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
spontaneous
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
as long as you're a spectator which
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
means you're looking in the general
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
direction of this spontaneous
 
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.790 align:start position:0%
direction of this spontaneous
demonstration

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
demonstration
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
if you're open carrying a firearm on on
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
your front lawn if you're within 100
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
feet of that
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
you would be violating the law
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
and i would also point out that these
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
parades and marches and demonstrations
 
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.190 align:start position:0%
parades and marches and demonstrations
are

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
often mobile which means you may be
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
outside the radius of
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
100 feet but because the demonstration
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
is moving in your direction
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
you would then be violating the law by
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
simply standing there minding your own
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
business it would also
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
apply to an individual who's driving a
 
00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.510 align:start position:0%
apply to an individual who's driving a
vehicle

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
who doesn't even know that there's a
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
demonstration happening
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
there is an exception if you have a gun
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
rack in a pickup truck a pickup truck
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%

00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
you see my point
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
so i asked i asked everyone to

and if i know this bill not only
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%

00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
traffic from a suspected i p address
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
involves the customer
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
the request we heard about
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
about 40
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
about 40 40 a year come from internet
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
crimes units of state and local law
 
00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.109 align:start position:0%
crimes units of state and local law
enforcement

00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
if a carrier that receives a subpoena
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
matches an ip address to a customer it
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
notifies the ag's office
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
it also provides the customer
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
name and address the types of service
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
they purchase and billing records
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
at that point a search warrant can be
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
requested from the court for additional
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
information from the carrier that is not
 
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.670 align:start position:0%
information from the carrier that is not
available

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
under an administrative subpoena
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that under our
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
current process the most sensitive
 
00:58:24.799 --> 00:58:25.990 align:start position:0%
current process the most sensitive
information

00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
like websites visited email records
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
email content require additional
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
authorization from a judge
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
the two-step process does two things
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
first it allows the ag office to quickly
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
get information back from carriers about
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
a potential hit
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
this is critically
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
critically important in cases where
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
victimization of a child may be ongoing
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
and second it loops in a judge in order
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
to limit the flow of more sensitive
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
personal information by requiring a
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill search warrants may
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
go out to multiple carriers at first
 
00:59:06.559 --> 00:59:07.670 align:start position:0%
go out to multiple carriers at first
step

00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
step
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
this means the most sensitive personal
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
information which doesn't always include
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
criminal activity has the potential to
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
come back from more sources
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
more information from more sources means
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
a greater chance of non-criminal
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
information being seen and potentially
 
00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:27.990 align:start position:0%
information being seen and potentially
mishandled

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
is the current process if the current
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
process allows investigations of child
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
abuse images to be jump started and
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
quickly narrowed and targeted
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from ag's office that
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
the process is used extremely
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
selectively and serves a valuable
 
00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.309 align:start position:0%
selectively and serves a valuable
function

00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
we heard no testimony at all that the
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
current process is being abused
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
instead we heard this bill slows down
 
00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
these investigations and may also have
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences of gathering
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
personal information from innocent
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
parties that while not criminal could
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
prove unnecessary and potentially
 
01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.309 align:start position:0%
prove unnecessary and potentially
embarrassing

01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
embarrassing
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we're asking that you
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
vote against the art to pass motion so
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested by
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative roy members will take
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
their seats
 
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative roy
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
to speak for the committee report
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to start by apologizing for
 
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.750 align:start position:0%
i'd like to start by apologizing for
that

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
that table motion i was so excited to
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
get us out of here early i jumped the
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
gun on that
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
so on this bill
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
the citizens of new hampshire have
 
01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.789 align:start position:0%
the citizens of new hampshire have
spoken

01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
spoken
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
we just passed or the citizens just
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
passed a constitutional amendment that
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
would guarantee their privacy
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
all this bill does
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
is it pays attention to what the
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire just told us
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
they want
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
if a law enforcement agency wants your
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
information from a common carrier for a
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation they should have
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
to follow the same rules as if they
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to go into your house and search
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
your computer
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
they should have to get a search warrant
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
and it's not a high bar it's probable
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
cause in layman's terms more likely than
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
not they just have to show that it's
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
more likely than not that you committed
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
a crime and therefore they need your
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
telephone records
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
it's not hard
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
it would take them an hour to get a
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
search warrant properly executed
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
so all i'm asking and all we're asking
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
is that we listen to the people of new
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire who just voted
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
for privacy and protection in their
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
records and personal effects
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and i would ask you
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
sir roy has requested a division vote
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
members will be in their seats the chair
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative muse for a
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
if i know this bill has unintensive
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
consequences that
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
that i think we'd all like to avoid that
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
it could slow down attorney general's
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
investigations into
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
child sexual abuse images which is
 
01:02:44.079 --> 01:02:45.190 align:start position:0%
child sexual abuse images which is
probably

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
one of the most horrible crimes on our
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
on our books
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
if i know that if i also know that
 
01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.309 align:start position:0%
if i know that if i also know that
providing

01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
providing
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
all of the data
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
that would be required to properly
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
investigate a case like this
 
01:02:59.839 --> 01:03:00.829 align:start position:0%
investigate a case like this
in

01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
the first uh
 
01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.430 align:start position:0%
the first uh
in

01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
basically in the first group of data
 
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:07.990 align:start position:0%
basically in the first group of data
that

01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
that is shared could compromise uh
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
personal information that is not
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
criminal uh from people who are not
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
engaged in these activities
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
then would i press
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
the red button so another motion can be
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative burt for
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that law
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement went to the phone companies
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
43 times from 2018 to 2021 and got phone
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
records of new hampshire citizens
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
without a search warrant
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know law enforcement can
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
get a search warrant within
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
i guess that's an hour
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
i heard it was a little less with just a
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
phone call
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
and lastly mr speaker if i know one
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
search of a new hampshire citizen's
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
phone records without a valid search
 
01:04:09.839 --> 01:04:10.950 align:start position:0%
phone records without a valid search
warrant

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
is one too many in the live free or die
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%

the rsa concerning the use of deadly
force

01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
force
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
by a police officer
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
one it removes reasonably beliefs
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
from the rsa
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
because what a person reasonably
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
believes is subjective
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
it is the
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire attorney general and or
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
the courts that make the determination
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
of the reasonableness of the use of
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
deadly force
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
based on objective facts not subjective
 
01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.789 align:start position:0%
based on objective facts not subjective
beliefs

01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
beliefs
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
the other change to the rsa is that it
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
removes the words to affect an arrest
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
since we heard in testimony from new
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire law enforcement
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
that they would never
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
use deadly force simply to factor an
 
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.190 align:start position:0%

arrest
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
removing those words from the new
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire rsa should not affect the
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
actions of the police at all
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
on page 21 of the calendar
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
you will see that the majority blurb
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
states that house bill 1483
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
would prohibit
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
the use of deadly force by a police
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
officer when affecting an arrest when
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
the subject has committed or is
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
committing a felony involving the use of
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
force or violence
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
using a deadly weapon and attempting to

nowhere in house bill 1483
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
does it state in fact
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
such a prohibition
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 1483 does not prohibit the

or to defend others
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
house bill 1483 does not prohibit the

use of deadly force by a police officer
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
to prevent the escape of someone
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
committing a felony using force or
 
01:08:53.759 --> 01:08:54.870 align:start position:0%
committing a felony using force or

01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding what is said in the
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
majority blurb the reason you do not
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
hear anything about prohibition in house
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
bill 1483 is because the word doesn't
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
exist in the bill

thank you mr speaker i rise in support
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee's recommendation of nxp
 
01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate this bill hb
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
1483 would prohibit a police officer
 
01:09:38.799 --> 01:09:39.749 align:start position:0%
1483 would prohibit a police officer
from

01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
using deadly force in the process of
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
affecting an arrest when a a
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
suspect has
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
is using deadly uh using a deadly weapon
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
to help facilitate their escape
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
or as otherwise indicates that
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
that suspect is posing a
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
the only testimony that we heard
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
in support of hb
 
01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.830 align:start position:0%
in support of hb
1483

01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
1483
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
used an example of someone who stole
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
clothes from a department store and was
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
running away
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
and as that individual was running away
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
if the police were to shoot that person
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
in the back
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
that would they believe that that would
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
be legal under new hampshire law in fact
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
that it would be under the existing law
 
01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.270 align:start position:0%
that it would be under the existing law
today

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
that would be against the law
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
that would be excessive force
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
and that would be a crime
 
01:10:40.159 --> 01:10:41.350 align:start position:0%
and that would be a crime
therefore

01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
the rationale and the testimony
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
would not actually resolve the concerns
 
01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.110 align:start position:0%
would not actually resolve the concerns
raised

01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
raised
 
01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:51.910 align:start position:0%
raised
that

01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
in respect to
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
the police officers
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
who risked their lives to protect us and
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
and we we want to ask them to continue
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
however if someone is using a deadly
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
weapon trying to escape
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
we want to tell the same police officers
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
that they cannot use deadly force
 
01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.189 align:start position:0%
that they cannot use deadly force
themselves

01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
if a suspect is engaging in behavior
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
that would seriously endanger
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
human lives
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
and we expect a police officer now to
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
arrest that person
 
01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
however they would not be permitted to
 
01:11:30.159 --> 01:11:30.870 align:start position:0%
however they would not be permitted to
use

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%

01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
hb 1483 not only jeopardizes the safety
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
of police officers
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
it puts the general public's safety at
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
risk as well
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
because it prohibits it obstructs police
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
officers from doing their duty to try to
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
save us when we we are in a
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
so please join me
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%

the eyes have it and the committee
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%

act relative to prohibitions on carrying
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
a loaded firearm on a no hrv or
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
snowmobile considered the same report
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
the same with the recommendation that
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
the bill ought to pass
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative bradley
 
01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:57.550 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:59.590 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
for many years states like new hampshire
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
have banned the practice of allowing
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
allowing loaded weapons on atvs and
 
01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.110 align:start position:0%
allowing loaded weapons on atvs and
snowmobiles

01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
the rationale is if you've ever been
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
around guns and off-road vehicles you
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
know how bumpy the ride can get how an
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
accidental spill or collision is always
 
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
a risk
 
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
and how dangerous a loaded gun can be
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
when it's dropped or mishandled
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
currently in both new hampshire and
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
minnesota you may carry a firearm in an
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
atv or snowmobile if it's unloaded
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
in both states law enforcement officers
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
carrying weapons while on duty are
 
01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.430 align:start position:0%
carrying weapons while on duty are
exempt

01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
as they are in other states with similar
 
01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.750 align:start position:0%
as they are in other states with similar
laws

01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
laws
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
the idea isn't to inconvenience gun
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
owners it's to reduce the risk of a
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
preventable tragedy
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
what hb 1636 does is to invite tragedy
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
by making an exception for carrying
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
loaded pistols on atvs and snowmobiles
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
by anyone not prohibited by new
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire law from carrying a firearm
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
aside from adding an unwanted element of
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
extra risk you have to wonder how the
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
possibility of sharing the trails with
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
people carrying loaded weapons
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
is going to sit with many of the
 
01:14:17.679 --> 01:14:18.709 align:start position:0%
is going to sit with many of the
families

01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
from in-state and out-of-state who have
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
recently taken up off-roading and
 
01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.270 align:start position:0%
recently taken up off-roading and
snowmobiling

01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is this bill makes a
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
sport that many people in the north
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
country depend on for income less
 
01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.149 align:start position:0%
country depend on for income less
attractive

01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
attractive
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
to the very people whose interest and
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
engagement provide the best chance for
 
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
it to grow
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
the chair made a
 
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.110 align:start position:0%
the chair made a
mistake

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
we have two speaking for the committee
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
report one against i should have called
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative abramson before i did
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative bradley

um
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like a new new gig up here
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'm getting used to it so uh
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
i'm probably going to make an occasional
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
mistake but i hope everybody will
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration thank you
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%

motion on house bill 13 sorry 1636
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
relative to allowing people who have a

relative to allowing people who have a
ohrv

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
ohrv
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
to uh have a loaded firearm on firearm
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i've asked this question a number of
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
times and i still have not gotten a
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
response what happens if somebody's out
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
in the woods
 
01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
out in the winter out in the snow and
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
they have their firearm with them and
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
it's loaded and they need to get home
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
is is the requirement that they have to
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
throw their their
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
firearm onto the trail into the snow
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
do they have to unload the weapon do
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
they have to pull the bolt or the slide
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
back and eject the cartridge into the
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
snow and lose it
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
and i i felt that this was a safety
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
people out there who are miles away from
 
01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.709 align:start position:0%
people out there who are miles away from
anyone

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
and having to leave either
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
firearms or ammunition on the trail so
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
for that reason i
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
am in support of this bill and i'm
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative burt has requested roll
 
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:34.870 align:start position:0%
representative burt has requested roll
call

01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
call
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
he is the final speaker so members take
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
your seats this will be a roll call vote
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
if it's sufficiently seconded
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
i would assume it will be
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded so this will
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's a housekeeping bill
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
what it does is we have constitutional
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
carry in new hampshire
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
when constitutional carry was passed
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
law that
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
nobody knew was sitting there in fish
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
and game that said if you
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
are riding a snowmobile or a four
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
wheeler you cannot carry a loaded
 
01:17:31.679 --> 01:17:34.630 align:start position:0%
wheeler you cannot carry a loaded
firearm

01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
the ag would like to have this language
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
cleaned up
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple ways to do it
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
repeal constitutional carry no
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
or repeal this small bill
 
01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.590 align:start position:0%
or repeal this small bill
yes

01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
one thing that's very important

do not have the power to serve as an
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
appeal board as per rsa nor do they want

that power
 
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:41.600 align:start position:0%

where commissioners may not have that
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
luxury would i now press the red button

so that another motion may be brought
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
know that at its heart this bill is a
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
due process bill that protects our
 
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
citizens here in new hampshire and mr
 
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
speaker if i know this bill does two
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
things the first of which
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
sets a timeline that the department must
 
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
respond to a citizen's request as the
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
current law would let them just hold the
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
request forever and never respond and mr
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
speaker if i know the second thing this
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
does is creates an appeal process so if
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
the citizen does not agree with the
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
department it can go to the commission
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
and appeal the decision of the
 
01:42:40.149 --> 01:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
department to the fish and game
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
commission which sets policy for the
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
fish and game department would i now
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
push the green button so the citizens
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
can have fair access to the fish and
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
game appeal process
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the ought to
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
pass as amended report majority report
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1299
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote if you're in
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
favor you'll press the green button if
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
you're opposed you'll press the red

thank you mr speaker
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
hb 1126 will allow adolescents 16 years

consent
 
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
there are many parents who beset by

substance use or other significant life
issues

01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
are rendered unable to provide adequate
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%

children
 
01:45:33.189 --> 01:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this means that some new
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire children
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
suffer chronic passive neglect
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
others end up homeless and subsisting on
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire statutes already provide
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
for consent to diagnosis and treatment
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
of stds and substance use disorder at 14
 
01:45:53.590 --> 01:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
and 12 years of age respectively
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
many states at the age of consent for
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
various kinds of health care at 16 or
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
even younger
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
currently minors while able to consent
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
to sexual activity prior to 18 years of
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%

human
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
papilloma virus vaccines without parent
 
01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:13.430 align:start position:0%
papilloma virus vaccines without parent
consent

01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
we know that the hpv vaccine is highly
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
effective in preventing cervical cancer
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
but only if received prior to exposure
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
to the virus
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
prior to the adolescent becoming
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
sexually active
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
as with so many issues there are
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
benefits and consequences on both sides
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
of this equation
 
01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
parents we know have rights
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
but in the end successful parenting
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
involves a contract of caring and
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
communication with their children
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
parents who afford strong family bonds
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
will lose nothing with this legislation
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
their adolescent children will be eager
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
or at least willing to discuss what is
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
best for their health
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
while conceding that there are
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
legitimate arguments to be made on both
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
sides the minority believes that
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
allowing 16 year olds to consent to
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
vaccines is a measured and reasonable
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
change in statute that will increase
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
access to essential preventative health
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
care for a vulnerable population
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
if you believe that we have a
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility to protect the health of
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
those without responsible and capable
 
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
adults in their lives if you believe

thank you mr speaker
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
as a freshman legislature
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
i have been learning how legislation can
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
create laws for a few
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
that then affect many
 
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
also i have often seen where we create
 
01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
bills that try to solve symptoms and not
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
the root cause of a problem
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 1126 is one of those bills
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
you will hear that and you have heard
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to give 16 year olds the
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
choice to vaccinate or not because they
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
are from a family that does not provide
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
adequate structure
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
for the child to make informed choices
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
for them
 
01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
these kids can end up homeless or
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
otherwise living on their own
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
my heart breaks for these kids
 
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
living through these tough situations
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
but to make a law enabling them to
 
01:48:46.709 --> 01:48:46.719 align:start position:0%
vaccinate or not
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
make a choice to vaccinate or not is not
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
good for these kids
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
whose parents are involved with
 
01:48:53.199 --> 01:48:54.550 align:start position:0%
whose parents are involved with
understanding

01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
is i'm sorry is not good for those kids
 
01:48:59.350 --> 01:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
whose parents are involved with
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
understanding the adverse effects that
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes arise after a vaccination
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
you will also hear that we have other
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
laws allowing minors the ability to make
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
choices without parental assistance
 
01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719 align:start position:0%
although this is true it does not mean
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
that it's right in this situation
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
in my opinion the root cause behind the
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
need this bill addresses is related to
 
01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:23.669 align:start position:0%
need this bill addresses is related to
breakdown

01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
breakdown
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
related to the breakdown of the family
 
01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:26.870 align:start position:0%
related to the breakdown of the family
unit

01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
we as parents accept the responsibility
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
of researching the risk reward behind
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
the decisions we make for our kids
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
most kids are not ready or capable of
 
01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:38.639 align:start position:0%
making tough decisions like vaccinating
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
me personally i have four kids
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
a daughter our oldest followed by three
 
01:49:45.199 --> 01:49:46.629 align:start position:0%
a daughter our oldest followed by three
boys

01:49:46.629 --> 01:49:46.639 align:start position:0%
boys
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
i am proud of all of them and they are
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
good kids
 
01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:50.950 align:start position:0%
good kids
however

01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
as for making complex decisions with
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
dire consequences
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
i would not allow them all to make a
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
choice to vaccinate before the age of
 
01:49:59.679 --> 01:50:01.109 align:start position:0%
choice to vaccinate before the age of
18.

01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
18.
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
my daughter is bright
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
mature and well researched when she
 
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
makes a decision
 
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
she has been this way from a very young
 
01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:11.270 align:start position:0%
she has been this way from a very young
age

01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
age
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
the boys on the other hand
 
01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:15.589 align:start position:0%
the boys on the other hand
well

01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
in their defense they have become bright
 
01:50:20.639 --> 01:50:21.669 align:start position:0%
in their defense they have become bright
mature

01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
mature
 
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
and sort of well-read
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
researched today
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
but it happened long after they turned
 
01:50:30.629 --> 01:50:30.639 align:start position:0%
after the age of 16.
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
we need to help these kids without
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
responsible parents in adequate
 
01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
structure but allowing them to make
 
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
their own decisions about vaccines
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
vaccinations is not the appropriate way
 
01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:42.159 align:start position:0%

01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
act relating to registers of probate
 
01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
providing that eliminating the officer
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
registration probate and all the
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
references to such office have been
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
considered the same report the same of
 
01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that the bill ought
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
to pass senator kurt walper from the
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
having considered the same and be
 
01:55:38.070 --> 01:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
enabled to agree with the majority
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
report with the following resolution
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
resolved that is inexpedient to
 
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
legislate senator timmy horrigan from
 
01:55:48.070 --> 01:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
this is a one-on-one debate the chair
 
01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:52.310 align:start position:0%
this is a one-on-one debate the chair
recognizes

01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
recognizes
 
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan to speak against
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
i've i've heard british thank you very
 
01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
much mr speaker
 
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
i guess first of all this will
 
01:56:15.589 --> 01:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
automatically be a division vote if i'm
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
not mistaken because we need to uh an
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
exact count of how many members are for
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
or against it because
 
01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:24.629 align:start position:0%
or against it because
um

01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
anyway this is a register of probate
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
you've all seen it down at the bottom of
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the ballot it's one of
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
those relatively little known county
 
01:56:33.119 --> 01:56:34.390 align:start position:0%
those relatively little known county
offices

01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
offices
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
it actually
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
gets as many as votes as the ones that
 
01:56:37.199 --> 01:56:38.229 align:start position:0%
gets as many as votes as the ones that
have

01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
more power and higher salaries so
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
actually they pay pretty generously 100
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
a year so they're doing
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
they're doing pretty well um
 
01:56:50.229 --> 01:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
my first first reason to vote against
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
the ought to pass is um this is a poorly
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
drafted resolution or bill or whatever
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
you want to call it it
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
only eliminates one of the two direct
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
references to the officers or register
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
of probate the constitution so it would
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
um it would still be
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
it would still the office would still
 
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
exist in the constitution even if this
 
01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:11.270 align:start position:0%
exist in the constitution even if this
passed

01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
also the
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
also any chr can't
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
can't automatically eliminate a
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
constitutional office such as a
 
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
registered probate
 
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
because there's many many references in
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
the statute law
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
to it and those would all remain in fact
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:27.669 align:start position:0%
i think
um

01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
i think i and i think as uh i had a i
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
got a phone call yesterday from
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
secretary bill garner he pointed out
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
that like even if
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
even if this passed they still have to
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
elect a registered probate because
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
there's also a statute law saying that
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
we have to elect a registered probate
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
and i think we should
 
01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
continue electing the registers of
 
01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:46.790 align:start position:0%
continue electing the registers of
probate

01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
probate
 
01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:47.589 align:start position:0%
probate
they

01:57:47.589 --> 01:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
they have a small but crucial function
 
01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
which is still worthwhile we've even
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
even strengthened it back in 2017 when
 
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:54.870 align:start position:0%
even strengthened it back in 2017 when
we

01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
passed the bill explicitly authorizing
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
them to work with the state archivist on
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
preserving historically
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
significant probate records and i also
 
01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:04.870 align:start position:0%
significant probate records and i also
think

01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
we need to look at some point in
 
01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
expanding the role of the registers of
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
probate because um
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
they have a role
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
they had a role that was like that
 
01:58:17.669 --> 01:58:17.679 align:start position:0%
was not entirely judiciary so like
 
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
replacing the resolutions of probate
 
01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
with just the circuit court clerks i
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
think was not a good idea even though
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
the probate division works great and
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
they have made a lot of good changes so
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
restoring the registers of probate in
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
the future would uh would make the
 
01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:33.589 align:start position:0%
the future would uh would make the
probate

01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
probate
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
chords and its function even better but
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the in the meantime
 
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
meantime i urge my colleagues please
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
please do not take this
 
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
remove the one reference
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
of the two references to the register
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
probate let's leave this part of the
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
constitution alone and let's
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
let's continue electing them i will say
 
01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
if you look at the vote counts it's
 
01:58:57.910 --> 01:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
comparable to those to the other county
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
offices and actually they have in many
 
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
cases elected some very talented people
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
to the position who take their job
 
01:59:05.589 --> 01:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
seriously so i think this job does have
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
value but the first thing to do is uh
 
01:59:12.070 --> 01:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
vote no on the ought to pass thanks
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.639 --> 01:59:17.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i just want to
 
01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
understand what you said the bill is
 
01:59:28.950 --> 01:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
flawed because we miss one section of
 
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
the constitution
 
01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
on the ballot that needs to go to the
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
people so they understand what they're
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
yes i believe you did get it right and
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you probably explain it more
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
clearly than i did but yes there's
 
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
two direct references to register a
 
01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
probate in the state constitution and
 
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
this one only eliminates i believe it's
 
01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
part one article 71 and they
 
01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
they're still mentioned in part two
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
article 81 and probably
 
01:59:56.400 --> 01:59:57.510 align:start position:0%
article 81 and probably
probably

01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
there's a few indirect references and
 
02:00:00.870 --> 02:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
them also
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
we would have needed some statute well
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
anyway yes
 
02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
you're exactly right i thank the member
 
02:00:10.629 --> 02:00:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a division vote
 
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
members will take their seats
 
02:00:17.189 --> 02:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
the last speaker
 
02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:26.709 --> 02:00:26.719 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:00:28.470 --> 02:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
walper to speak in favor of the
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:34.550 --> 02:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
12 years ago we reformed the court
 
02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
system and moved the duties
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the register of probate
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
into the court system
 
02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
this has worked
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
wonderfully in our states the probate
 
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
system works far faster much more
 
02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:55.669 align:start position:0%
system works far faster much more
efficiently

02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
and with much fewer
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
difficulties now
 
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
than it has in the past
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
now this bill doesn't deal directly with
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
that because the registrar of probate
 
02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:07.589 align:start position:0%
that because the registrar of probate
office

02:01:07.589 --> 02:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
so for the past five election cycles
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
we have elected registers of probate
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
who get a check
 
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
they have no office space
 
02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
they have no phones they have no
 
02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:27.669 align:start position:0%
they have no phones they have no
duties

02:01:27.669 --> 02:01:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:30.070 --> 02:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i believe
 
02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
that it's time that we corrected that
 
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
anomaly in our constitution which is
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
what the register of probate really
 
02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
comes down to it's like the buggy whip
 
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
it's long past time
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
when it should go away
 
02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:45.270 align:start position:0%
when it should go away
so

02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:46.229 align:start position:0%
so
we

02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
initially and i was co-sponsor of a
 
02:01:51.189 --> 02:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
couple of these bills
 
02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
tried to restore
 
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
the duties to the registers of probate
 
02:01:59.669 --> 02:01:59.679 align:start position:0%
they failed miserably
 
02:01:59.679 --> 02:02:01.189 align:start position:0%
they failed miserably
miserably

02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
miserably
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
the costs the difficulty of doing it
 
02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
that was the complexity of trying to
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
establish a space and offices and things
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
like that just
 
02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
was beyond being done
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
so it's time that we
 
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
updated the
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
constitution to where we are today
 
02:02:28.229 --> 02:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a division vote the
 
02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
motion before us on cacr 21 is the
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
majority report about to pass
 
02:02:39.750 --> 02:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:58.639 --> 02:03:05.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
i haven't got a listed representative
 
02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:15.280 align:start position:0%

he may be recognized
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
just basically
 
02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
this this cacr it's unnecessary it
 
02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:24.950 align:start position:0%
this this cacr it's unnecessary it
doesn't

02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:03:28.229 --> 02:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
maybe i shouldn't have asked to do api
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
that that the office of register of
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
probate has some value if i if i also
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
know that this cacr is badly drafted and
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't even do what it sets out to do
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
when i then press the red button so an
 
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
alternative motion may be introduced
 
02:03:53.350 --> 02:03:53.360 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker if i know that the
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
founders anticipated
 
02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
that at times it would be appropriate to
 
02:04:06.550 --> 02:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
mend our constitution
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
that there is no longer a need for our
 
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
counties to elect registers of probate
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
that by that if i know by changing that
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
job over the years we have saved the
 
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:20.880 align:start position:0%

good morning
 
02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
i want to start by reading what the
 
02:13:50.390 --> 02:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
actual the
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
cacr would read all workers within this
 
02:13:55.750 --> 02:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
state shall have the right to join
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
a union
 
02:13:59.910 --> 02:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
first of all this is overly broad and
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
extremely poorly drafted
 
02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
number two it would allow the way it's
 
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
written anyone to join any union
 
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
so if i'm working at dunkin donuts can i
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
demand that i become a member of the

teamsters if i'm working at walmart can
 
02:14:14.159 --> 02:14:14.870 align:start position:0%
teamsters if i'm working at walmart can
i

02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
demand to become a member of the piper's
 
02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:19.750 align:start position:0%
demand to become a member of the piper's
local

02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
local
 
02:14:22.709 --> 02:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
pipefitters local not pipers
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
we had absolutely no one testify at our
 
02:14:27.189 --> 02:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
hearings stating that they had ever been
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
denied entry into a union where actually
 
02:14:33.990 --> 02:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
a union was certified and existed
 
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
the national labor relations act and the
 
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
railway labor act already address
 
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
what this again poorly drafted
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:49.030 --> 02:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
furthermore there's costs associated
 
02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
with putting this on the ballot that
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
every town city and
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
in our entire state would have to be uh
 
02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
would have to endure
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
by putting it on their ballots and
 
02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:00.629 align:start position:0%
by putting it on their ballots and
finally

02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
finally
 
02:15:02.229 --> 02:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
it simply does not belong in our
 
02:15:02.239 --> 02:15:03.750 align:start position:0%
it simply does not belong in our
constitution

02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:04.870 align:start position:0%
constitution
uh

02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire constitution
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
is a i would almost call a sacred
 
02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:11.990 align:start position:0%
is a i would almost call a sacred
document

02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
document
 
02:15:14.790 --> 02:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
and this certainly is unworthy of being
 
02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:22.870 --> 02:15:22.880 align:start position:0%

unknowable degree with the majority

report with the recommendation that the

bill ought to pass senate ivy bond for

the minority of the committee
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
one-on-one debate the chair recognizes
 
02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative reid to speak against the
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:44.230 --> 02:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
while i don't really have hope to
 
02:21:48.070 --> 02:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
overturn the committee recommendation i
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
did want to take the opportunity to
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
introduce the idea of this bill to the
 
02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:53.190 align:start position:0%
introduce the idea of this bill to the
house

02:21:53.190 --> 02:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
because i think it's a really powerful
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
idea to address two major crises that we
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
have in the state the first is the
 
02:22:01.750 --> 02:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
graying of new hampshire
 
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
where we cannot attract and keep young
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
people in this state and the second is
 
02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
the home the housing crisis which is the
 
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
predominant contributor to the first
 
02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:14.389 align:start position:0%
predominant contributor to the first
crisis

02:22:14.389 --> 02:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
property taxes are at the heart of the
 
02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:18.150 align:start position:0%
property taxes are at the heart of the
cause

02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
cause
 
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
i won't say of the entire housing crisis
 
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
but certainly for young people people in
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
transition elderly people
 
02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
property taxes are a regressive tax
 
02:22:29.510 --> 02:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
structure that penalize
 
02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
people out of an ability to just buy a
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
home a modest home something i think we
 
02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
should all be supportive of because we
 
02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
know increased homeownership increases
 
02:22:39.990 --> 02:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
all kinds of good outcomes for
 
02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.150 align:start position:0%
all kinds of good outcomes for
communities

02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
this bill would enable the voters who
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
already control how their taxes are
 
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
dealt with in their town they vote up
 
02:22:51.750 --> 02:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
their taxes if they want
 
02:22:54.070 --> 02:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
an extra fire engine for example they
 
02:22:55.990 --> 02:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
already are in control of their own
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
property taxes this bill would simply
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
allow them if they so want
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
to say we're going to provide a
 
02:23:05.670 --> 02:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
homestead exemption for people who have
 
02:23:07.670 --> 02:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
one modest home
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
according to
 
02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
an area median income that's already in
 
02:23:12.319 --> 02:23:13.110 align:start position:0%
an area median income that's already in
use

02:23:13.110 --> 02:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
by the new hampshire housing financial
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
authority financial authority
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
would just provide that exemption if
 
02:23:21.910 --> 02:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
they want
 
02:23:21.920 --> 02:23:24.070 align:start position:0%
they want
now

02:23:24.070 --> 02:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:25.030 align:start position:0%
now
their

02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
the town doesn't have to recuperate the
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
costs of that but if they chose to there
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
are a number of ways available to them
 
02:23:33.670 --> 02:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
to do that and if they chose to increase
 
02:23:35.830 --> 02:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
taxes i wanted to know when i was
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
working on this idea how much that tax
 
02:23:39.910 --> 02:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
would increase for the people who have a
 
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
second home people from out of state who
 
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
have a vacation home how much would
 
02:23:45.830 --> 02:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
their taxes increase if the town chose
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
to recuperate the cost of this exemption
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
on them and it turns out i worked with a
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
mathematician who's the chair of his
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
department at the college he teaches at
 
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
and it turns out because of how
 
02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
property assessments are distributed in
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
that increase on those people that are
 
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
out of state have second homes here
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
vacation homes is only eight percent not
 
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
eight points eight percent so if
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
someone's paying a hundred dollars in
 
02:24:12.790 --> 02:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
property taxes and this is their second
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
home a vacation home they would be
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
paying 108 and that would enable the
 
02:24:19.429 --> 02:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
half of that community because it's a
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
community by community number it would
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
enable the half of that community that
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
are younger
 
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
starting out in life
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
are in transition of some sort of life
 
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
transition who otherwise just are not
 
02:24:33.830 --> 02:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
able to buy a home to live in which i
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
think is a basic thing we all
 
02:24:38.309 --> 02:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
have a drive to have own a little home
 
02:24:39.910 --> 02:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
of our own
 
02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
that would enable that lower half to to
 
02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
have their own home for eight extra
 
02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:45.510 align:start position:0%
have their own home for eight extra
dollars

02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
so again i think that if the voters of a
 
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
town want to be able to do this want to
 
02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:51.349 align:start position:0%
town want to be able to do this want to
distribute

02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
distribute
 
02:24:54.150 --> 02:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
how taxes are placed on people and
 
02:24:57.030 --> 02:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
increa and allow this exemption to exist
 
02:24:59.590 --> 02:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
for people to qualify for they should be
 
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
able to vote for that
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
and um that's all i have to say thank
 
02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:09.030 align:start position:0%
and um that's all i have to say thank
you

02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
do you recognize
 
02:25:12.790 --> 02:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry does the member yield the
 
02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:19.030 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry does the member yield the
questions

02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and thank you
 
02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
02:25:30.309 --> 02:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
so if i understand the the purpose of
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
the bill so the bill would provide
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
an exemption to local property taxes
 
02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
so is there any restraint on people
 
02:25:42.309 --> 02:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
receiving the
 
02:25:44.150 --> 02:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
the discount the exemption on the
 
02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
property taxes from voting for more
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
spending that would drive taxes up on
 
02:25:49.359 --> 02:25:50.389 align:start position:0%
spending that would drive taxes up on
others

02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
others
 
02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry are you saying
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
would the voters be able to prevent
 
02:25:57.510 --> 02:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
extra spending that drives up taxes is
 
02:25:59.190 --> 02:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
that what you're asking no my my
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
question is so so let's say my community
 
02:26:03.429 --> 02:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
adopts this this program should have
 
02:26:05.429 --> 02:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
passed and i'm eligible for the
 
02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
exemption so now i'm getting this
 
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
exemption on my property taxes but is
 
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
there any control on me being able to
 
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
then go to the polls to to vote up
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
lots of other spending programs that
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
would raise the taxes on others but not
 
02:26:22.389 --> 02:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily on myself
 
02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's how our current voting
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
system works is people go and vote their
 
02:26:28.230 --> 02:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
interests at the polls whether that
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
increases taxes on others or them or
 
02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
neither or both
 
02:26:35.270 --> 02:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
so that would be no change
 
02:26:39.270 --> 02:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
chair recognized reference and sellers
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:52.430 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:26:52.430 --> 02:26:53.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
[Music]

02:26:53.510 --> 02:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:26:55.270 --> 02:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
if you notice the
 
02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:56.790 align:start position:0%
if you notice the
vote

02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
for municipal and county
 
02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
we try to be non-partisan
 
02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
and come up with a consensus anytime
 
02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:08.070 align:start position:0%
and come up with a consensus anytime
it's

02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:09.910 align:start position:0%
it's
possible

02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
so in this case
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
this particular bill
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
seeks to somewhat remedy the housing

02:27:32.070 --> 02:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
a decrease in assessment

for property taxes
 
02:27:37.990 --> 02:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
the qualification for that
 
02:27:39.670 --> 02:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:41.429 align:start position:0%
is that the
home

02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
has to
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
be less than the typical home
 
02:27:49.270 --> 02:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
in that community
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
the second qualification is the income
 
02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
for the occupants of that
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
have to be less than the typical
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
in the community
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
can you imagine
 
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:10.250 --> 02:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
in the case of
 
02:28:10.260 --> 02:28:11.750 align:start position:0%
in the case of

we all put income in various pots

we all put income in various pots
sometimes

02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
you can have a lot of income
 
02:28:39.190 --> 02:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't qualify as income
 
02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
for adjusted gross
 
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
02:28:46.150 --> 02:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
in my own case
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
i have far more
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
discretionary dollars
 
02:28:53.510 --> 02:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
than i did when i was young
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
but i might qualify for this
 
02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
so i ask you
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
do not pit
 
02:29:01.439 --> 02:29:02.550 align:start position:0%
do not pit

even though
 
02:29:13.349 --> 02:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
the goal
 
02:29:15.750 --> 02:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
might be
 
02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:18.550 align:start position:0%
might be
very

02:29:18.550 --> 02:29:18.560 align:start position:0%

02:29:45.750 --> 02:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
question before us
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
is the majority motion of itl on house
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
bill 1387
 
02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.190 --> 02:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
members be in your seats we have a
 
02:31:05.670 --> 02:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:05.680 --> 02:31:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a division vote
 
02:32:38.309 --> 02:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative van for
 
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
a parliamentary inquiry
 
02:32:44.950 --> 02:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
house will be in order members be in
 
02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:49.030 --> 02:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and thank you
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
members of the house if i know that our
 
02:32:54.469 --> 02:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
current system of property tax is unfair
 
02:32:57.510 --> 02:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
and inequitable and if i know that many
 
02:33:00.309 --> 02:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
states have a homestead exemption
 
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this is enabling
 
02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
legislation which would require the town
 
02:33:08.710 --> 02:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
which adopted it to consider all of the
 
02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
exemptions currently allowed and decide
 
02:33:14.550 --> 02:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
at that point which of them they wish to
 
02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:15.510 align:start position:0%
at that point which of them they wish to
keep

02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
keep
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
would i now press
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
the red button to overturn the
 
02:33:23.750 --> 02:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation to itl thank you
 
02:33:25.270 --> 02:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
i recognize representative dolan for
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:30.790 --> 02:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:33:32.790 --> 02:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
if i know this is a well-meaning bill
 
02:33:35.110 --> 02:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
that attempts to partially solve the
 
02:33:36.870 --> 02:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
hurdles that young people have when they
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
attempt to purchase housing
 
02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
and if i know the homestead provisions
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill

coming in to bring a couple items drop
 
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:00.720 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
first i would like to thank all that
 
02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
came to my aid at our last session
 
02:38:27.270 --> 02:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
i would name names but i would probably
 
02:38:28.630 --> 02:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
miss someone
 
02:38:30.630 --> 02:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
i've received a lot of messages as to
 
02:38:32.790 --> 02:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
who but they included people and
 
02:38:35.110 --> 02:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
certainly i didn't know
 
02:38:36.550 --> 02:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
and i also heard that there were two
 
02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:37.670 align:start position:0%
and i also heard that there were two
senators

02:38:37.670 --> 02:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
senators
 
02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:38.950 align:start position:0%
senators
involved

02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
involved
 
02:38:40.830 --> 02:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
i guess that if one had a medical
 
02:38:43.990 --> 02:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
emergency this would be the place
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
i've heard of cases where someone
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
collapsed in stores and people just
 
02:38:49.190 --> 02:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
walked around them knowing we have a lot
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
of nurses emts and even doctors here as
 
02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:53.349 align:start position:0%
of nurses emts and even doctors here as
reps

02:38:53.349 --> 02:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
reps
 
02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
this would be the place
 
02:38:57.510 --> 02:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
so i humbly thank you for being there
 
02:38:59.429 --> 02:38:59.439 align:start position:0%

with a unique place
 
04:14:01.110 --> 04:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
in american history it was new
 
04:14:03.030 --> 04:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire's adoption
 
04:14:05.110 --> 04:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
of the u.s constitution we were the
 
04:14:06.389 --> 04:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
ninth state
 
04:14:09.110 --> 04:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
to ratify the u.s constitution which was
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
the vote that made it official and sent
 
04:14:13.349 --> 04:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
it into effect
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
for all of the 13 colonies we did that
 
04:14:19.269 --> 04:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
it was this state it was new hampshire
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
that created the united states of
 
04:14:21.120 --> 04:14:23.990 align:start position:0%

fast forward a few decades
 
04:14:27.670 --> 04:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
we had a civil war
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
as a few breakaway states decided that
 
04:14:31.750 --> 04:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
they would rather go do their own thing
 
04:14:33.990 --> 04:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
and establish a country founded on the
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
principles of chattel slavery
 
04:14:37.910 --> 04:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
well new hampshire didn't think that was
 
04:14:39.670 --> 04:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
such a good idea so we answered
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
president lincoln's call
 
04:14:43.510 --> 04:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
that guy
 
04:14:45.510 --> 04:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
and we sent troops down to put a stop to
 
04:14:45.520 --> 04:14:46.870 align:start position:0%
and we sent troops down to put a stop to
that

04:14:46.870 --> 04:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
folks might not realize this but you
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
know when we walk into this building
 
04:14:52.149 --> 04:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
through the front foyer
 
04:14:53.510 --> 04:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
we come in through a room called the
 
04:14:56.149 --> 04:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
hall of flags
 
04:14:58.630 --> 04:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
the regimental battle standard
 
04:15:01.349 --> 04:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire regiment that
 
04:15:03.910 --> 04:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
liberated the confederate capital city
 
04:15:06.870 --> 04:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
of richmond virginia is downstairs on
 
04:15:09.429 --> 04:15:09.439 align:start position:0%
the first floor of this building
 
04:15:12.149 --> 04:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire liberated the confederate
 
04:15:12.159 --> 04:15:13.189 align:start position:0%
new hampshire liberated the confederate
capital

04:15:13.189 --> 04:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
capital
 
04:15:15.670 --> 04:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
and worked to it when jefferson davis
 
04:15:18.149 --> 04:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
and his little cohort ran fleeing with
 
04:15:20.389 --> 04:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
their tails between their legs they were
 
04:15:22.630 --> 04:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
running from new hampshire soldiers and
 
04:15:26.469 --> 04:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
i am proud of that heritage and legacy
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we all carry with us here in this
 
04:15:31.830 --> 04:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
chamber and every day that we carry on
 
04:15:34.149 --> 04:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
as an elected official in this state and
 
04:15:36.710 --> 04:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
all of this this transcends party this
 
04:15:39.349 --> 04:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
transcends ideology we are americans and
 
04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
we are from new hampshire
 
04:15:45.990 --> 04:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
fast forward a few more decades
 
04:15:47.349 --> 04:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
you know when i first got elected in
 
04:15:49.030 --> 04:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
2012 there were three things i
 
04:15:51.110 --> 04:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely never thought that i would
 
04:15:53.030 --> 04:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
vote on during my tenure in the new
 
04:15:54.950 --> 04:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire house
 
04:15:57.510 --> 04:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
articles of impeachment and we came
 
04:15:59.349 --> 04:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
close a couple of years ago we had a
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
bill called it was a bill of address it
 
04:16:02.469 --> 04:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
was the first step in an impeachment
 
04:16:05.189 --> 04:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
proceeding so there was number one
 
04:16:07.349 --> 04:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
number two was formal disciplinary
 
04:16:09.189 --> 04:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
actions against members of the house
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we had that a couple of
 
04:16:11.910 --> 04:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:16:13.670 --> 04:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
so that was number two and here we are
 
04:16:17.349 --> 04:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
with number three articles of secession
 
04:16:19.590 --> 04:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's almost impossible to
 
04:16:22.070 --> 04:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
even talk about this without breaking
 
04:16:24.149 --> 04:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
down i mean i apologize for my composure
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i am close to tears right now
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
because this is such a deeply personal
 
04:16:28.640 --> 04:16:29.590 align:start position:0%
because this is such a deeply personal
issue

04:16:29.590 --> 04:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:16:30.950 --> 04:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:16:32.950 --> 04:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
we have this legislation in front of us
 
04:16:35.189 --> 04:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
it is a bill to destroy the united
 
04:16:35.199 --> 04:16:36.149 align:start position:0%

04:16:38.229 --> 04:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
we stand in the shadow
 
04:16:40.830 --> 04:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
literally of abraham lincoln and george
 
04:16:43.110 --> 04:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
washington and we are considering
 
04:16:45.510 --> 04:16:45.520 align:start position:0%

04:16:45.520 --> 04:16:46.790 align:start position:0%
legislation to take a star off of that
flag

04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
flag
 
04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
every single one of us stood for the
 
04:16:50.149 --> 04:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
pledge of allegiance in national anthem
 
04:16:52.149 --> 04:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
this morning every single one of us took
 
04:16:54.309 --> 04:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
the same oath of office to support and
 
04:16:56.790 --> 04:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
defend the constitution united states
 
04:16:59.189 --> 04:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
and we have legislation now seeking to
 
04:17:01.349 --> 04:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
destroy the constitution of the united
 
04:17:04.469 --> 04:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
states that is beyond shameful it is
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
beyond disgraceful and it is a stain on
 
04:17:09.670 --> 04:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
the proud history of the state that we
 
04:17:11.910 --> 04:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
even have to entertain this being
 
04:17:13.510 --> 04:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
introduced through the administrative
 
04:17:16.469 --> 04:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
process never mind you know getting far
 
04:17:18.229 --> 04:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
enough along to have a vote on the floor
 
04:17:20.710 --> 04:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
of the house
 
04:17:23.429 --> 04:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
it was really close
 
04:17:26.149 --> 04:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
to the textbook definition under title
 
04:17:28.630 --> 04:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
18 of the us code
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
it was really close to the definition of
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
advocating overthrow of the u.s
 
04:17:32.399 --> 04:17:33.349 align:start position:0%
advocating overthrow of the u.s
government

04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
when the cacr was introduced
 
04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
when co-sponsors signed on
 
04:17:40.710 --> 04:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
it was really close to seditious
 
04:17:40.720 --> 04:17:42.309 align:start position:0%
it was really close to seditious
conspiracy

04:17:42.309 --> 04:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
conspiracy
 
04:17:43.910 --> 04:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
a vote for this
 
04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
is really close to the federal
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
definition of treason
 
04:17:52.149 --> 04:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:56.790 --> 04:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:58.710 --> 04:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
there's a member yield to questions
 
04:18:00.710 --> 04:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
member does not yield
 
04:18:03.670 --> 04:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes santa natastov to
 
04:18:08.790 --> 04:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:10.710 --> 04:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:18:12.070 --> 04:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
04:18:13.750 --> 04:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
the united states is not going to
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
outlast the sun one day it will end if
 
04:18:19.110 --> 04:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
you declared in 1985 that the soviet
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
union would be completely gone in the
 
04:18:22.550 --> 04:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
next decade you would be considered a
 
04:18:26.070 --> 04:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
crazy person but in 91 it was gone
 
04:18:28.550 --> 04:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
the american religion is the u s dollar
 
04:18:31.030 --> 04:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
our biggest export inflation
 
04:18:33.189 --> 04:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
few understand the privilege we have had
 
04:18:35.110 --> 04:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
to create money from nothing and export
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
our inflation living on the backs of the
 
04:18:39.269 --> 04:18:39.279 align:start position:0%
rest of the world
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
when the world stops subsidizing the
 
04:18:42.790 --> 04:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
dollar the federal government loses
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
ability to dictate the state's behavior
 
04:18:46.389 --> 04:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
unable to bribe them with worthless
 
04:18:48.550 --> 04:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
money and quickly the union will fall
 
04:18:48.560 --> 04:18:49.830 align:start position:0%
money and quickly the union will fall
apart

04:18:49.830 --> 04:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
apart
 
04:18:51.990 --> 04:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
this national divorce is going to happen
 
04:18:53.910 --> 04:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's inevitable and we have an
 
04:18:56.149 --> 04:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get ahead of it
 
04:18:58.750 --> 04:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
the historic motion cr
 
04:19:01.830 --> 04:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
cacr32 calls on for a vote by the new
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens on the question of
 
04:19:05.030 --> 04:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
state independence
 
04:19:06.950 --> 04:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
at the committee hearing many objections
 
04:19:08.469 --> 04:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
were raised all which were answered by
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
the pro-independent citizens who
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
testified and some which i'll address
 
04:19:14.469 --> 04:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
again today
 
04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
the biggest objection alleged is this
 
04:19:18.309 --> 04:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
whole effort is treasonous that any
 
04:19:20.070 --> 04:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
moves towards independence for any state
 
04:19:22.469 --> 04:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
is illegal and unconstitutional
 
04:19:24.149 --> 04:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
if it were unconstitutional for a state
 
04:19:26.229 --> 04:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
to secede this prohibition would have
 
04:19:28.229 --> 04:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
been included in the u.s in the original
 
04:19:29.990 --> 04:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
constitution for the 9th and 10th
 
04:19:32.309 --> 04:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
amendments since it's not specifically
 
04:19:33.750 --> 04:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
included there there is no such
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
restriction and that power is left to
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
the states
 
04:19:38.790 --> 04:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
additionally everything states are not
 
04:19:40.950 --> 04:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
permitted to do are listed in article 1
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
section 10 of the constitution it does
 
04:19:44.790 --> 04:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
not mention anything about separating
 
04:19:46.309 --> 04:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
from the union therefore it is not
 
04:19:46.319 --> 04:19:47.830 align:start position:0%
from the union therefore it is not
prohibited

04:19:47.830 --> 04:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
04:19:49.510 --> 04:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
and to those who say that per the
 
04:19:51.750 --> 04:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
articles of confederation this union is
 
04:19:54.070 --> 04:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
perpetual and that this concept was
 
04:19:56.229 --> 04:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
adopted by the u.s constitution
 
04:19:58.550 --> 04:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
we ask has there ever been in history a
 
04:20:01.269 --> 04:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
union that was undissolvable
 
04:20:02.950 --> 04:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
the federal government often supports
 
04:20:04.870 --> 04:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
independence movements in other nations
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
is the u.s the only perpetual nation in
 
04:20:08.149 --> 04:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
the history of the world
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
is there truly nothing the federal
 
04:20:10.950 --> 04:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
government could do that would allow a
 
04:20:13.990 --> 04:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
state to declare independence
 
04:20:15.269 --> 04:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
and even if this move towards
 
04:20:17.269 --> 04:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
independence is illegal or treasonous
 
04:20:19.030 --> 04:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
which i do not believe it to be
 
04:20:20.790 --> 04:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
it would be no more so than the one in
 
04:20:20.800 --> 04:20:22.309 align:start position:0%
it would be no more so than the one in
1776

04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
1776
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
which is celebrated by everybody in this
 
04:20:26.309 --> 04:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
body to quote from the declaration of
 
04:20:26.319 --> 04:20:27.590 align:start position:0%
body to quote from the declaration of
independence

04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
independence
 
04:20:29.189 --> 04:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
when in the course of human events it
 
04:20:31.030 --> 04:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
becomes necessary for one people to
 
04:20:33.030 --> 04:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
dissolve the political bands which have
 
04:20:34.710 --> 04:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
connected them with another and to
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
assume among the powers of the earth the
 
04:20:38.469 --> 04:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
separate and equal station to which the
 
04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
laws of nature and of nature's god
 
04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
entitle them a decent respect to the
 
04:20:44.710 --> 04:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
opinions of mankind requires that they
 
04:20:46.389 --> 04:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
should declare the causes which impel
 
04:20:48.070 --> 04:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
them to the separation
 
04:20:50.710 --> 04:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
we hold these truths to be self-evident
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
that all men are created equal and they
 
04:20:54.550 --> 04:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
are endowed by the creator with certain
 
04:20:56.710 --> 04:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
unanniable rights that among these are
 
04:20:58.469 --> 04:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
life liberty and the pursuit of
 
04:21:00.790 --> 04:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
happiness that to secure these rights
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
governments are instituted among men
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
deriving their powers from the consent
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
of the governed that whatever any form
 
04:21:07.990 --> 04:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
of government becomes destructive of
 
04:21:09.990 --> 04:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
these ends it is the right of the people
 
04:21:12.550 --> 04:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
to alter and or abolish it and to
 
04:21:14.309 --> 04:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
institute new government laying its
 
04:21:16.149 --> 04:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
foundation on such principles and
 
04:21:19.269 --> 04:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
organizing its powers in such form as to
 
04:21:20.950 --> 04:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
themselves seem the most likely to
 
04:21:22.630 --> 04:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
affect their safety and happiness
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
prudence indeed will dictate that
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
governments long established should not
 
04:21:27.910 --> 04:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
be changed for light and transient
 
04:21:30.550 --> 04:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
causes and accordingly all experience
 
04:21:32.790 --> 04:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
has shown that mankind are more disposed
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
to suffer
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
while suffer evils are sufferable than
 
04:21:37.590 --> 04:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
to write themselves by abolishing the
 
04:21:39.429 --> 04:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
forms to which they are accustomed but
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
when a long train of abusers and usurp
 
04:21:43.990 --> 04:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
patients pursuing invariably the same
 
04:21:46.469 --> 04:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
object invinces a design to reduce them
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
under absolute depth-ism it is their
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
right it is their duty to throw off such
 
04:21:52.710 --> 04:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
government and to promote and to provide
 
04:21:55.510 --> 04:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
new guards for their future security
 
04:21:57.269 --> 04:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
to assert that those who wrote this
 
04:21:59.189 --> 04:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
document went on to create a government
 
04:22:01.189 --> 04:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
that contradicts the principles on which
 
04:22:06.149 --> 04:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:07.830 --> 04:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
returning to the alleged violation of
 
04:22:09.750 --> 04:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
the constitution i'm surprised that some
 
04:22:11.349 --> 04:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
are troubled by violations of the u s
 
04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
constitution it is not even possible to
 
04:22:14.950 --> 04:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
list all the violations on the other
 
04:22:17.269 --> 04:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
part on the other party of this document
 
04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
making this contract void in the
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
perspective of any contract law that has
 
04:22:21.990 --> 04:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
ever existed
 
04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
there is no evidence that the federal
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
government is bound by the constitution
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
does our constitution allow an
 
04:22:28.870 --> 04:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
intelligence community which to quote
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
the current senate majority leader has
 
04:22:32.309 --> 04:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
six ways of sunday of getting back at
 
04:22:33.750 --> 04:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
you if you cross them
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
that work so hard to undermine the 45th
 
04:22:37.189 --> 04:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
president of this country and to assure
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
the election of our current president
 
04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
those who oppose this idea because in so
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
many words the civil war settled that
 
04:22:45.349 --> 04:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
issue we must assume that how the
 
04:22:47.910 --> 04:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
colonists lost the war in the 1700s that
 
04:22:49.030 --> 04:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
their words would not have been
 
04:22:50.950 --> 04:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
universally and everlasting true that
 
04:22:52.710 --> 04:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
their veracity depended upon winning a
 
04:22:52.720 --> 04:22:53.590 align:start position:0%
their veracity depended upon winning a
war

04:22:53.590 --> 04:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
war
 
04:22:55.590 --> 04:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
do we believe that other conquering
 
04:22:57.269 --> 04:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
nations have a right to forcefully rule
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
over the concord because might makes
 
04:23:02.149 --> 04:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
right for lack of power do we surrender
 
04:23:04.389 --> 04:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
the principle of self-determination for
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
a state any more or less than an
 
04:23:06.000 --> 04:23:08.070 align:start position:0%
a state any more or less than an
individual

04:23:08.070 --> 04:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
some oppose this because government's
 
04:23:10.950 --> 04:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
long established should not be changed
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
for light and transient causes
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
we are at a point beyond this does
 
04:23:16.149 --> 04:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
anyone believe that the current powers
 
04:23:17.590 --> 04:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
of the federal government over every
 
04:23:19.830 --> 04:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
aspect of our lives from toilets to
 
04:23:22.710 --> 04:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
light bulbs from taxing taxation to
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates from bankrupt social
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%

04:23:28.550 --> 04:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
deficit the war on drugs border patrols
 
04:23:30.550 --> 04:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
within 100 miles national borders how
 
04:23:31.990 --> 04:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
children are taught in our schools and
 
04:23:34.149 --> 04:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
arbitrary no-fly lists are just light
 
04:23:36.630 --> 04:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
and transient causes
 
04:23:38.550 --> 04:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
a federal government with approximately
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
400 agencies and more laws federal
 
04:23:42.070 --> 04:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
crimes and rules that anyone in the
 
04:23:43.990 --> 04:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
country is even aware of a federal
 
04:23:45.590 --> 04:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
government that has sent our sons and
 
04:23:46.870 --> 04:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
daughters to foreign countries and
 
04:23:48.389 --> 04:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
involved them in countless foreign
 
04:23:50.149 --> 04:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
entanglements often leading to their
 
04:23:50.159 --> 04:23:51.030 align:start position:0%
entanglements often leading to their
deaths

04:23:51.030 --> 04:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
04:23:52.469 --> 04:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
for those who label this effort
 
04:23:54.229 --> 04:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
unamerican referring back to the
 
04:23:56.469 --> 04:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
founding declaration of independence but
 
04:23:58.550 --> 04:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
when a train a long train of abuses and
 
04:24:00.550 --> 04:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
usurp patients pursuing invariably the
 
04:24:02.950 --> 04:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
same object invinces a design to reduce
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
them under absolute depth ism it is
 
04:24:07.110 --> 04:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
their right it is their duty to throw
 
04:24:08.710 --> 04:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
off such government
 
04:24:10.309 --> 04:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
how could one possibly argue that the
 
04:24:11.910 --> 04:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
words of the declaration of independence
 
04:24:14.309 --> 04:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
were un-american
 
04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
for concerns such as what is the plan or
 
04:24:18.309 --> 04:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
how we will survive there are plenty of
 
04:24:19.750 --> 04:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
examples of smaller countries in the
 
04:24:21.189 --> 04:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
world that function independently and
 
04:24:23.590 --> 04:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
even thrive but also it would be absurd
 
04:24:25.110 --> 04:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
to just tell a battered wife that she
 
04:24:28.229 --> 04:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
can't divorce until she has a plan
 
04:24:30.469 --> 04:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
this is not a fringe idea hashtag

national divorce trends on the internet
 
04:24:34.229 --> 04:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
there's a similar movement in california
 
04:24:35.349 --> 04:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
which will flourish again when
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
republicans take up take the u.s

there's independence movements in texas
 
04:24:42.550 --> 04:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
and several movements to move borders of
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%

stated
 
04:24:50.950 --> 04:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's time that every state that would
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
elect republicans to represent them and
 
04:24:54.550 --> 04:24:54.560 align:start position:0%

04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to live in yours

ben shapiro matt walsh temple and others

have spoken in support of splitting up

the union before it's too late
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
this bill has no one in the chamber
 
04:25:18.630 --> 04:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
voting directly on secession it asks
 
04:25:21.429 --> 04:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
them only to to allow those we purport
 
04:25:23.750 --> 04:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
to represent to make their own decisions
 
04:25:25.510 --> 04:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
if our state was currently independent
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
would we choose to join the union in the
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
situation that it's in
 
04:25:31.189 --> 04:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
the answer is obviously no so we should
 
04:25:33.189 --> 04:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
allow our citizens the opportunity to
 
04:25:35.349 --> 04:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
determine their own future
 
04:25:40.870 --> 04:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:44.070 --> 04:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order no

04:26:07.510 --> 04:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
no it was
 
04:26:10.229 --> 04:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:12.070 --> 04:26:12.080 align:start position:0%

have the right to resist soviet military
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
aggression right now

risked their lives and some of them died
 
04:27:08.389 --> 04:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
to end slavery not to subject us
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%

um succinct first let me say i'm amazed
 
04:28:09.670 --> 04:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
that i must speak as to why this is a
 
04:28:11.590 --> 04:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
bad idea not only logistically but
 
04:28:14.550 --> 04:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
constitutionally why this is impossible
 
04:28:15.990 --> 04:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
why it's improbable and why it's a
 
04:28:18.630 --> 04:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
violation of our oath to the u.s
 
04:28:20.550 --> 04:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
constitution into the state of new
 
04:28:23.189 --> 04:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire's constitution right
 
04:28:25.670 --> 04:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
i do not legislate based on hashtags i
 
04:28:26.870 --> 04:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
do not think we should either just
 
04:28:28.229 --> 04:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
because something is purportedly
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
trending which i'm not on twitter so
 
04:28:32.309 --> 04:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
i've never seen it right but let's be
 
04:28:33.670 --> 04:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
let's be honest let's be frank about
 
04:28:35.189 --> 04:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
what this is right now this is a
 
04:28:38.070 --> 04:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
historic moment not just in the state of
 
04:28:40.550 --> 04:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but it's a historic moment
 
04:28:42.790 --> 04:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
in america this is the first time a
 
04:28:44.309 --> 04:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
04:28:48.550 --> 04:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
has debated and will vote upon binding
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
binding secession
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
other secession movements that we've
 
04:28:54.710 --> 04:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
talked about many of those are
 
04:28:57.189 --> 04:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
non-binding they never get actual votes
 
04:28:59.349 --> 04:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
and debate on the floor this is binding
 
04:29:01.510 --> 04:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
it will be the first one debated since
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
prior to the civil war
 
04:29:05.429 --> 04:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
that's a historic moment that's also
 
04:29:07.990 --> 04:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
concerning that we're joining a very bad
 
04:29:10.790 --> 04:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
group of states that tried to overthrow
 
04:29:13.510 --> 04:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
the u.s constitution right that tried to
 
04:29:13.520 --> 04:29:14.710 align:start position:0%
the u.s constitution right that tried to
overthrow

04:29:14.710 --> 04:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
overthrow
 
04:29:17.349 --> 04:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
a a constitutionally elected in a
 
04:29:20.469 --> 04:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
constitutionally instituted government i
 
04:29:22.870 --> 04:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
do not think this body should join such
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
a group of states we should not be
 
04:29:26.630 --> 04:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
joining those former confederate states
 
04:29:29.670 --> 04:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
of america who were deemed treasons
 
04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
right i see right over my right hand
 
04:29:33.750 --> 04:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
shoulder here the man who beat back
 
04:29:36.309 --> 04:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
those who challenged our constitution
 
04:29:38.870 --> 04:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
and defended it right
 
04:29:40.710 --> 04:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
the most u.s service members that have
 
04:29:44.630 --> 04:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
died in any war was the civil war
 
04:29:46.469 --> 04:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
this body should not be proposing
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
legislation that could throw us into the
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
milestone of war
 
04:29:49.680 --> 04:29:50.710 align:start position:0%
milestone of war
right

04:29:50.710 --> 04:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:29:55.590 --> 04:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:57.189 --> 04:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
it's a terrible thing to do to our
 
04:29:58.870 --> 04:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
constituents a terrible thing to do to
 
04:30:01.269 --> 04:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
granite staters so
 
04:30:03.429 --> 04:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
let's let's also be clear about a number
 
04:30:04.710 --> 04:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
of other things when we discuss the
 
04:30:06.070 --> 04:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
constitution because i'm looking at this
 
04:30:08.229 --> 04:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
strictly from a constitutional issue
 
04:30:09.910 --> 04:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
right the federal government is the only
 
04:30:11.830 --> 04:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
legitimate power to admit new states and
 
04:30:14.229 --> 04:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
extend or attract territorial boundaries
 
04:30:16.469 --> 04:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
this is quite clear in article 4 section
 
04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
3 of our state constitution our state
 
04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
has never within its constitution and
 
04:30:21.510 --> 04:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
never has the federal government
 
04:30:23.189 --> 04:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
suggested that states can decide that
 
04:30:25.830 --> 04:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
they can leave or to join the government
 
04:30:27.670 --> 04:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
unless the federal government allows so
 
04:30:29.830 --> 04:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
right there is no process for leaving
 
04:30:32.229 --> 04:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
this union right the union
 
04:30:35.030 --> 04:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
as mentioned in texas versus white
 
04:30:35.040 --> 04:30:36.950 align:start position:0%
as mentioned in texas versus white
1869

04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
1869
 
04:30:40.920 --> 04:30:40.930 align:start position:0%
just chief justice salmon p chase
 
04:30:40.930 --> 04:30:42.229 align:start position:0%

explained

04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
explained
 
04:30:46.070 --> 04:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
in his majority decision a 9-0 decision
 
04:30:49.030 --> 04:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire native in fact same imp
 
04:30:50.950 --> 04:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
chase was but um
 
04:30:52.950 --> 04:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
that that
 
04:30:54.630 --> 04:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
he explained that the union began during
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
the revolutionary war amongst the
 
04:30:58.550 --> 04:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
colonies in his decision he writes quote
 
04:31:00.550 --> 04:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
we confirmed and strengthened and
 
04:31:00.560 --> 04:31:01.590 align:start position:0%
we confirmed and strengthened and
received

04:31:01.590 --> 04:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
received
 
04:31:03.429 --> 04:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
definite form and character and sanction
 
04:31:05.349 --> 04:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
from the articles of confederation and
 
04:31:07.590 --> 04:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
by these the union
 
04:31:10.149 --> 04:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
was solemnly declared to be perpetual
 
04:31:12.389 --> 04:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
right the articles of confederation of
 
04:31:14.870 --> 04:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
perpetual union that's the name of the
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
entire document our country was founded
 
04:31:19.590 --> 04:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
originally by that document we then
 
04:31:22.149 --> 04:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
chief justice chase then explains that
 
04:31:24.309 --> 04:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
the current constitution was ordained to
 
04:31:27.269 --> 04:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
form a more perfect union and i quote
 
04:31:29.590 --> 04:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
which extended to convey the idea of
 
04:31:32.630 --> 04:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
indissoluble unity therefore the union
 
04:31:35.510 --> 04:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
can never be dissolved anyone who thinks
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
and reports that they can dissolve the
 
04:31:39.750 --> 04:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
union single-handedly is wrong
 
04:31:39.760 --> 04:31:40.630 align:start position:0%
union single-handedly is wrong
right

04:31:40.630 --> 04:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:31:42.389 --> 04:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
let's also discuss the idea that this is
 
04:31:44.790 --> 04:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
a referendum this is no mere referendum
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has no referendum
 
04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
we have no state statute nothing in our
 
04:31:50.790 --> 04:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
state constitution that suggests that we
 
04:31:52.950 --> 04:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
have a referendum right we have a
 
04:31:55.110 --> 04:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional process for amending the
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
constitution i look at it this way
 
04:32:00.469 --> 04:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
this is a race right if you run a 5k
 
04:32:03.110 --> 04:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
you go each kilometer right kilometer
 
04:32:04.950 --> 04:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
one was the committee which by the way
 
04:32:06.790 --> 04:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
rejected this 21 to nothing recognizing
 
04:32:09.030 --> 04:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
it was unconstitutional in un-american
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
right step two is we go to the house
 
04:32:14.710 --> 04:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
floor and we vote on it right every step
 
04:32:16.149 --> 04:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
along the way that you continue to
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
complete this 5k is aiding and abetting
 
04:32:21.830 --> 04:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
and making this policy come to fruition
 
04:32:24.309 --> 04:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
right by bringing this to the people we
 
04:32:26.229 --> 04:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
are aiding and abetting in the process
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
of undermining the u.s constitution and
 
04:32:31.110 --> 04:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
violating our oaths of office right and
 
04:32:33.189 --> 04:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
i could go on regarding the 14th
 
04:32:35.670 --> 04:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
amendment in a myriad of you know this
 
04:32:37.590 --> 04:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
open question of what is rebellion which
 
04:32:39.429 --> 04:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
is not defined in the us constitution
 
04:32:41.269 --> 04:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
which quite frankly after this vote and
 
04:32:43.110 --> 04:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
now that it's roll called there is a
 
04:32:45.269 --> 04:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
question of what do we do and how do we
 
04:32:47.349 --> 04:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
enforce the 14th amendment which we took
 
04:32:49.510 --> 04:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
an oath to the constitution of
 
04:32:50.710 --> 04:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
and i hope
 
04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
i hope that we don't have to be
 
04:32:54.389 --> 04:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
answering that question on the house
 
04:32:56.950 --> 04:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
floor in the future i hope that everyone
 
04:32:59.030 --> 04:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
says no to this constitutional amendment
 
04:33:00.870 --> 04:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
because i would prefer not to see the
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
partisan politics of trying to remove
 
04:33:05.029 --> 04:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
members of this house for
 
04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
arguably maybe violating their
 
04:33:09.189 --> 04:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
constitutional oath right
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
it's deeply concerning to me
 
04:33:12.949 --> 04:33:12.959 align:start position:0%
and so i hope that we can reject this i
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
hope we can stick with constitutional
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
government i hope that we can uphold the
 
04:33:18.629 --> 04:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
u.s constitution i hope we can continue
 
04:33:19.830 --> 04:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
to uphold the new hampshire state
 
04:33:19.840 --> 04:33:22.709 align:start position:0%
to uphold the new hampshire state
constitution

04:33:22.709 --> 04:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:24.869 --> 04:33:24.879 align:start position:0%
we should support the union today
 
04:33:26.470 --> 04:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
the union tomorrow
 
04:33:28.230 --> 04:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
in the union forever
 
04:33:29.510 --> 04:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:33.670 --> 04:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:33.680 --> 04:33:34.551 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:33:36.310 --> 04:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
member yields
 
04:33:39.990 --> 04:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:41.670 --> 04:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you so much representative for
 
04:33:43.189 --> 04:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:33:45.429 --> 04:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
has have any of your colleagues decided
 
04:33:47.269 --> 04:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
on who's going to run for president of
 
04:33:52.789 --> 04:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:04.070 --> 04:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
we've had a request for a roll call
 
04:34:08.629 --> 04:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
and now i'm going to ask is that
 
04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded
 
04:34:12.869 --> 04:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded members will
 
04:34:15.189 --> 04:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
take their seats this will be a roll
 
04:34:33.670 --> 04:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:33.680 --> 04:35:15.429 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:35:15.429 --> 04:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
the question before us
 
04:35:23.310 --> 04:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
is the motion of itl on
 
04:35:26.789 --> 04:35:26.799 align:start position:0%
cacr32 this is a roll call vote
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:35:35.109 --> 04:35:35.119 align:start position:0%

several unintended consequences that
 
04:49:52.708 --> 04:49:52.718 align:start position:0%

an act exempting the display of a front

thank you mr speaker colleagues i rise
 
04:53:00.390 --> 04:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
against the committee report on hb 1138
 
04:53:03.190 --> 04:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
this bill would create a waiver system
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the requirement that vehicles have a
 
04:53:08.150 --> 04:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
numbered front license plate
 
04:53:10.628 --> 04:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
if it would alter the historic character
 
04:53:14.070 --> 04:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
the collectibility or devalue a vehicle
 
04:53:15.590 --> 04:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
the mounting of a front license plate
 
04:53:17.750 --> 04:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
can have a significant effect on the
 
04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
value of certain vehicles this is
 
04:53:22.390 --> 04:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
especially true for collectible cars
 
04:53:26.550 --> 04:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
higher-end sports cars imported vehicles
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
that do not have the same license plate
 
04:53:29.120 --> 04:53:30.070 align:start position:0%
that do not have the same license plate
shape

04:53:30.070 --> 04:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
shape
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
or area to be affixed on the front of
 
04:53:33.430 --> 04:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
the vehicle
 
04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
this bill would require exempted
 
04:53:37.110 --> 04:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles to display a decal sticker on
 
04:53:38.310 --> 04:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
the windshield
 
04:53:39.830 --> 04:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
so that the exemption would be known to
 
04:53:42.310 --> 04:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
04:53:44.470 --> 04:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
this would be similar to the inspection
 
04:53:45.990 --> 04:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
sticker that already goes on the
 
04:53:46.000 --> 04:53:48.070 align:start position:0%
sticker that already goes on the
windshield

04:53:48.070 --> 04:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
windshield
 
04:53:49.990 --> 04:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
many states already do not require a
 
04:53:52.230 --> 04:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
front license plate on vehicles
 
04:53:54.550 --> 04:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
those vehicles travel our roads
 
04:53:55.990 --> 04:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire permits cities and
 
04:53:58.310 --> 04:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
towns to issue commemorative license
 
04:54:00.868 --> 04:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
plates which may be displayed
 
04:54:03.510 --> 04:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
in lieu of a front license plate during
 
04:54:06.948 --> 04:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
an anniversary or other special event

today

04:54:18.868 --> 04:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:54:20.788 --> 04:54:20.798 align:start position:0%
i ask you would these plates be sold in
 
04:54:22.628 --> 04:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
the capital
 
04:54:24.868 --> 04:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
if there were safety issues issues with
 
04:54:27.190 --> 04:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
easy pass readers
 
04:54:28.868 --> 04:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
or any other concerns raised by the
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
majority the answer of course is no
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is completely voluntary it
 
04:54:37.110 --> 04:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
does not eliminate front license plates
 
04:54:38.948 --> 04:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
it is intended not to be a general
 
04:54:41.190 --> 04:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
exemption for everybody but for certain
 
04:54:43.830 --> 04:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles in certain circumstances if the
 
04:54:45.190 --> 04:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
owner of the vehicle
 
04:54:46.708 --> 04:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
follows a number of steps that are
 
04:54:49.030 --> 04:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
prescribed in the bill
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof is on the applicant
 
04:54:52.868 --> 04:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
and the bill requires
 
04:54:55.110 --> 04:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
they provide supporting information for
 
04:54:56.628 --> 04:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
their exemption request from a
 
04:54:58.550 --> 04:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
professional in the industry
 
04:55:01.510 --> 04:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
this is limited this is voluntary i ask
 
04:55:03.670 --> 04:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
that you vote no on the itl motion so
 
04:55:15.910 --> 04:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:18.310 --> 04:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
is a member yield to questions
 
04:55:25.030 --> 04:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:27.350 --> 04:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
so in the last snowstorm
 
04:55:29.430 --> 04:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
i was looking
 
04:55:31.110 --> 04:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
i was looking and i noticed that i
 
04:55:32.788 --> 04:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
couldn't see
 
04:55:35.590 --> 04:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
any or be able to read any front license
 
04:55:37.990 --> 04:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
plates because they were covered by snow
 
04:55:40.470 --> 04:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
and i could read all the rear license
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
plates so do you think
 
04:55:44.948 --> 04:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
that would be much different than having
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:52.708 --> 04:55:52.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:55:54.310 --> 04:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative there are circumstances
 
04:55:55.590 --> 04:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
like the one you described where the
 
04:55:59.830 --> 04:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:02.150 --> 04:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative crawford
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker house bill 1138
 
04:56:13.110 --> 04:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
would exempt the display of a front
 
04:56:15.990 --> 04:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
license plate on certain vehicles the
 
04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan majority of the committee
 
04:56:21.110 --> 04:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
agreed this this bill had many problems
 
04:56:23.590 --> 04:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement community testified
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
to the importance of vehicles having a
 
04:56:27.670 --> 04:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
front plate
 
04:56:30.150 --> 04:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding identifying vehicles for
 
04:56:32.788 --> 04:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
amber alerts bowler alerts and
 
04:56:35.830 --> 04:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
identification by witnesses and security
 
04:56:35.840 --> 04:56:36.948 align:start position:0%
identification by witnesses and security
cameras

04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
the dmv testified that the bill's
 
04:56:42.948 --> 04:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
wording would make it unenforceable
 
04:56:46.150 --> 04:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
due to the subjective nature of what is
 
04:56:47.590 --> 04:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
a valuable
 
04:56:50.868 --> 04:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
or collectible vehicle there would also
 
04:56:53.430 --> 04:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
be loss of revenue to the state
 
04:56:55.750 --> 04:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
because we still have toll booths that
 
04:56:58.230 --> 04:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
are equipped with front plate cameras
 
04:56:58.240 --> 04:56:59.270 align:start position:0%
are equipped with front plate cameras
only

04:56:59.270 --> 04:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:57:01.270 --> 04:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
for these reasons and more the committee
 
04:57:04.788 --> 04:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
voted 15 to 3 to itl this bill thank you
 
04:57:11.910 --> 04:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:13.910 --> 04:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the committee
 
04:57:15.750 --> 04:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
report been explaining to legislate on
 
04:57:20.948 --> 04:57:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:23.750 --> 04:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
04:57:25.990 --> 04:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested i was
 
04:57:30.390 --> 04:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
representative osborne has requested a
 
04:57:36.310 --> 04:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
roll call is that sufficiently seconded
 
04:57:38.230 --> 04:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
04:58:33.270 --> 04:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.190 --> 04:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
the motion before us the house will come
 
04:58:36.628 --> 04:58:36.638 align:start position:0%
to water
 
04:58:38.788 --> 04:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is inexpensive to
 
04:58:42.150 --> 04:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
legislate on house bill 1138 this is
 
04:58:46.230 --> 04:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:48.390 --> 04:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:58:53.430 --> 04:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:58:57.590 --> 04:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that mounting of a
 
04:59:00.150 --> 04:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
front license plate can have a negative
 
04:59:01.910 --> 04:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
and a significant negative impact on the
 
04:59:04.628 --> 04:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
collectibility the historic character or
 
04:59:07.030 --> 04:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
the value of certain rare vehicles
 
04:59:09.030 --> 04:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
and if i know that vehicles without
 
04:59:11.590 --> 04:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
front plates are already in our roads
 
04:59:14.230 --> 04:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
both out of state vehicles as well as
 
04:59:16.470 --> 04:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
many new hampshire cars
 
04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that the fears of
 
04:59:19.910 --> 04:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
police being unable to identify vehicles
 
04:59:22.550 --> 04:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
easily is unlikely to be a major problem
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
with unique distinct and rare vehicles
 
04:59:27.270 --> 04:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
that would take advantage of this
 
04:59:27.280 --> 04:59:28.628 align:start position:0%
that would take advantage of this
exemption

04:59:28.628 --> 04:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
04:59:31.670 --> 04:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that any new
 
04:59:33.830 --> 04:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire vehicle owner can go out and
 
04:59:36.150 --> 04:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
buy a commemorative plate
 
04:59:37.670 --> 04:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
for the front of the car that does not
 
04:59:40.470 --> 04:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
uniquely identify that vehicle today and
 
04:59:42.948 --> 04:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
legally drive with it then would i now
 
04:59:45.350 --> 04:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
press the red button so that another
 
04:59:47.030 --> 04:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
motion may be made
 
04:59:49.270 --> 04:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker joe recognizes
 
04:59:50.708 --> 04:59:50.718 align:start position:0%

04:59:55.590 --> 04:59:55.600 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
05:00:00.230 --> 05:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
if i know that this bill has a number of
 
05:00:03.030 --> 05:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
problems with ambiguous language poorly
 
05:00:05.670 --> 05:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
defined terms as well as open-ended
 
05:00:08.868 --> 05:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
questions on enforcement process and an
 
05:00:11.830 --> 05:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
interminable loss of toll revenues
 
05:00:13.590 --> 05:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
05:00:16.150 --> 05:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement testified strongly
 
05:00:17.910 --> 05:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
on the importance of front plates for
 
05:00:21.190 --> 05:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
amber alerts witness identification and
 
05:00:23.510 --> 05:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
other important public safety issues
 
05:00:26.230 --> 05:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
would i then press the green button and

passed sent over to the senate it was
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
relative to the right of an informed
 
05:02:47.750 --> 05:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
infant born alive to medically

appropriate reasonable care and
 
05:02:49.600 --> 05:02:50.708 align:start position:0%
appropriate reasonable care and
treatment

05:02:50.708 --> 05:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
05:02:52.230 --> 05:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
we sent that over
 
05:02:54.390 --> 05:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
with the intention of protecting life of
 
05:02:56.470 --> 05:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
infants born alive
 
05:02:58.470 --> 05:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
the senate took the bill
 
05:02:59.910 --> 05:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
and simply
 
05:03:02.070 --> 05:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
took out the entire text of the bill and
 
05:03:04.550 --> 05:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
replaced it with a study committee
 
05:03:04.560 --> 05:03:05.510 align:start position:0%
replaced it with a study committee
and

05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:07.990 --> 05:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's a type of issue where i'm not sure
 
05:03:09.670 --> 05:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
i think most people have their minds
 
05:03:10.628 --> 05:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
made up
 
05:03:13.670 --> 05:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's not a issue that requires study
 
05:03:16.150 --> 05:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
and i think we could non-concur with the
 
05:03:17.350 --> 05:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
bill and would recommend that we
 
05:03:17.360 --> 05:03:22.470 align:start position:0%
bill and would recommend that we
non-concur

05:03:22.470 --> 05:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:27.030 --> 05:03:27.040 align:start position:0%

new people and some older people with
 
05:04:15.110 --> 05:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
really bad memories i think i think what
 
05:04:17.430 --> 05:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
we're doing now is we received bills
 
05:04:19.590 --> 05:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
from the senate and were concurring or
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
non-concurring could you could you
 
05:04:23.670 --> 05:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
please explain this process to us so
 
05:04:26.070 --> 05:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
that the folks that don't really know
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
what we're doing right now have a better
 
05:04:27.680 --> 05:04:31.830 align:start position:0%
what we're doing right now have a better
clue

05:04:31.830 --> 05:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:34.150 --> 05:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
these these are house bills that were
 
05:04:36.070 --> 05:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate and they were
 
05:04:40.230 --> 05:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:42.070 --> 05:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
their house bills
 
05:04:43.830 --> 05:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
these are the ones
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%

05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
that's why the the chairman will get up
 
05:04:59.270 --> 05:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
and ask either to concur non-concur or
 
05:05:01.030 --> 05:05:01.040 align:start position:0%

05:05:10.470 --> 05:05:10.480 align:start position:0%

what reason does the member rise
 
05:05:19.190 --> 05:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
could i ask a further point of
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:26.708 --> 05:05:26.718 align:start position:0%

05:05:31.990 --> 05:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
benefit of anybody who is confused what
 
05:05:37.030 --> 05:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
if we non-concur
 
05:05:43.670 --> 05:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
we kill the bill if we concur
 
05:05:46.150 --> 05:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
we accept the senate amendment
 
05:05:47.990 --> 05:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
and pass the bill
 
05:05:50.070 --> 05:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
if we non-concur and go to committee a
 
05:05:50.080 --> 05:05:51.830 align:start position:0%
if we non-concur and go to committee a
conference

05:05:51.830 --> 05:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
conference
 
05:05:53.750 --> 05:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
we set up a committee conference and
 
05:05:55.510 --> 05:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully the senate agrees to a
 
05:05:57.990 --> 05:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee a conference and then the
 
05:06:00.070 --> 05:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
senate and house will sit down
 
05:06:01.910 --> 05:06:01.920 align:start position:0%

redistricting in new hampshire
 
05:09:12.788 --> 05:09:12.798 align:start position:0%

appointed to work on the maps
 
05:09:15.750 --> 05:09:15.760 align:start position:0%

committee
 
05:09:23.990 --> 05:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
now we're being asked to rubber stamp

the changes the senate made to house
 
05:09:25.600 --> 05:09:26.390 align:start position:0%
the changes the senate made to house

05:09:26.390 --> 05:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
maps
 
05:09:28.868 --> 05:09:28.878 align:start position:0%
without giving you or the public
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to hear about those
 
05:09:33.190 --> 05:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
changes or those proposals
 
05:09:34.550 --> 05:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
do the changes make sense for the
 
05:09:36.390 --> 05:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
communities that will be affected do
 
05:09:37.910 --> 05:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
they make sense for you do they make
 
05:09:40.868 --> 05:09:40.878 align:start position:0%
sense for your communities we don't know
 
05:09:42.868 --> 05:09:42.878 align:start position:0%
there are significant changes
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
therefore i urge the membership to vote
 
05:09:46.788 --> 05:09:46.798 align:start position:0%

05:09:59.990 --> 05:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:10:03.270 --> 05:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
hb 50 is before this body for a second
 
05:10:03.280 --> 05:10:04.390 align:start position:0%
hb 50 is before this body for a second
time

05:10:04.390 --> 05:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:10:08.390 --> 05:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
you have passed this bill previously
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
this bill deals with the apportionment
 
05:10:14.310 --> 05:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
that is required by the federal census
 
05:10:15.750 --> 05:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
and it deals with your state
 
05:10:17.910 --> 05:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative districts
 
05:10:20.788 --> 05:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
the senate did change it
 
05:10:22.628 --> 05:10:22.638 align:start position:0%
you've already heard here today that the
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
senate does that they change things
 
05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
occasionally that we send over
 
05:10:29.910 --> 05:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
and we often agree with them
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
in this particular case the changes that
 
05:10:35.350 --> 05:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
were made to the maps that you have
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
approved for the districts that will
 
05:10:41.990 --> 05:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
define who sits here next session
 
05:10:44.470 --> 05:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
were done at the request
 
05:10:47.350 --> 05:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
of certain members of the house
 
05:10:49.990 --> 05:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
they were done at the request of members
 
05:10:53.430 --> 05:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
of the house for reasons that this body
 
05:10:53.440 --> 05:10:54.470 align:start position:0%
of the house for reasons that this body
knew

05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
knew
 
05:10:57.030 --> 05:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
were going to happen after the vote we
 
05:10:59.510 --> 05:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
have already taken to pass the state
 
05:11:01.750 --> 05:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative maps
 
05:11:03.670 --> 05:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
the primary reason for the need for
 
05:11:07.270 --> 05:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
those changes is that we have cities
 
05:11:10.230 --> 05:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
and the wards in those cities also need
 
05:11:11.910 --> 05:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
to be redistricted
 
05:11:15.430 --> 05:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
and their timetable for doing that work
 
05:11:18.788 --> 05:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
is outside of the calendar we have to do
 
05:11:20.070 --> 05:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
our work
 
05:11:24.470 --> 05:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
and accordingly wards in cities changed
 
05:11:26.070 --> 05:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
so for example
 
05:11:28.310 --> 05:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
in hillsborough county where the
 
05:11:30.310 --> 05:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative from nashua just referred
 
05:11:33.830 --> 05:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
to changes that were made
 
05:11:36.150 --> 05:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
the major city in hillsborough county
 
05:11:38.150 --> 05:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
manchester the wards changed
 
05:11:40.390 --> 05:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
significantly enough that it required
 
05:11:42.708 --> 05:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
changes in abutting districts to
 
05:11:46.628 --> 05:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
continue to meet the requirement for
 
05:11:46.638 --> 05:11:47.670 align:start position:0%
continue to meet the requirement for
the

05:11:47.670 --> 05:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:11:50.708 --> 05:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
apportionment of population and to stay
 
05:11:53.910 --> 05:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
within an acceptable deviation
 
05:11:55.670 --> 05:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
in other counties where there were
 
05:11:58.948 --> 05:11:58.958 align:start position:0%
changes made it was to better comply
 
05:12:01.590 --> 05:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
with the constitutional requirement that
 
05:12:04.470 --> 05:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
provides that where possible we have as
 
05:12:07.110 --> 05:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
many single community-based districts
 
05:12:09.350 --> 05:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
with their own representatives and
 
05:12:11.190 --> 05:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
indeed with some of the changes in
 
05:12:13.750 --> 05:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
further reflection those changes were
 
05:12:15.510 --> 05:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
able to be made
 
05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
the changes that were made by the senate
 
05:12:20.628 --> 05:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
were requested by members of this body
 
05:12:21.670 --> 05:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
and they
 
05:12:23.510 --> 05:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
they make sense
 
05:12:25.670 --> 05:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
they meet the federal requirements and
 
05:12:28.470 --> 05:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
they continue to do the job that we will
 
05:12:30.070 --> 05:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
need to do for the citizens of new
 
05:12:33.350 --> 05:12:33.360 align:start position:0%

previously passed by this house deals
 
05:17:18.628 --> 05:17:18.638 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:17:21.430 --> 05:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
process for the parties to determine
 
05:17:24.150 --> 05:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
delegates to the state convention
 
05:17:26.390 --> 05:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
the changes made by the senate were
 
05:17:29.430 --> 05:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
requested by house members
 
05:17:32.310 --> 05:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
in regards to the fact that when the
 
05:17:35.110 --> 05:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
changes were done in this body
 
05:17:37.030 --> 05:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
there was a portion of the statute that
 
05:17:39.190 --> 05:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
was not changed there were actually two
 
05:17:41.590 --> 05:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
components to this how the delegates are
 
05:17:41.600 --> 05:17:43.270 align:start position:0%
components to this how the delegates are
determined

determined
 
05:17:45.030 --> 05:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
the delegates will be determined based
 
05:17:47.110 --> 05:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
on your representative maps but there's
 
05:17:49.750 --> 05:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
also an actual ballot form in the
 
05:17:51.670 --> 05:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
statute which was not included in the
 
05:17:53.910 --> 05:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
original bill so the senate at the
 
05:17:56.070 --> 05:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
request of the house has now included

calendar bill
 
05:22:06.628 --> 05:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr speaker i rise in
 
05:22:08.390 --> 05:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
opposition to the itl motion on this
 
05:22:08.400 --> 05:22:09.190 align:start position:0%
opposition to the itl motion on this
bill

05:22:09.190 --> 05:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:22:10.708 --> 05:22:10.718 align:start position:0%
the bill would effectively reduce the
 
05:22:13.110 --> 05:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
signatures needed for minor parties from
 
05:22:15.110 --> 05:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
over six thousand signatures to two
 
05:22:15.120 --> 05:22:16.548 align:start position:0%
over six thousand signatures to two
thousand

05:22:16.548 --> 05:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
05:22:18.310 --> 05:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
since the uh you need three thousand
 
05:22:19.750 --> 05:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
valid signatures fifteen hundred from
 
05:22:21.350 --> 05:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
each congressional district and that
 
05:22:22.948 --> 05:22:22.958 align:start position:0%
effectively means that all minor parties
 
05:22:24.868 --> 05:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
and independent candidates need
 
05:22:26.628 --> 05:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
uh to turn in over six thousand to be
 
05:22:29.590 --> 05:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
sure this would reduce that uh
 
05:22:32.548 --> 05:22:32.558 align:start position:0%
insane burden from 6 000 to just about 2
 
05:22:32.558 --> 05:22:33.430 align:start position:0%
insane burden from 6 000 to just about 2
000

05:22:33.430 --> 05:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
000
 
05:22:34.948 --> 05:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
these minor parties and indica
 
05:22:36.708 --> 05:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
independent candidates get on the ballot
 
05:22:36.718 --> 05:22:37.590 align:start position:0%
independent candidates get on the ballot
anyway

05:22:37.590 --> 05:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
05:22:39.910 --> 05:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
about 90 percent of the time
 
05:22:41.430 --> 05:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
minor parties
 
05:22:43.670 --> 05:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
in gathering signatures
 
05:22:45.270 --> 05:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
end up having to interact with between
 
05:22:48.070 --> 05:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
fifty and sixty thousand voters who ask
 
05:22:50.230 --> 05:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
why are we having to sign this and the
 
05:22:52.150 --> 05:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
minor party activists holding clipboard
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
always say
 
05:22:53.520 --> 05:22:55.030 align:start position:0%
always say
basically

05:22:55.030 --> 05:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:22:56.948 --> 05:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
the two parties block ballot access to
 
05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
minor parties and don't have to get any
 
05:23:00.230 --> 05:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
signatures themselves to get on the
 
05:23:02.310 --> 05:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
ballot and the voters almost always find
 
05:23:04.230 --> 05:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
that to be extremely unfair and is very
 
05:23:04.240 --> 05:23:06.230 align:start position:0%
that to be extremely unfair and is very
aggravating

05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
aggravating
 
05:23:06.240 --> 05:23:07.270 align:start position:0%
aggravating
requiring

05:23:07.270 --> 05:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
05:23:09.750 --> 05:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
interacting with 60 000 people to get
 
05:23:11.750 --> 05:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
signatures is dangerous in the age of
 
05:23:13.270 --> 05:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
coronavirus and who knows what it's
 
05:23:15.350 --> 05:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to evolve into or adapt to in the
 
05:23:17.510 --> 05:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
next election cycle
 
05:23:20.788 --> 05:23:20.798 align:start position:0%
and most states only require
 
05:23:22.548 --> 05:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
about one percent
 
05:23:25.430 --> 05:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
for ballot access or less so current law
 
05:23:27.190 --> 05:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
aggravates independent voters who
 
05:23:30.150 --> 05:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
support ballot access by a margin of
 
05:23:31.910 --> 05:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
three to one
 
05:23:33.590 --> 05:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
so please vote red so that we can
 
05:23:35.990 --> 05:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
overturn this and pass some version of
 
05:23:41.110 --> 05:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:42.548 --> 05:23:42.558 align:start position:0%

on without nomination papers
 
05:24:09.190 --> 05:24:09.200 align:start position:0%

this state to print the names on ballots
 
05:24:13.990 --> 05:24:14.000 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
05:33:17.750 --> 05:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
the e-verify system well let me start by
 
05:33:18.788 --> 05:33:18.798 align:start position:0%
saying this
 
05:33:20.390 --> 05:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
bill was
 
05:33:23.110 --> 05:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
voted itl by the labor committee twenty
 
05:33:24.150 --> 05:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
to one
 
05:33:27.430 --> 05:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
it is a strong bipartisan rejection of
 
05:33:29.510 --> 05:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
this the system
 
05:33:31.190 --> 05:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
the the committee felt that the
 
05:33:33.830 --> 05:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
testimony we received indicated there
 
05:33:36.788 --> 05:33:36.798 align:start position:0%
are still accuracy issues with the
 
05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
system and that
 
05:33:41.270 --> 05:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
some of the more complicated names
 
05:33:43.750 --> 05:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
especially ethnic names
 
05:33:45.030 --> 05:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
are sometimes
 
05:33:46.788 --> 05:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
missed by the system
 
05:33:49.270 --> 05:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
once a name is rejected
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
then that individual cannot work in new
 
05:33:51.840 --> 05:33:52.868 align:start position:0%
then that individual cannot work in new
hampshire

05:33:52.868 --> 05:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:33:54.788 --> 05:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
until the error is fixed and that
 
05:33:57.030 --> 05:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes takes weeks
 
05:33:57.040 --> 05:33:58.230 align:start position:0%
sometimes takes weeks
so

05:33:58.230 --> 05:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:00.150 --> 05:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
we believe that the i-9 system that's
 
05:34:01.750 --> 05:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
presently in case
 
05:34:03.190 --> 05:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
in in force
 
05:34:05.590 --> 05:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
is an effective system we believe this
 
05:34:08.548 --> 05:34:08.558 align:start position:0%
mandate on employers is unnecessary and
 
05:34:14.868 --> 05:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
