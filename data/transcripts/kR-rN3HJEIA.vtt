late informational item
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
i would like to add
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
language in there so that the paragraph
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
reads the committee requested the
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%

the number of students enrolled
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
then adding the language where the
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
students were from comma
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
if that district had a masked mandate
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
policy comma and and then
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
what what effect
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
um could i
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
excuse me um please use your microphones
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
set on yeah so would the senator please
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
consider adding uh just another couple
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
of words to say
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
and other demogra other student
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
demographics is available
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
if they're going to go into a detailed
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
review it'd be nice to know
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
everything we can about the the
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
population that is accepting these
 
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.870 align:start position:0%
population that is accepting these
grants

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
grants
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
the the reason i added this language in
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
is i asked the commissioner specifically
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
for those two things i didn't ask them
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
for other demographics i i had
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
offline so i don't think it would be a
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
senator morris
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
i this is only to record minutes so it
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
would be what was said publicly that day
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
if if you're going to have to keep it to
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
that yeah uh could you
 
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.190 align:start position:0%

mike kane down here
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
um just going forward since this is
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
being live streamed when a motion is um
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
made and seconded if you could just
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
announce the member making that motion
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
in that second because sometimes there's
 
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
multiple it'd be easier for the public
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
to follow okay thank you
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%

up close and personal
 
00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.830 align:start position:0%
up close and personal
because

00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
it is live streaming
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
the audi the live streaming audience to
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%

low
[Laughter]

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]

mic thank you thanks for being here um i
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
have questions on both the
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
the homeless part and the long-term care
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
part on the homeless
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
part um there's six million dollars in
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
total appropriated
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
it i couldn't tell how much of that was
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
for shelters but my question is how much
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
of that is for shelters and
 
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.590 align:start position:0%
of that is for shelters and
if

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
if our reimbursement for a night in a
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
shelter is eight dollars a day but the
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
cost is 47 a day
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
what will the impact of the part of the
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
6 million
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
dollars be and then i have a question if
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
i could about the long-term care
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
okay the blue red red button red button
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
i was pressing the green button sorry
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh senator thank you for that question
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
yes so uh these will be for shelters uh
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
it is a total six million dollars is for
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
the shelter community and it is
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
exclusively for their code related
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
expenses over the course of the last two
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
years we're using cares act fund for
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
these dollars
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
so uh we'll need to uh work with them
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
there's a list of eligible expenses
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
including things like hvac systems and
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
new new space
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
and configurations right down to
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
cleaning supplies
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
and so this is part of an effort to
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
get these funds out here before the
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
weather gets bad and have them put into
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
use prior to the end of the year
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
so so none of it is to increase shelter
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
rates that
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
hhs had
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
said to us they would
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
tell us by august or september
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
what their plan was to increase shelter
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
rates and
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
it's almost november this this because
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
we're using this from cares act we
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
needed to have it be something that
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
could apply prior to the end of the year
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
and so we extended the care the expense
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
program uh to be able to get some
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
resources to the shelters in
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
anticipation of the coming winter season
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
so none of this will increase our
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from eight dollars a day
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
no ma'am thank you and on the long-term
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
care the 11 and a half million
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
i'm um
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know
 
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.269 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know
um

00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
how how that number was arrived at
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
because it's my understanding that the
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
nursing homes were not
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
the discussion of
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
that appropriation so what is the impact
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
of this 11 and a half million
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
going to be on this really struggling
 
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.310 align:start position:0%
going to be on this really struggling
sector

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
sector
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to this is chase again
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
who's our deputy director at gopher and
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good question thank you
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
the answer for you hi senator can
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
everyone hear me okay happy to answer
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
the question um the number was arrived
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
at by taking the known long-term care
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
facility beds in the state and
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
multiplying it by the stipend for those
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
beds so it's just a set amount known on
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
based on the known universe of beds it
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
based on how this is structured it
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily require additional
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
outreach to those facilities to to
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
understand the cost
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
if just a quick follow-up so what is the
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
stipend per bed
 
00:26:39.919 --> 00:26:45.110 align:start position:0%
stipend per bed
2500

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
questions on this uh item
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
thanks matt there we go
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
nope oh i guess i have to hold it down
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
right if you're using the blue button
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
you have to hold it down
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
you can also just press the red button
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
once right and it'll stay there we go
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
a follow follow-up to senator
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
rosenwald's uh question
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
as far as the breakdown of the 39
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars who made that final
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
decision was it you a commissioner or do
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
you have like people still
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
are making recommendations
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
to you with how that breakdown has
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
arrived at so the 39 million dollar
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
number in this item is effectively a
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
reassembly of existing resources from
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
programs that have closed
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh from some of the recruitment
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
activities that are underway right now
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
so that we can get them into the class
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
lines that are necessary to close out
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
the program
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
this program cares act crf program is
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
required to close by the end of this
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
calendar year so so the uh what roughly
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh 20 something million dollars in the
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
three programs that are outlined in this
 
00:28:06.159 --> 00:28:07.110 align:start position:0%
three programs that are outlined in this
item

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
are the uh result of that reassembly
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
into some items that we know where we
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
can get some money out to make a
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
difference in these areas in the senior
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
centers in the food security area and
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
the long-term care beds uh prior to the
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
end of this year so that we get that
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
number down as low as we can possibly
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
get it so we aren't sending any of those
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
funds back to the federal government
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
just to follow up man i'm chair please
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
and and we is who
 
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.710 align:start position:0%
and and we is who
we

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
well we've been the departed gopher
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
has been the uh entity that has been
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for the completion of the
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
cares act program in coordination
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
obviously with the governor's office
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
are there any further
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
yes senator mars
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
i i think we should point out that if
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
this money isn't spent it goes
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
to unemployment
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's right at the end anything that's
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
left over as you recall is in that what
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
we call a waterfall
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
or that will go into the unemployment
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandra
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
at the last meeting of the gopher
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
committee which i was a member of we set
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
aside 25 million dollars in reserve
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
is the 39.5
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
is that 25 part of the 39.5
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
that was uh set aside that's that's
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
number one
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
and number two
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
where did the additional money come from
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
it was from unexpected monies that we
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused by the second
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
question the
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
the difference between the 25 and the
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
five is that monies that were returned
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
that were allocated but weren't spent
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
yes in some part yes those are the
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
recruitment funds uh that have been
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
coming back into dra
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
as a result of the main street program
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
the self program the gap program that
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
we're now currently trying to
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
recirculate back into the business
 
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
community through the recoupment and
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
expense programs
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
these are we're continually working to
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
expand the ability to capture
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
fingerprints across the state especially
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
in key areas where there's high volume
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
and this grant funding will allow us to
 
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
increase our live scan 10 print capture
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
machines adding 10 to the 59 that are
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
already in place across new hampshire
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
is this in response to the significant
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
backlog of fingerprinting requests it is
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's one component of our uh of
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
the work that the department is doing to
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
get through that backlog we need to
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
increase the ability to capture
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
fingerprints across the state due to the
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
increased demand for the service we also
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
need to increase the ability to process
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
those once they're captured so we're
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
adding additional time over time for
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
processing and then also making
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
improvements to the process uh working
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
closely with the fbi to make sure that
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%

thanks
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
i i know it's related to the next item
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
there's 180 million dollars
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
in this um housing assistance fund that
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
um wondering how long the program's been
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
in operation and what percentage
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
of those 180 million dollars have been
 
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.950 align:start position:0%
of those 180 million dollars have been
encumbered

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the uh emergency
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
rental program yes so uh there are two
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
tranches of that resource there's the
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
what we refer to as era one which came
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
in late december of 2020
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
2020 and then there was a second
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
era that came later in the year and
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
together those are
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
just over 300 million dollars
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
i think where we are is
 
00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:02.390 align:start position:0%
i think where we are is
the

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
federal government has um informed us
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
that they're going to start tracking the
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
percentage that we are utilizing and
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
then over the course of the next couple
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
of months implement the formula
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
that will
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
eventually start taking back funds that
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
are unneeded
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
this is part of what you're seeing in
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
this item is
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to continue to spend those
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
resources in eligible activities under
 
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
those programs so that we're returning
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
well so of the 180 million dollars
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
i think that was in
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
um era one
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
what percentage have we encumbered
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask chase to answer that
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
question so um
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
currently on gopher's website there's a
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
dashboard that tracks this fund and the
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
program uh which has been in existence
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
since i think march or april of this
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
year and i believe it's already spent
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
about 50 million dollars
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
um i think the original authorization
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
for this program considered 80 million
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
so that was what we
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
anticipated could potentially be run
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
through over the course of time under
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
era 1 before era 2 came along so now
 
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.390 align:start position:0%
era 1 before era 2 came along so now
there

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
the federal government is sort of
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
deciding how much of each is going to
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up
 
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.710 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up
okay

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
senator daniels
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
question is to uh
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
what services are
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
are offered under housing stability
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
services and what's it mean
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
to keep households stably housed
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
so under this program what it the what
 
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.270 align:start position:0%
so under this program what it the what
the

00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
what the goal is is to as it says keep
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
people in housing and to make sure that
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
they get into housing and we do that
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
through individualized case-by-case um
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
services that are provided on-site for
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
those individuals at each of the
 
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.069 align:start position:0%
those individuals at each of the
shelters

00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
shelters
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
so whether it's you know applying for
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
funding that's available either under
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
the era program or under any other
 
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.069 align:start position:0%
the era program or under any other
programs

00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:40:20.079 --> 00:40:20.870 align:start position:0%
programs
and

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
and those types of services to make sure
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
that they're made taking full advantage
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
of all of what's available to them right
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
i i do have one
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
are you
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
are you projecting that all of this
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
money will be used
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
or are you i mean if we've only
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
given out what 50 million at this point
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do to
 
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.309 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do to
assist

00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
assist
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
other folks in housing stability right
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
so uh as a as a pure rental assistance
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
number i think the projections are that
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
the need and the amount that we have
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
don't line up necessarily but having
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
said that under the era 2 program
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
particularly there's a lot more
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility for how we can utilize those
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
funds in order to get at the same
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
population and and improve the services
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
such as that we're talking about here
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
so right now what we're doing is working
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
with all the parties in on on our side
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
and with hhs and others to make sure
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
that we're using all eligible
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
components of under the program
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
and get as many of those dollars spent
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
as we possibly can
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.829 align:start position:0%

safety and with me is justin romanello
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
the bureau chief of the ems bureau at
 
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
the division of fire standards training
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
and emergency medical services
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for uh being willing just a
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
moment please
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative edwards you have a
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
question i i do thank you madam chair um
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
so this is a simple one i i see the
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
money is coming from the department of
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
health and human services and the
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
purposes is to create uh or to
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
facilitate an efficient emergency
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
evacuation system in the state so um so
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
it looks like there's obviously some
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
level of coordination taking place
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
to um put together
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
to work cooperatively together to ensure
 
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
that we're not doing anything
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
to create redundancies in it systems or
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
other human infrastructures could you
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
could you just talk to us about the
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
level of coordination between you and
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
services to ensure that
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
in the next many years we have an
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
efficient coordination between the
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
departments and that we're not stepping
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
on each other doing anything redundant
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
sure no thank you for the question um so
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's definitely coordination that we
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
have with health and human services one
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the reasons you're seeing this
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
in the department of safety in this
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
division is that
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
the this bureau is responsible for
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
licensing and oversight of our
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
of our ambulances our first responders
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
of the the mobile integrated health
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
programs as they're being developed in
 
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
the state and then also the inter um the
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
the inter-facility transfers which are
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
oftentimes done by ambulance um could
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
also be done by other
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
non-ambulance related vehicles so that
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
oversight is um
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh important and and we can't work in a
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
vacuum and just make these decisions
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
without input from hhs i think i'd turn
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
it over to um to the bureau chief to
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
kind of talk about specifics but we're
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely in coordination
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
so in specific
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
specifically with mih programs we
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
currently have a waiver in process for
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
our providers to waive the health care
 
00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:05.510 align:start position:0%
our providers to waive the health care
license

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
the home health care license requirement
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
a worker that would go into the home so
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
we that's in conjunction with dhhs
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's one way we work uh
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
collaboratively in addition to that any
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
mih programs that are approved are done
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
so with a committee of folks that are
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
part of our division but also with the
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
home healthcare association so there's
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
so there's no overlap of services in
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
fact the mih programs specifically are
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
to augment areas that services can't be
 
00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:42.550 align:start position:0%
to augment areas that services can't be
rendered

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you man i'm sure so it sounds
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
like you're both confident that there
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
are no gaps and overlaps in the the
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
systems as a result of two different
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
departments uh running different
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
portions of it but i just want to ask
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
you directly
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
are you concerned of any gaps or
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
overlaps between yourself
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
and your your mission and and the
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
any gaps any overlaps
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
everything okay
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not concerned with any i don't
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
could i have a motion to accept
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move the item i'm sorry
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me senator daniels thank you good
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
morning morning director
 
00:47:26.559 --> 00:47:27.910 align:start position:0%
morning morning director
uh

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
states here that the overall
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the grant will be
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
determined by the number of emergency
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
medical services units and providers
 
00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.030 align:start position:0%
medical services units and providers
trained

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
trained
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
can you tell me how many have to be
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
trained to be successful and why was
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
that chosen as a metric for for
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
determining whether you have success of
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
the program as opposed to reducing the
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
so i think i understand your question
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
sir so uh
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately when it comes to mobile
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
integrated healthcare programs this is
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
an additional program that services can
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
elect to provide to their communities
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
right now we we have about 19 programs
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
in the state i think we can have much
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
more because it's really preventing uh
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
exacerbation of illness so preventing
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
folks from actually needing an ambulance
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh so i think that even if we just had
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
one more
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
that's better in a community in the
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
state and specifically with mih as far
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
as inner facility transport we're seeing
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
times of three to four hours of wait
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
times and aeds so i think that the more
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
programs we have that can move the
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
sickest of our patients around from our
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
13 critical access hospitals to higher
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
levels of care
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to be an improvement of the
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
system if we can reduce the three to
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
four hour wait times by increasing
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
services such as higher levels of
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
services so anybody right now that that
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
has a transport ems service so there's
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
162 agencies in the state that have an
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
ambulance that can transport a patient
 
00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.109 align:start position:0%
ambulance that can transport a patient
around

00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
we have specialized care such as
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
critical care in what we call pift or
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
paramedic interfacility transport these
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
programs can move patients that are
 
00:49:08.079 --> 00:49:09.270 align:start position:0%
programs can move patients that are
sicker

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
sicker
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
safely around so as we increase
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
those those specialized services and
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
increase our services that have the
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
ability to move those patients around i
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
think this program will be successful i
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
think i answered it sir
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
follow up yes please go ahead so if i
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
understood you correctly if one person
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
was trained you would consider the
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
program successful
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
i think it would be successful in the
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
state because that means that one
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
community is is going to be healthier by
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
having this program
 
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
i i want much more at the end of these
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
two years as far as programs go but
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
i think this is going to provide a
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
resource for us to train many
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
departments in the safe and effective
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
transport of patients around the state
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
as well as as far as mih goes a
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
different way to approach health care in
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
treating patients before they get to a
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
point where not only are they
 
00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.630 align:start position:0%
point where not only are they
uh

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
a higher acuity patient but also they're
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
they're they're potentially going to
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
have a better life be a better
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
better life because they're not
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
exacerbating to the point where there's
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's downwind effects of that if that
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
um yeah and my my question was
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
really just in regard to the metric you
 
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.430 align:start position:0%
really just in regard to the metric you
chose

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
chose
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
to determine whether you know where
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
we're spending
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
was at 300
 
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.710 align:start position:0%
was at 300
370

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
370
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
371 000
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh to be determine whether a program is
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
successful i mean we're always asking
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
how are you determining if this money
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
is being uh spent
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
wisely successfully and i'd say for
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
to train one person while it may be
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
an advantage for that community
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that it necessarily
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
computes into a successful program at
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
one person for 371 000. taking the
 
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.150 align:start position:0%
one person for 371 000. taking the
consideration

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh your comments about the shortness of
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
time the reduction in ambulance calls
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
all those things i would see
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
see as part of a successful program so
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
just questioning the you know that your
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
chosen metric for the success
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
and um and if i may i think i think part
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the uh challenge that we have is mih
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
programs mobile integrated health
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
programs are relatively new um so so
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
part of this program is to promote that
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
um that response within the state so
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
that individuals especially in rural
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
areas uh are not needing to be
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
transported by ambulance um
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
one hour two hours for certain um for
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
certain activities where there's the the
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
first responder community can
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
potentially deliver health care at a
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
local level
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
so i believe because this program is
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
relatively new we only have um how many
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
do we have 19 in in the state at this
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
point um
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
it's difficult we're really looking at
 
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
at the beginnings of this program we
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
want to see more mih programs become
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
established within the state once
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
there's more established now we can get
 
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
into more
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
discrete metrics of reducing times and
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
and that in that matter but we're just
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
not there yet it's so it's so new
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
senator gaiden thank you madam chair
 
00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:22.790 align:start position:0%
senator gaiden thank you madam chair
director

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.549 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
i am concerned as well as senator
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
daniels and i'm wondering if the
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
department would consider providing
 
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
the number of new certified providers
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
as opposed to trainees trainees are
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
useless unless they're actually
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
implemented in the provision of the
 
00:52:41.599 --> 00:52:42.630 align:start position:0%
implemented in the provision of the
service

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
and that would certainly help us get a
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
better measure of how effective the
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
program is obviously there's a need and
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's new but i think
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
would you consider doing that
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
as far as mih goes i i can
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
so part of this this initiative is based
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
off of funds that dhhs accepted uh to
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
for chronic disease
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
in the rural areas of the state and so
 
00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.670 align:start position:0%
in the rural areas of the state and so
um

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately we're seeing that in the next
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
few weeks there could be two to three
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
new mih services
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
incorporated based on the acceptance of
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
and so we want to appropriately support
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
them and that's why we're high we want
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
to hire for these three positions
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
as far as inner facility transport goes
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
right now dartmouth is your only
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
critical uh care resource in the state
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
the single one we have other units
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
coming in that we will license
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
eventually but we're working on some
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to appropriately license
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
those units right now they're coming in
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
as what we call mutual aid our paramedic
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
interfacility transport option that's uh
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
out of the 162 transport services we
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
have about 29 services that that have
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
gone above and beyond and gotten that
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
extra credential and i feel as though if
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
we have these positions we can
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
appropriately support the other 140 ish
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
my math might be a little off
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
in achieving that level of uh credential
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
to appropriately transport those
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
patients around a brief example we
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
looked at it recently with a facility
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
and these numbers are slightly off but a
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
hospital was calling a local service
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
that provides 9-1-1 and they do
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
transfers on occasion
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
to to the residents um and out of 100
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
calls 50 percent of them were at a level
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
that should have been piffed
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
the service was not a pif service and so
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
with these positions we would be able to
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
go out educate the service that hey this
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
is this is advertised to your population
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
that you serve to get this additional
 
00:54:42.319 --> 00:54:43.510 align:start position:0%
that you serve to get this additional
credential

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
credential
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
right now we just don't have the
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
resources to do that without taking
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
those resources from something else
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
because the section of of the division
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
is a single captain right now i mean we
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
need these positions to provide that
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
support excuse me just a second i think
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
that all senator guida was looking for
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
and i think what senator daniels is
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
is that maybe in three months you come
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
back to us with a number
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
of people
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
that have been trained and
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know just send something into us you
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
won't need to come back unless there's a
 
00:55:20.309 --> 00:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
question but what he's look what we're
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for is
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
are we making the progress
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
that needs to be made
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so we can we can certainly
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
provide some some metrics as you're
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
asking um programs that are being added
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
um if if i may i'd recommend maybe
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
within six months three months seems
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
like a short time frame to to see a lot
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
of input we need to hire staff um but at
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
least we can check in within the next
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
six months how do you know where we're
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
at and continue to do so on those
 
00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.510 align:start position:0%
at and continue to do so on those
intervals

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
intervals
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
00:55:50.799 --> 00:55:51.670 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
uh

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
could i have a motion to accept
 
00:55:53.839 --> 00:55:56.950 align:start position:0%
could i have a motion to accept
fis-21296

00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%

okay uh
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
based on um
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
the type of request i guess
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
this could not go on the consent
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
calendar sure
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
00:57:02.799 --> 00:57:03.670 align:start position:0%
and so um
i

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
would uh are there any questions
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
that anyone on the committee might have
 
00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see any
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh if you could just in three minutes
 
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.589 align:start position:0%
uh if you could just in three minutes
max

00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
max
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
explain what this grant is all about
 
00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.190 align:start position:0%
explain what this grant is all about
okay

00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.789 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
i believe this is this has come before
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
you before but it's a it's a three-year
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
grant so what and we haven't spent much
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
out of it yet
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
um so this carries us forward into the
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
next fiscal cycle
 
00:57:42.319 --> 00:57:46.069 align:start position:0%
next fiscal cycle
um

00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
we had we purchased a a farm down on
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
great bay
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
and there was a um
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
the deal part of the deal was is the uh
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
one of the family members could live
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
there uh
 
00:57:59.599 --> 00:58:00.950 align:start position:0%
there uh
um

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
until her
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
and until her death uh that took place
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
at which point we then
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
have started on
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
cleaning the property up and our
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
our couple our goals there are to
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
develop a
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
boat landing historically
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
there was a boat landing there that in
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
the in the summertime was a boat landing
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
in the winter time it was an access

uh thank you madam chair uh
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
i i suspect this is a topic that's going
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
to interest a lot of members of the
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
committee but um just to to kick it off
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
i i i would just like to hear
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's version of
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
of how we got to the point of wanting to
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
buy the hampstead hospital
 
01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.150 align:start position:0%
buy the hampstead hospital
and

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%

01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
about ongoing operations
 
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
should we purchase it
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
and and what we think we know
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
about what we don't know which is you
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
know there's probably some issues
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
related to labor and the like that are
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
still unsettled so if you could just
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
tell us
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
you know your sort of version of of what
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
where we're at and where we're going
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
please sure thank you lori shibana
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner of health and human
 
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.870 align:start position:0%

01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
i just want to stress that this is
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
the first phase of many phases that
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
comes with buying a hospital like
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
hampstead hospital
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
it came before us because hampstead
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
hospital was looking to sell and they
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
are the only provider of inpatient
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
children psychiatric services in our
 
01:03:50.079 --> 01:03:51.270 align:start position:0%
children psychiatric services in our
state

01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
so when we reviewed
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that they were selling we felt
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
it was important to secure this service
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of new hampshire we all
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
know that for the past several years
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
several children waiting in the
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
emergency room for inpatient psychiatric
 
01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.510 align:start position:0%
emergency room for inpatient psychiatric
care

01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 10 to up to 20 right right
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
now i think we're right around the 20
 
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.029 align:start position:0%
now i think we're right around the 20
mark

01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
mark
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
those are kids that potentially are
 
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
going to go to hampstead
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
once it's purchased and the capacity is
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
expanded we know that right now they're
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
operating at a census of 45 they have
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
capacity for 111
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
due to some staffing issues they have
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
not been able to expand their services
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
our goal is to
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
purchase hampstead
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
contract with a third party to to assist
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
in running it similar to the contract at
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital and expand those
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
services both by by bed number and by
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
specialty services so we have several
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
gaps in our children's system
 
01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
you are all familiar with the children's
 
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
behavioral health system of care
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
that continuum requires inpatient
 
01:04:58.319 --> 01:04:59.670 align:start position:0%
that continuum requires inpatient
children

01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
care for for psychiatric care
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
so we will be looking at expanding acute
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
inpatient beds but also looking at
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
whether it is an appropriate site for
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
for longer term
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
psychiatric residential treatment
 
01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.710 align:start position:0%
psychiatric residential treatment
programs

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
we will be looking at adults that are 18
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
to 25 that currently reside in the adult
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
program and whether they're more
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate to be in a special program
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
um located at hampstead
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
so right now we're still in the middle
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
with the purchase and sales have not
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
been signed this is just the part where
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
we accept the federal funds so that we
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
can do the contracting process with
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
hampstead the contract itself will go to
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
governor and council and then the
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
operating budget obviously would come
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
back to fiscal in a variety of forms
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
the the questions around workforce and
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
things like that the personnel that are
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
currently there our intent is not to
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
have anybody lose their jobs we will
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
have a third party maybe leadership
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
maybe state employees
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
but the intent is to continue with their
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
i i got a further question yes ma'am
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
chair i think i think i have uh two more
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
follow-ups if i might but uh
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
so um so
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
so as you know uh we've been looking uh
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
with the special committee to take a
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
look at the the uh closure and
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
replacement of the sununu center yes and
 
01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.510 align:start position:0%
replacement of the sununu center yes and
um

01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
i i i just because we were talking about
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
it yesterday morning in our final
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
meeting of that committee i'm just
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
curious if you have any sort of uh
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not going to hold you to it
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking for sort of an initial
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
gut reaction
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
of whether or not it there is a a
 
01:06:51.039 --> 01:06:52.549 align:start position:0%
of whether or not it there is a a
feasibility

01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
feasibility
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
to having
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
sort of the sununu center
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
the clinical
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
residential portion of it moved over
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
there because we're trying to get away
 
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
from incarceration and more into
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
counseling and caregiving and so
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
co-location seems to have some benefits
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
do you have sort of a just sort of an
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
initial reaction of you know no never
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
and it would never make any sense to
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
and it's worth looking at
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
so um i wouldn't recommend that you
 
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.510 align:start position:0%
so um i wouldn't recommend that you
co-locate

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
co-locate
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
the youth at
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
sununu center within the hospital of
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
hampstead hospital but the campus itself
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
is 110 acres i think the the goal
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
looking at the replacement facility for
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
sununu is that we're looking at any
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
state-owned properties and how that
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
could be developed if the state
 
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
purchases property i would assume that
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
we are also going to review this
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
property for is an appropriate setting
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
now the overall goal for the department
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
is to create a children's uh
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
system of care and a
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
center of excellence for chi for youth
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
we certainly want to extend that center
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
of excellence into the youth that are
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
that are at syse right now
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
whether it can be located on the same
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
campus is not something that we've
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
reviewed at this point
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
and then one more if i may yes go ahead
 
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.669 align:start position:0%
and then one more if i may yes go ahead
so

01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.679 --> 01:08:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
we're just having manpower problems all
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
over the state and i think hampstead
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
hospital has suffered from workforce
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
shortages um
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
what what what is what is your
 
01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:36.309 align:start position:0%
what what what is what is your
sense

01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:37.590 align:start position:0%
sense
that

01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to figure out how
 
01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
to get the manpower or the workforce in
 
01:08:42.799 --> 01:08:43.829 align:start position:0%
to get the manpower or the workforce in
there

01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
that would be adequate
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
to making hampstead hospital truly a
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
business viable concern
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
hampstead hospital in its
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
in the current form is a viable business
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
that has been operated as a private
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
business for 40 years um with that truck
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
with the trust that it that it's uh that
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
it works with
 
01:09:04.839 --> 01:09:06.789 align:start position:0%
it works with
so

01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
the intent is to partner with a third
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
party and to offer employment for the
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the hampstead staff
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
between the state and the third party
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
collaboration it is that point that we
 
01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
need to look at
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
hiring additional staff to increase
 
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
services but right now they're operating
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
at 45 beds and we anticipate that the
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
vast majority of staff are going to want
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
to come over and work with
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
either the state or the third party
 
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.390 align:start position:0%
either the state or the third party
partner

01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i just one last one
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman i i this is my
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
last question i do do you happen to know
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
what the hampstead hospital's uh
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
prospective policy is on mandating the
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
covet vaccination for all employees i do
 
01:09:53.759 --> 01:09:54.950 align:start position:0%
covet vaccination for all employees i do
not

01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
do could you could you just check into
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
it and have someone just let me know
 
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
sure all right thank you
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
senator mars
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you commissioner having been
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
involved in this since the beginning
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
um i don't think this is any surprise
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
the speaker and i were briefed on this a
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
while ago i think
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen every day that the
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
state is able to get into a purchase and
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
sales agreement
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
which they have to treat like any other
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
business would have it was kept silent
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
for a long period of time i can assure
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
you it's the intention at least on
 
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
the senate side that we want to be
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
involved in the creation in the future
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
of this and
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
i think questions of whether or not the
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
employees are going to be there and
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
working for the state or working for
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
some other organization
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want to see any employees go
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere right now in the state of new
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire um so i guess we can send that
 
01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
message to everybody including the
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals to put out a statement
 
01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:00.950 align:start position:0%
hospitals to put out a statement
yesterday

01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
that we want to make sure every employee
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
stays right where they are so having
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
said that this is a great idea i
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you're doing right now i
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that we're going to
 
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
build something great here because
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
as a senator when i get these phone
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
calls and someone's in the hospital for
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
12 days and the mother's sitting right
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
there alongside the child
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
we need more and we know that and this
 
01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
was a good solution um
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
a quite affordable price because we're
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
building other right now buildings for
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
25 people that are a heck of a lot more
 
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
money than this triple this amount of
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
money um and to be able to buy this and
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
have the extra land that hampstead
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
hospital has
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
on that campus i think we can do some
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
great things there and i appreciate the
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
work you've put into this thank you
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
senator you know i want to stress that
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
when we began the negotiations with
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
hampstead their main concern in this
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
negotiation was one that we maintain the
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
mission of the facility and they have a
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
great reputation in the community and
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
two that we take care of their team
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
and we are committed to doing both of
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
those things with the hampstead team and
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
maintaining the mission of hampstead
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
hospital so i agree with you i think it
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
a long-term solution and a great
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you senator rosenwald
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to just circle back to your
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
comment that the operating budget would
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
be run through fiscal committee
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
or through the budget depending on when
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
it would definitely be through the
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee because if it if it's
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
not this fiscal year to the next fiscal
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
year which will still be before another
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
budget is created
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
so the last paragraph of the letter
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
speaks to why the operating budget isn't
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
presented at the same time as this item
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
a number of things we need to continue
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
to research and determine before we can
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
determine the operating budget
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
so there would not be a
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
i mean the senate's in in filing period
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
right now you're not looking
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
to have the entire legislature weigh in
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
through a
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
special appropriation
 
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
i i don't think so i think that um
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be requesting general funds
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
for this fiscal year or next fiscal year
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
if uh additional funds are necessary we
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
would request arpa funds
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
um so that would come here through the
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
thanks madam shearer
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
i've always been concerned with late
 
01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.709 align:start position:0%
i've always been concerned with late
items

01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
items
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
i think some of us received information
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
as late as late yesterday afternoon
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
i don't dispute senator morse's
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
statements that this is needed this is a
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
great opportunity but
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
i have real reservations how quickly
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
this is moving
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
the commitment the state would be making
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
by acquiring this facility and then the
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
funding of this facility
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
as you stated
 
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
you have not put together any sort of
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
operating budget at this time and you
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
specifically say in your letter to us
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
that there won't be a request for
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm concerned madam chair that this
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
is moving a little too fast i think
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh i can't support the item as it's
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
being presented today i think what would
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate is that
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
the chair of your calling scheduled a
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
meeting so this can be discussed by
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
itself give the public a little more
 
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
input in the process but i cannot
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
support it as it's been presented thus
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
far and i i'm sorry because i know a lot
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
of people have spent some time on this
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
like senator morris has said but
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see more information i
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
believe the request that is before us is
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
just a little vague
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
may i clarify something
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
yes we did not state in the letter that
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
general funds would not be requested
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
i i don't believe that as stated in the
 
01:15:10.159 --> 01:15:11.350 align:start position:0%
i i don't believe that as stated in the
letter

01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
letter
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
i could read it to you
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
it says in the event of these federal
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
funds become no longer available general
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
funds will not be requested to support
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
this program honestly i would read that
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
is that the hospital would be the
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
program carrying forward it's on page
 
01:15:28.159 --> 01:15:29.750 align:start position:0%
program carrying forward it's on page
two

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
or at the bottom of uh what i have here
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
that was presented um
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
two of two
 
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
i think you might be on item uh
 
01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.790 align:start position:0%
i think you might be on item uh
315.

01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
315.
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
it says 314 as it was in my package okay
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
that must be incorrect because i have
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
314 in front of me not having that
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
statement 315 does 314 has three pages
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
three fourteen has two pages yeah excuse
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%

available for pre-fiscal
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh however um we had a copying glitch
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.270 align:start position:0%

behind it yeah you got you got the
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
glitch uh what happened is they uh
 
01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.790 align:start position:0%
glitch uh what happened is they uh
accidentally

01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
accidentally
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
attached 315
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
second page to 314 and vice versa
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
senator morris
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative leachman we just wanted
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
to see if you were reading it um
 
01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:45.910 align:start position:0%
to see if you were reading it um
yeah

01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:46.709 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
mr kane said he's bad so i think well
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
the um and maybe the commissioner can
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
clarify things because i didn't sit on
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
the last budget but i sat on this
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
current one um
 
01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.310 align:start position:0%
current one um
when

01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
we tried to solve problems with
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
we were moving the children out of new
 
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital to create 50 beds
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
because every child you take out you can
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
get two
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
we ran into glitches i believe last year
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
where we had to find room for children
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know for all of us that have
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
been involved in mental health since
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
2014 and trying to restructure things in
 
01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
all we're asking today
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
is the 15 million to take out of opera
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
to finish negotiating a deal that is in
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
place um
 
01:17:39.679 --> 01:17:40.870 align:start position:0%
place um
which

01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
can't be more public than it is today
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
quite honestly but
 
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think you could find a hundred
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
bed hospital for 15 million dollars or
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
whatever that purchase price is within
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
that 15 million dollars
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
it just i don't see how it could happen
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
this is some group of people at the
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
other end that are trying to help the
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
and what i believe has become a crisis
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
now along with that i believe the
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
commission is working with several of
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
the hospitals to create more drff beds
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
but all of these things and this is what
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
i assured the senate this morning are
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
going to go through a senate process of
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
how to operate it and what the expenses
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
and how new hampshire will use it but i
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't think there was ever a time
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
where we said we didn't need drf beds
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
for children
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
and that's what this is attempting to
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
solve and even if you were only solving
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
it for the 25 children that we moved out
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire hospital
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're not building anything right now
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
that's less than 30 million dollars
 
01:18:52.719 --> 01:18:53.430 align:start position:0%
that's less than 30 million dollars
for

01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
25 units
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
and we're going to get a 100 bed unit
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
and we're going to get all that extra
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
land it just happens to be down by my
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
district so i know exactly where it is
 
01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
this this is a good investment for the
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire how you operate
 
01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
it will become your good investment it
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
will become
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
all of the legislature to be honest with
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
you because i don't see how you can make
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
a decision just with fiscal on this i i
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
think it's going to take both you know
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
finance committees and the health
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
committees to come up with the plan to
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
work with the commissioner on and it's a
 
01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
long way in the out that's why the
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
governor didn't answer those questions
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
when he broke this the other day but
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
quite honestly securing this and getting
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
the deal done is equally as important as
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
operating it in my opinion and that's
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
what today's about and and i actually
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
would appreciate your vote because i
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
know the speaker's been briefed on this
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
the whole time i was briefed on it um
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
and keeping things quiet around here are
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
tough i actually got phone calls about
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
this in the middle of it
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
where people from the outside knew more
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
than i did um and
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
i said i can't talk about it so i'm not
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
ducking anything right now i certainly
 
01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
have been part of that mental health
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
changeover in the state and to me
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
this is something that really benefits
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
thanks for your comments
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
at the top of page three
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
the the land acquisition and the
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
easement paragraph
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
which i think is the correct
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
um copy
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
yes yes but i think i understand that
 
01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:40.870 align:start position:0%
yes yes but i think i understand that
that

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
basically hampstead is running a profit
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
of 15 million dollars at least
 
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
that income
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're expecting is at least 15 million
 
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
dollars above what their
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
liabilities are and so we might you're
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
expecting we won't even need the
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars of arpa funds
 
01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.590 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars of arpa funds
anyway

01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
when will we know that
 
01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:11.350 align:start position:0%
when will we know that
so

01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.310 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
the purchase is actually the first
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
expense line 33
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
which is described at the bottom of page
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
two that just says purchase of property
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
so that's related to the 13 million
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
the two million dollars uh i should have
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
clarified that when i put that in the
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
narrative i apologize is the top of page
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
three and that two million dollars is
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
part of the uh structure of the purchase
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
and sales
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
structure between accounts payable and
 
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
accounts receivable that essentially
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
becomes our responsibility once we're
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
once we've purchased it and so this is
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
just to help manage that it's really a
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
cash flow issue
 
01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:51.590 align:start position:0%
cash flow issue
um

01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
and so those offer funds shouldn't be
 
01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:54.950 align:start position:0%
and so those offer funds shouldn't be
needed

01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully once that closes out we're
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
still working out how that will work
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
exactly but i wanted to make sure that
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
we could pay the bills that will need to
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.639 --> 01:22:09.430 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:10.870 align:start position:0%
 
that's

01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
two two is my hope
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
they may end up need some of it but at
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
this point that's my hope is that that
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
won't be actually needed it's more of a
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
cash flow issue
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro you have a question
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chip
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
excuse me i did have a couple one was
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
the 13 was for the building
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
the the the two million is for the land
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
who made the that assessment
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
so the the 2 million is not for the land
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
the 13 million is for the building and
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
the landed for the entire purchase and
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
sales the 2 million is for the accounts
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
payable accounts receivable transactions
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
but on the front page it says land in
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
acquisition payments 2 million is that a
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
mistake unfortunately there's no other
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
class line that really uh was
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate to to use um and we try not
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
to create new class lines for one
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
transaction so because it is related to
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
the purchase and sales i discuss with
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
services and use the same class line
 
01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.830 align:start position:0%
services and use the same class line
okay

01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
but indeed if i were reading this i
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
would be misled
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
well that's why i put the explanation on
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:19.350 --> 01:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
i'm definitely trying not to i tried to
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
include a lot more detail as promised at
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
the last meeting i appreciate that
 
01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.310 align:start position:0%
the last meeting i appreciate that
um

01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
let me just say that
 
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
quickly because i've spent a lot of time
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
on this we've been in the dark on this
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
really and i understand what senator
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
moses said
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
i have complete confidence in what he
 
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
has done
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
and i will support this based on his
 
01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:41.110 align:start position:0%
and i will support this based on his
assurance

01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
assurance
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
a that the deal will be consummated
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
properly under state regulations etc and
 
01:23:46.159 --> 01:23:47.270 align:start position:0%
properly under state regulations etc and
that

01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
what we really really need is a place to
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
put our children
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
now i've talked with heather oakland
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
more than anybody has in this in this
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
board i'm sure
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes on a daily basis about who's
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
we took the children out
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
to create beds for the adults we had to
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
reintroduce the children because we
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
didn't have a place for them hampstead
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't take them just couldn't take
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
the volume so we recreated 10 beds at
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
the hospital there was a cost associated
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
with both of those things
 
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
retrofitting for 40
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
re-retrofeeding for 10
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
after you have retrofitted for 40. we
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
put 5 million dollars aside for that in
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
in the last operating budget
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
i'd like us to use our money wisely
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
i mean that's that's why we're own
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
oversight committee but as i said i'll
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
vote for the issue senator morse based
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
on on you
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%

representative leitchman thanks madam
chair

01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner do you have a rough idea
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
you must have some you know
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
figures on a napkin somewhere the cost
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
of running this facility should you be
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
successful in acquiring it
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
i only have um we have what uh it cost
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
hampstead to run their facility um so
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
the current beds the intent would be
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
obviously to take over that operation
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
do additional beds and additional
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
services beyond what they are currently
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
doing there are some uh different
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursement sources that are going to
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
engage enter into this equation such as
 
01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:48.950 align:start position:0%
engage enter into this equation such as
dish

01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
dish
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
payments when we get when it becomes
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
state-owned so
 
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
yes we we could look at what hampstead
 
01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719 align:start position:0%
um paid or what what their operating
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
expenses were um and what the net is i
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
can tell you that prior to covid um they
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
were net positive
 
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
meaning that their revenue was more than
 
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719 align:start position:0%
their expenses um that that will change
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
as we as we move into different areas of
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
care and we we take more um
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
medicaid kids uh less kids from out of
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
state things like that
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
but prior the year prior to covet
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
they were net positive
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
thank you and i do have a statement
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
there's very few people i respect more
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
than senator morris so i will be voting
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%

madam chair just uh as i was sitting
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
here thinking about 110 acres
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the property tax
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
status of hampstead hospital is today it
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
just makes me wonder uh what the impact
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be on the local community is
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
there what is the property tax
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
implication of shifting this from
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
private hands to
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
um to state hands
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
the property tax implication is part of
 
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
the discussions that we are having right
 
01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.070 align:start position:0%
the discussions that we are having right
now

01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
so both within the purchase and sales
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
and with the town of hampstead uh
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
they've asked uh both myself and melissa
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
st seer to come and present to them so
 
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to be part of the
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
discussion i don't have an answer right
 
01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.830 align:start position:0%
discussion i don't have an answer right
now

01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
so the implica oh and i'll let senator
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
morris answer if he wants
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
yeah they've already contacted the
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
senator from that district so i believe
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's about a hundred and fifty thousand
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
dollars is the property tax um
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
i think these things have been solved in
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
many different ways in the past i mean
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
in louis taxes and things like that
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to look at it um we're
 
01:27:52.239 --> 01:27:53.110 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to look at it um we're
not

01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%

um as i as i read this this is uh this
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
is 4.68 million dollars approximately
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's all 100 arpa money uh it's coming
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
to us without any specific strings
 
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh this is money that uh the state
 
01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:03.910 align:start position:0%
uh this is money that uh the state
will

01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:04.950 align:start position:0%
will
um

01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
can convert to our control
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
and that you'll be able to invest in
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
an immunization program
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
that sort of matches new hampshire's
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
culture and character
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
of rolling the vaccines out to make them
 
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
available on a voluntary basis to anyone
 
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the state that wants it is that is
 
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
that somewhat accurate or yes
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
um uh follow-up
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
please go ahead
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay and then um
 
01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.270 align:start position:0%
okay and then um
we

01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:30:38.239 --> 01:30:39.189 align:start position:0%
i think
uh

01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
i i just i think we're in a situation
 
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:42.790 align:start position:0%
i i just i think we're in a situation
where

01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
covid is not going away it's gonna
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
continue to mutate into different
 
01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:48.470 align:start position:0%
continue to mutate into different
variants

01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
variants
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
this is a long term
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
issue it's not
 
01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
going to go away next year it's not
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to go in five years it's probably
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
going to just keep on mutating we're
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
always going to be dealing with covet is
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
is is that is that
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
true you think
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
i think that there will be a point where
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
where it becomes endemic similar to
 
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.149 align:start position:0%
where it becomes endemic similar to
influenza

01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
influenza
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
where there is a
 
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
baseline of covet in the communities and
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
like influenza
 
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
we get
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
many of us get flu vaccines every year
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
to fight the strains that are currently
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
circulating in the community
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
it is likely that covid will become
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
endemic and there will be a baseline in
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
the community for many years to come
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that mr paul one more
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
i've asked you a few times in a few
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
different settings over the last couple
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
of months about uh what the department's
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
position is relative to what we think we
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
know about natural immunity and what we
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
do you have any updates for us on on
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
where where the science is at in terms
 
01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.629 align:start position:0%
where where the science is at in terms
of

01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
believing that natural immunity may be a
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
third way we have vacs we have unvacs do
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
we have natural immunity and i i noticed
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
st luke's and
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
and pennsylvania has told their
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
employees that if they have natural
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
immunity they can go a year without
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
having to worry about fact status
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
do we have any new news on
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
natural immunity i have no new news to
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
share right now we share the notion that
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
um even if you have natural immunity a
 
01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine is extra protective for you and
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
so we're continuing to follow the
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
science there we believe that the
 
01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
booster in particular will give you sort
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
of a top off like you would top off your
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
gas tank we believe that that provides
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
extra protection um but we're continuing
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
to review the science as it comes in
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
what we do know if i can just add to
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
that is that in the last several months
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
we've watched vaccine breakthrough cases
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of our hospitalizations
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
increase last fiscal i talked about the
 
01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
90 10 about 90 percent of people in the
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
hospital are unvaccinated and that's
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
still approximately our average over the
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
last 10 months but what we've seen is it
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
go from 90 10 in july august to 80 20 in
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
in september and now around 30 of our
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations are are fully
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
vaccinated people and what that points
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
us to is waning immunity um so that
 
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's why the boosters are so important
 
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
especially with people over 65 and
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
people that have underlying health
 
01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:24.070 align:start position:0%
people that have underlying health
conditions

01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman thank you
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
madam commissioner for answering the
 
01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.950 align:start position:0%
madam commissioner for answering the
questions

01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
oh yes senator daniels sorry
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just to kind of follow up
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
on representative edward's question
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
because i'm not sure
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
that i get the exact answer uh but where
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
it states that this money is available
 
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
for voluntary school-based
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
clinics is it am i correct in
 
01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.030 align:start position:0%
clinics is it am i correct in
understanding

01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
that if a school has a vaccine mandated
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
policy that they would not be eligible
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
for this money
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
no that's incorrect any any state funded
 
01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine program
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
is accessible to any citizen the state
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
citizen in the state regardless of their
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
their reason or their desire for getting
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
the vaccine
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
so along with
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
the school-based clinics or uh the the
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
fqhcs which will be holding vaccine
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
clinics across the state
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
if there is a mandate from an employer
 
01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:21.110 align:start position:0%
if there is a mandate from an employer
or

01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
they would still have accessibility to
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
that to that vaccine um i think we've
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
been clear
 
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
for for months now that the state will
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
not have a vaccine mandate and we don't
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
so so how can one have a voluntary
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
school-based clinic with a
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
mandated policy
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
um we don't mandate anything the
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
would not mandate it the division of
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
public health would not mandate it um if
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
if there is a mandate by an individual
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
organization an individual private
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
business that is out of the control of
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
the state government
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
but the accessibility to the to the
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine is for everyone regardless of
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
once again if i may i want to i want to
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
read what it says to support clover 19
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine delivery
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
within voluntary school based clinics
 
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:23.270 align:start position:0%
within voluntary school based clinics
and

01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out what a
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
voluntary school-based clinic is that me
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
to that to me that means that they have
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
not adopted a mandated vaccine policy
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
yes similar to how we do uh flu clinics
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
right now we're doing flu clinics in
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
schools for voluntary school-based
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
clinics for the influenza vaccine very
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
similar to that program that we've run
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
no i i think i would just
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
suggest that the voluntary school-based
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
clinics we will be funding our regional
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
public health networks the regional
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
public health work networks nor the
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
fqhcs have any mandates to the
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner's point someone who arrives
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
at one of those clinics may be doing
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
that for a variety of reason but the
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
voluntary clinic is that the clinic
 
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
senator gaiden
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.990 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
commissioner

01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
my concern is about the date of privacy
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that you're on
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
that's tess
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay bring it closer thank you sorry
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah my concern is about the privacy of
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
data the collection of any data can you
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
expound on what will be collected and
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
where it will go and how it may be
 
01:36:46.159 --> 01:36:47.430 align:start position:0%
where it will go and how it may be
protected

01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
protected
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
so uh covert vaccine data is required to
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
be reported to the cdc um all of our
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine providers report that through
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
one of many ways either directly to the
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
cdc or through our vaccine registry with
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
an opto clause
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes thank you madam chair um
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
can you describe the opt-in process is
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
it just a one-time uh is there
 
01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:12.950 align:start position:0%
it just a one-time uh is there
um

01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
is that a blanket opt-in for boosters
 
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
again i'm concerned about the the right
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
of an individual to withdraw from a
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
program once they've started way down
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
that road our vaccine registry statute
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
is an opt out not an opt in but i'm
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
going to have trisha explain the
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
difference between opt out and
 
01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:30.470 align:start position:0%
difference between opt out and
withdrawal

01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
withdrawal
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
sure thank you senator so at every
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine opportunity you will be provided
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
with an opt-out option especially within
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
these clinics right here in our
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
federally qualified health centers and
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
our regional public health networks i
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
will say that there are some farm retail
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
pharmacies that have a direct
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
relationship with the federal government
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
they are currently not sending us any
 
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
data and so you may not get an opt-out
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
in those environments because they're
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
not sending us their data anyway at this
 
01:37:58.239 --> 01:38:01.109 align:start position:0%
not sending us their data anyway at this
moment

01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
yes so can you explain about this opt
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
out process
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it's maybe a little
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
bit convoluted it's not like you sign a
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
form saying i opt in
 
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
you just don't
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
not opt-in can you help me with that
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
sure so everyone who receives a vaccine
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
by one of that by one of our registered
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
providers so they're they're in a
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
relationship with the department and the
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
immunization information system which is
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
what we call our registry
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
they are supposed to educate their
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
patient and say if you want to opt out
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
this is how you do it there is a one
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
simple form you sign it and the provider
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
then provides that information to us so
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
we can i and they they take care of it
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
within their system
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
it is currently under our current rules
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
i believe you would need to have an
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
opt-out at every time you get vaccinated
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's part of the reason we were looking
 
01:38:52.159 --> 01:38:53.189 align:start position:0%
it's part of the reason we were looking
at

01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
changing those rules to make it a little
 
01:38:57.109 --> 01:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
bit easier for individuals but we know
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
that the legislature is going to want to
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
weigh in on what that process looks like
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
in the future so we held off so that we
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
could um hear what the legislature wants
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
in the direction they want to go
 
01:39:07.199 --> 01:39:08.709 align:start position:0%
in the direction they want to go
follow

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
okay just to remind you that
 
01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:13.430 align:start position:0%
okay just to remind you that
this

01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
fis is not dealing with the
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
so if we could focus on
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
the 4.6 i would appreciate it madam
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
chair if i may um
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
i think in the process of receiving
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
the vaccination it would invoke
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
participation in the registry and for
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
that reason i'd ask to continue that's
 
01:39:35.199 --> 01:39:35.830 align:start position:0%
that reason i'd ask to continue that's
why

01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
so does the department require
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
a form to be provided to anyone coming
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
to get a vaccine
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
what we provide is to to our providers
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
we inform them how the opt out process
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
works it is a incumbent upon the
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
providers themselves to make that
 
01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:56.719 align:start position:0%
information available to their patients
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
follow up so what we have is no no
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
assurance really that a provider is in
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
fact complying with the law regarding
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
the privacy so we have a monitoring
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
process that we do we do monitoring both
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
from a federal perspective we have to
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
monitor the use in in the distribution
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
of any vaccine right now and we also
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
work very closely with all of our
 
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
providers to ensure that they have the
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
education that they need in order to
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
meet our statute
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair you're quite
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
if i go to a pharmacy
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
even report it generally to
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
the state it goes directly to the cdc
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
that is correct yeah and so
 
01:40:44.239 --> 01:40:46.149 align:start position:0%
that is correct yeah and so
um

01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
if people are concerned about the
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
privacy of their
 
01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.229 align:start position:0%
privacy of their
vaccine

01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
01:40:52.239 --> 01:40:53.830 align:start position:0%
vaccine
status

01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
status
 
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
they should in fact go to one of the
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
state authorized
 
01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:01.910 align:start position:0%
state authorized
clinics

01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
clinics
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
these clinics have a direct relationship
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
with the federal government um and they
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
are providing vaccine through the
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
through the federal vaccine program not
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily the state
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
they do not report into our registry um
 
01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:15.990 align:start position:0%
they do not report into our registry um
the

01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
the solution to have them reporting into
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
our registry was in the was in the prior
 
01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:23.109 align:start position:0%
our registry was in the was in the prior
um

01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
the prior items the 22 million
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
which was the the registry items there's
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
no no money in this 4.68
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
million that uh supports the registry
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
outside of uh senators guida statement
 
01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
that you know people that get the vax
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
the vaccine will either be reported to
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh the cdc through the federal program
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
or through the state registry
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
if they don't opt out if they don't if
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
they don't opt out and we have done
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
education we we sent a a a memo in july

observation number nine is identified as
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting legislative action may be
 
01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:55.189 align:start position:0%
suggesting legislative action may be
required

01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%

the comments
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
the observations begin over on page 3
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
with the first three observations
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
discussing the need to implement formal
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
turning over to page three observation
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
number one recommends the department
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
implement formal policies and procedures
 
01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
to strengthen its review of second
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
injury fund medical disbursements
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
control activities such as review and
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
approval are an essential component of
 
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
internal controls and an expansion of
 
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
the department's controls over this
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
process could help reduce the risk of
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
errors and omissions
 
01:47:30.149 --> 01:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
we recommend the department implement a
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
process to obtain and review supporting
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
documentation from insurance carriers on
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
a sample basis for requested medical
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
observation number two over on page four
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
notes the department had not established
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%

i would like to thank the department and
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
also the department of administrative
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
services for the assistance we received
 
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
during the audit the commissioner and
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
his staff were very responsive to all of
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
our requests and comments
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
and at this time we'd be happy to answer
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee may
 
01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:03.350 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee may
have

01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
senator daniels thank you i have a
 
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
question on uh observation number five
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
my question is why is it a deficiency
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
against the department when it is the
 
01:53:16.159 --> 01:53:17.750 align:start position:0%
against the department when it is the
responsibility

01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
of uh do it to develop and implement a
 
01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:27.270 align:start position:0%
of uh do it to develop and implement a
strategy

01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
i think the um
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
obviously the department bears
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
first and foremost responsibility to to
 
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
protect um but i think that um if i if i
 
01:53:42.159 --> 01:53:43.669 align:start position:0%
protect um but i think that um if i if i
may

01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
we have um
 
01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:46.070 align:start position:0%
we have um
uh

01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
john clinchy is uh it does a lot of rit
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
auditing and he crafted this response
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
so i think and actually had specific
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
conversations with doit as the basis of
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
this if i may like to call him ford
 
01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
maybe he can respond
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
john clinch i'm a senior audit manager
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
with the office of legislative budget
 
01:54:17.119 --> 01:54:18.390 align:start position:0%
with the office of legislative budget
assistant

01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:20.070 align:start position:0%
assistant
um

01:54:20.070 --> 01:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
the reason um we put it in this report
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
was we felt it was a shared
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility of both the department of
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
information technology and the
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh the way the security breaks down in
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
the state is the resp the
 
01:54:35.910 --> 01:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
department of information technology is
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for some things and the
 
01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
department of labor is responsible for
 
01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:40.870 align:start position:0%
department of labor is responsible for
others

01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why we included it in the
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
report because it is critical to the
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
financial statements
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:52.629 --> 01:54:52.639 align:start position:0%
yeah just to follow up
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
but it does happen it's actually in
 
01:54:54.239 --> 01:54:55.510 align:start position:0%
but it does happen it's actually in
quotes

01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
quotes
 
01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:56.550 align:start position:0%
quotes
that

01:54:56.550 --> 01:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:58.310 align:start position:0%
that
doit

01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
doit
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
is responsible for quote developing and
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
implementing a strategy to address cyber
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
security so i would expect to see such a
 
01:55:09.589 --> 01:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
deficiency in an audit against doit but
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
i was just curious as to
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
why the department of labor
 
01:55:17.669 --> 01:55:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
held efficient
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
in doing that when it clearly states
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
that it's the responsibility of a
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
different department
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
currently we're not doing an audit of
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
the department of information technology
 
01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
so we don't really have a vehicle to
 
01:55:36.390 --> 01:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
publicly disclose that there is no
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
security plan
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
written security plan for the state
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
we felt that it was important enough to
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
put in this report and get the
 
01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
department of information technology's
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
response on record and to let you folks
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
know about the situation
 
01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative edwards uh i'll i'll
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
stay on uh observation five but madam
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
chair i'd also like to talk about four
 
01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
and nine
 
01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
um on on uh observation five uh i'm i'm
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
an old um privacy and security guy and i
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
noticed your paragraph is labeled i t
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
security and i don't see the word
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
privacy so would you
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
tell me what your audit philosophy is as
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
you're looking at i.t security the
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
extent to which you do or do not
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
consider the privacy issues also
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
i think privacy is embedded in security
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
you can't have privacy without security
 
01:56:43.589 --> 01:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
so security is more of a global term
 
01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
as far as audit goes we look at the
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
confidentiality integrity and
 
01:56:50.229 --> 01:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
availability of data
 
01:56:50.239 --> 01:56:53.270 align:start position:0%
availability of data
systems

01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
for standards we use
 
01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
the federal information system
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
control audit manual
 
01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:03.270 align:start position:0%
and that
discusses

01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
discusses
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
security in a broad manner and again
 
01:57:09.669 --> 01:57:09.679 align:start position:0%
within that is confidentiality
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up go ahead so so just just so
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know i've just been talking and
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
musing with a lot of people that given
 
01:57:23.350 --> 01:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
that we pass a privacy
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional right in 2018 that
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
overall the state government may want to
 
01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
improve its culture relative to a
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
privacy by design everywhere just
 
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
a comment uh and then uh
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
observation four
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay um i would like to read a quote
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
from here because i think the public
 
01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:50.719 align:start position:0%
should hear this
 
01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
on page six
 
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
second paragraph from the bottom the
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
final couple sentences
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
a strategic plan commissioned by the
 
01:58:02.589 --> 01:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
department and facilitated by
 
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
pricewaterhousecoopers in august of 1999
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
advised the department to retire the
 
01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:11.669 align:start position:0%
advised the department to retire the
as400

01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
as400
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
in 14 to 16 months
 
01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
the good news is the department
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
requested funds in this current fiscal
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
year to fully mitigate this old it
 
01:58:22.159 --> 01:58:23.189 align:start position:0%
year to fully mitigate this old it
system

01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
i i don't think you have audit findings
 
01:58:30.070 --> 01:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
in here relative to the failure of the
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
legislature or or maybe the governor's
 
01:58:32.639 --> 01:58:33.669 align:start position:0%
legislature or or maybe the governor's
office

01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:58:33.679 --> 01:58:34.790 align:start position:0%
office
but

01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
i could could you talk to us a little
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
bit about
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
how it's possible to go 20 years with
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
the system that we know needs to be
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
replaced and what
 
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
really structurally
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
the way
 
01:58:51.270 --> 01:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
of of doing the doing the job when it
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
needed to be done
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
i think i'd like to refer that to the
 
01:58:57.030 --> 01:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
labor uh to better answer that question
 
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
he's more familiar with the history of
 
01:59:06.149 --> 01:59:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:08.070 --> 01:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
good morning uh ken merrifield
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department of labor
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
only with first-hand knowledge of the
 
01:59:17.910 --> 01:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
last four years uh that it became
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
obvious to me immediately that our
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
systems were antiquated needed to be
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
replaced the the greater need presently
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
was to replace our document management
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
system uh which is some 20 years old and
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
not supported in current uh operating
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
system environments
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
so that was the first phase
 
01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:40.870 align:start position:0%
so that was the first phase
but

01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
no kidding this week we had a vendor on
 
01:59:46.149 --> 01:59:46.159 align:start position:0%
site who is in charge of that project to
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
talk about full migration off of the
 
01:59:51.189 --> 01:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
system and as as you correctly point out
 
01:59:54.390 --> 01:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
we've uh requested funds to do exactly
 
01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:56.310 align:start position:0%
we've uh requested funds to do exactly
that

01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:58.870 --> 01:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
prior prior administrations i
 
02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
i can't really comment i don't know why
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
go ahead i appreciate it it's difficult
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
even if you wanted to or knew
 
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
why the legislature and the governor has
 
02:00:13.589 --> 02:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
failed for 20 years
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
but i get to uh over to observation
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's nine
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
where you you list some rsas
 
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
and it just makes me wonder if we should
 
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.750 align:start position:0%
and it just makes me wonder if we should
put

02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
put
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
into legislation some sort of a
 
02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:31.109 align:start position:0%
into legislation some sort of a
strategic

02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
strategic
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
planning function for it
 
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
so that we we see on you know on a
 
02:00:39.430 --> 02:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
five-year forecasted basis what the i.t
 
02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh upgrades are needed to be anticipated
 
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
and and maybe right into the legislation
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
some sort of formal sign off or vote by
 
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature to indicate you know yes
 
02:00:56.229 --> 02:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
we accept your plan or know we reject
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
your plan because i think we need to get
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
on the record um
 
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
going 20 years with an as400 is an
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
embarrassment and i i would i'm sorry
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
that we send uh representative or uh
 
02:01:11.669 --> 02:01:11.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner goulet around the nation uh
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
with that kind of
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
a track record that he's got to carry
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
with him so
 
02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
um so if you have any thoughts on what
 
02:01:20.229 --> 02:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
we might need to do
 
02:01:24.149 --> 02:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
to embed strategic i.t planning in a
 
02:01:27.669 --> 02:01:27.679 align:start position:0%
forecasted basis so that we are more
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
responsive i i'd be interested in your
 
02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:34.470 align:start position:0%
responsive i i'd be interested in your
thoughts

02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:36.490 align:start position:0%
yes uh please come up
 
02:01:36.490 --> 02:01:43.430 align:start position:0%
yes uh please come up
[Music]

02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
i think i i i would agree with that i
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
think that's something that we can
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
certainly work on and you know we can
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
work on developing information related
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair um members of
 
02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:00.639 align:start position:0%
the committee um dennis goulet
 
02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department of
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
information technology they're actually
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
um representative edwards um to to
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%

02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:10.790 align:start position:0%
directly address your your comment in
question

02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
the uh there already is in statute
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
actually a strategic planning function
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
that's required by each agency it's
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
called the agency information technology
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
plan or aitp
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
could you get closer to the mind yes
 
02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:24.390 align:start position:0%
could you get closer to the mind yes
sorry

02:02:24.390 --> 02:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
we we do that on a biennial basis
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
aligned with the budget process so so my
 
02:02:33.270 --> 02:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
vision is and we've been working on um
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
that document over the years it's always
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
been required that the agency do it
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
we've sort of taken over responsibility
 
02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
in statute it says the agency needs to
 
02:02:45.669 --> 02:02:45.679 align:start position:0%
do it but i i require that our folks do
 
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
it we have in each agency we have an i.t
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
lead function
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner mary field and and i
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
just hired a new i.t lead for for
 
02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
for his organization which we're excited
 
02:02:58.950 --> 02:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
about because i believe we'll be able to
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
make a lot more progress than we have
 
02:03:02.790 --> 02:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
historically in that in the areas that
 
02:03:04.550 --> 02:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
that we're addressing and talking about
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
today but essentially what i expect is
 
02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
that and we also have an overall i.t
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
strategy function in fact
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
in early november we have a i.t council
 
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
meeting again a statutory body
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
i.t governance for the state of new
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire will be i expect will be
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
ratifying our updated strategic plan at
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
that time that's on the 5th of november
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
so my expectation is that an aitp or
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
agency information technology plan
 
02:03:35.109 --> 02:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
would accurately state what the
 
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
strategic citizen service and other
 
02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:39.750 align:start position:0%
strategic citizen service and other
requirements

02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
for the agency and that would roll up to
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
our strategic plan the overall statewide
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
strategic plan and it would align with
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
the budget requests that the agency is
 
02:03:50.719 --> 02:03:51.750 align:start position:0%
the budget requests that the agency is
making

02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
making
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up
 
02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
yes so so i i thank you for that uh
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh is is is the short story
 
02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
there that you think that the planning
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
mechanisms are now uh appropriate
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
and adequate so that we don't run into
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
these 20-year gaps again
 
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
well the um you know again i
 
02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know that
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know when i look i wasn't aware of
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
that finding from 99 so uh thanks for it
 
02:04:28.550 --> 02:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
educating me on that but
 
02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:29.430 align:start position:0%
educating me on that but
um

02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
the the fact remains that um
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know while we well we are not happy
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
we have an as400 there and we certainly
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
need to modernize it um we are running
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
the business on that and and and so it's
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
not um there's not any you know giant
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
problems with that other than it really
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
does need to be modernized
 
02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:52.470 align:start position:0%
does need to be modernized
um

02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
with our new it lead there and and one
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
of the things we've been doing is
 
02:04:59.430 --> 02:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
over the years that i've been here which
 
02:05:01.510 --> 02:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
is just now uh working on i don't want
 
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
to cut you off but i i will i was just
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
looking for a yes or no i think the
 
02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
procedures are now adequate so we're not
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
going to yeah i think having advanced
 
02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:11.350 align:start position:0%
going to yeah i think having advanced
the

02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
strategic planning function at
 
02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
department of labor and other agencies i
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
believe that we're we're doing a better
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
job than we ever have we will continue
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
to improve though you're never good
 
02:05:20.239 --> 02:05:21.910 align:start position:0%
to improve though you're never good
enough

02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative emrick you have a
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
question yes madam chair thank you
 
02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:31.990 align:start position:0%
question yes madam chair thank you
commissioner

02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
am i on
 
02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:37.830 align:start position:0%
am i on
no

02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:39.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:49.030 --> 02:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
there seemed to be a little push back
 
02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
about cyber security
 
02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:53.669 align:start position:0%
about cyber security
uh

02:05:53.669 --> 02:05:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
that and
 
02:05:57.669 --> 02:05:57.679 align:start position:0%
it seems to be a gap in understanding
 
02:05:57.679 --> 02:05:59.189 align:start position:0%
it seems to be a gap in understanding
that

02:05:59.189 --> 02:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
you're responsible for cyber cyber
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
security for the state
 
02:06:05.669 --> 02:06:05.679 align:start position:0%
are departments really responsible for
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
cyber security as well
 
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
well it is true that it's a shared
 
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility um
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
just for example when you when you look
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
at a ransomware attack in any successful
 
02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
ransomware attack in any um
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
in any organization it's typically an
 
02:06:22.709 --> 02:06:22.719 align:start position:0%
employee that clicked on the link you
 
02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
know so it's i think we all we do have a
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
shared responsibility
 
02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh the and i think it was pretty well
 
02:06:32.550 --> 02:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
explained um you know my
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
my response to the cyber security
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
finding um was um that i concurred in
 
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
part and it was mostly because i think
 
02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:41.270 align:start position:0%
part and it was mostly because i think
that

02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know when when when asked the
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
question you know what is your
 
02:06:47.830 --> 02:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
um cyber security strategic plan and how
 
02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
does it relate to how we're operating
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
inside the agencies we didn't have an
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
updated document on that so that's
 
02:06:54.629 --> 02:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
something that i've taken as an action
 
02:06:57.990 --> 02:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
item and you know to cure what what i
 
02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
didn't feel is that there is a material
 
02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:01.589 align:start position:0%
didn't feel is that there is a material
um

02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
problem with cyber security at the
 
02:07:06.069 --> 02:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
department of labor at this moment
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
and we have um
 
02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
we're applying pretty tight guidelines
 
02:07:12.310 --> 02:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
much tight you know a lot much tighter
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
than a lot of other states as it relates
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
to security and privacy in new hampshire
 
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
and we continue to work on that the
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
legislature's been great in
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
appropriating capital funds each time as
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
we request to keep up with our you know
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
our enemies frankly
 
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.350 align:start position:0%
uh so
so

02:07:29.350 --> 02:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know my my thought on this is that
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
we we need to
 
02:07:36.629 --> 02:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
update our now six-year-old cyber
 
02:07:38.229 --> 02:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
security strategy
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
and get that ratified by the i.t council
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
um and and continue to evolve our cyber
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
function in it and continue to um and
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
make it easier when a i think when the
 
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
auditors go into an agency to figure out
 
02:07:53.910 --> 02:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know what's going on there that we
 
02:07:58.229 --> 02:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:58.239 --> 02:07:59.910 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
my concern comes from whenever whenever
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
i hear the term we have shared
 
02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:05.350 align:start position:0%
i hear the term we have shared
responsibility

02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's like doubles in tennis
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
and we both watched the ball hit the
 
02:08:10.870 --> 02:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
strike between us
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
somebody has to be in charge i mean and
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm i think it's your i would be
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
looking to you to provide them guidance
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh and get on your train rather than
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
have two different trains yes i i agree
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
and and i will i will i will state that
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
i i'm the i'm responsible my
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
department's ultimately responsible for
 
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
the security of the data and systems in
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:41.990 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
questions

02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh mr merriweather i'm not going to let
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
you get by without
 
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
answering or talking about it or
 
02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:50.950 align:start position:0%
answering or talking about it or
whatever

02:08:50.950 --> 02:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for for what it's worth i
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
think senator d'alessandro
 
02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:55.669 align:start position:0%
think senator d'alessandro
oh

02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
02:08:58.950 --> 02:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
okay sorry
 
02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh my only comment you need to pull
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
the mic
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
is that better yes uh uh my only comment
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
would be that uh i really admired the
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
professionalism of the lba in this this
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
process uh as you might imagine for a
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
small agency it is a very difficult
 
02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:18.629 align:start position:0%
small agency it is a very difficult
process

02:09:18.629 --> 02:09:18.639 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
myself our cfo amy o'hara the deputy
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the uh rudy ogden who's
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
with us today and also the director of
 
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
the workers compensation division really
 
02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
we were the people
 
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
involved in providing data and
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
documentation to the lba for greater
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
than six months i think uh so it is uh
 
02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
a very in-depth process but they probed
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
our strengths as well as our weaknesses
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
made us aware of certain control
 
02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
situations that we we did not realize so
 
02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
as a very very good process for us and
 
02:09:59.430 --> 02:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
will help us grow as an agency and i'm
 
02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:00.629 align:start position:0%
will help us grow as an agency and i'm
grateful

02:10:00.629 --> 02:10:00.639 align:start position:0%
grateful
 
02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
i do have one
 
02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
i know the audit identified
 
02:10:15.030 --> 02:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
some legislative action
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
make the change
 
02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh we have not we have made similar
 
02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
changes because
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
when the legislature in 2011
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
created the restricted fund there were
 
02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
several vestigial statutes just like
 
02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:36.229 align:start position:0%
several vestigial statutes just like
this

02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:10:39.270 --> 02:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh some of those four i believe four of
 
02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
those statutes were directing funds not
 
02:10:44.790 --> 02:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
to the restricted fund but to dedicated
 
02:10:48.310 --> 02:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
funds so in the review of uh
 
02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:51.030 align:start position:0%
funds so in the review of uh
uh

02:10:51.030 --> 02:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:53.109 --> 02:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds we discovered that that
 
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
was changed in house bill 4 in the last
 
02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:58.069 align:start position:0%
was changed in house bill 4 in the last
biennium

02:10:58.069 --> 02:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
but we did not realize that this one
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
still existed
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
um so we'll we will seek
 
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
legislative change i'm not exactly sure
 
02:11:09.189 --> 02:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
when the senate closes
 
02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
the 27th
 
02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:11.910 align:start position:0%
the 27th
so

02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
i think you can just
 
02:11:16.149 --> 02:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
go to one of the senators and
 
02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
say this is an audit finding
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
you know will you submit this so sure
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
there are 24 of them and i'm sure
 
02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
any one of them would be more than happy
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
to uh to take care of this excellent we
 
02:11:32.550 --> 02:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
will do that okay
 
02:11:35.910 --> 02:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
other is are there any other
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:39.669 align:start position:0%
questions um
obviously

02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:11:42.629 --> 02:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
this audit sparked a lot of interest
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
on the part of the
 
02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
so um i definitely want to thank
 
02:11:52.870 --> 02:11:52.880 align:start position:0%

the department of education come back
 
02:12:52.709 --> 02:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
here on october 1st
 
02:12:54.390 --> 02:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
and give us an update on the voucher
 
02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
plan now i don't see the commissioner
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
here uh i don't know who's here from the
 
02:13:00.550 --> 02:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
department of education that's going to
 
02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
bring that report to us
 
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%

02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
that that report was due on the 1st of
 
02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:08.950 align:start position:0%
