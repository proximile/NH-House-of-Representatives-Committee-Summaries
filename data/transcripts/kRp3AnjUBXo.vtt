00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
did we finish with 275 or are we waiting

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
okay because i see it for some reason
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
it's not on the work session schedule
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%

00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
think what we're doing was we're coming
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:33.350 align:start position:0%

with uh 430 that mclean amendment
 
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:51.030 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:20.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.590 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
i had wanted to talk about this
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
amendment yesterday but i needed to talk
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
to the clerk to make sure i understood
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
when uh an amendment is germaine and
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
when it's not germaine and and and the
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
debate or the reason that's an important
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh distinction
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
is because if it's not germaine we've
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
got to schedule a separate hearing under
 
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.150 align:start position:0%
got to schedule a separate hearing under
it

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
as it turns out
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
the clerk informs me that this this
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
amendment is germane
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
this is essentially intended to
 
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.030 align:start position:0%
this is essentially intended to
authorize

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
authorize
 
00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.870 align:start position:0%
authorize
uh

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
the the the additional words that would
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
be added to rsa 151 colon 2-f
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
the additional words would be that
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
unless the facility operates on a
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
membership basis model or exclusively
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
provides services to individuals
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
who make direct payment for services for
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
purposes of this paragraph a direct
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
payment is one that is paid directly by
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
the patient so so this is an attempt to
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
introduce a little bit more free market
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
flexibility into our health care system
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
this was uh uh
 
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.870 align:start position:0%
this was uh uh
originally

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
originally
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
house bill one zero
 
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.190 align:start position:0%
house bill one zero
four

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
it passed the house
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
i don't have the vote of the of that
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
house vote but it did pass the house
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
it went over to the senate uh the senate
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
took it and decided to
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
at the request of representative mclean
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
who is the prime sponsor and
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative osborne
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
they're asking division three to
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
consider this for inclusion into 4 430
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
that that that's essentially the
 
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.870 align:start position:0%
that that that's essentially the
background

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.870 align:start position:0%
background
um

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
is is there anyone here who can speak to
 
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
this bill mr williams are you prepared
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
or or could you tap dance or is there
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
anyone else that would be more qualified
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
chairman edwards thank you for the
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
record john williams the director of
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs for health human
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
services and the department was
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
monitoring the bill that you spoke of in
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
the senate that went to interim study we
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
did not provide testimony on that bill
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
and so i really don't have much more to
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
offer around that other than some of the
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
testimony as to why i was put into
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
interim study was general concerns
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
around access to health care and what
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
that could do relative to
 
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.269 align:start position:0%
that could do relative to
a

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
facilities being able to allow to
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
operate outside of the specialty
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
healthcare licensure
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
by virtue of being a direct pay
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
entity and that's pretty much totality
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
what i think it can offer to the
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
committee i don't know if there's others
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
in the audience who would like to
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
provide you with information
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
do you do you recall any of the
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
testimony over on the house side that
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
my general recollection was uh the the
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
house obviously passed this and this was
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
the house position um are very close to
 
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:41.490 align:start position:0%
the house position do you recall uh
 
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.790 align:start position:0%
the house position do you recall uh
[Music]

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.750 align:start position:0%
[Music]
so

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm thinking is is there anyone else
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
in the audience able to speak to this
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
bill thank you mr williams uh ms minahan
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative paula minnehan
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
hospital association we did oppose this
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
bill in the in the house we opposed it
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
um last year when it was
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
introduced as well this is a little
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
different um
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
because mclean's bill actually was
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
combined um so 1044 was actually
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
combined with a membership-based
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
business model which was language that
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
came out of representative cushman's
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
bill and then it was combined and um
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
amended in the house i don't recall the
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
vote in the house committee to be honest
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
i think it probably was under um
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
probably party lines 11 to 10
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
or 12 to 10. um and greg moore from um
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
america's for prosperity supported the
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
bill and we strongly oppose it for the
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
reasons that representative excuse me
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
john williams um indicated um this could
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
impact access to services certainly for
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
our critical access hospitals was the
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
concern one of the concerns but it's
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
bypassing the requirement to all um
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
institut are all facilities to have a
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
charity care policy
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
um and that was a concern because that
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
means that you would not also not have
 
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.350 align:start position:0%
means that you would not also not have
to

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
accept medicare or medicaid services
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me reimbursement so that's our
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
concern and it's um something that has
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
not been done anywhere else in the
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
country um this is i think modeled after
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
direct primary care which has some
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
some certainly legitimacy relative to
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
and that those are my terms
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
relative to direct services for
 
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.230 align:start position:0%
relative to direct services for
physicians

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
or practitioners providing care but this
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
would be facilities um with a direct
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
prime with direct
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
membership based and that was our
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
concern that is means that
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
hospitals are required to take all
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
comers and we don't understand how this
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
would work if if they have an emergency
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
room would they
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
refuse care of individuals
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
so that would be a concern to us as well
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to share our testimony i
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
can i can email it to folks but we are
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
we strongly oppose the bill and um
 
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.990 align:start position:0%
we strongly oppose the bill and um
um

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.790 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
that's our position is there anyone
 
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.509 align:start position:0%
that's our position is there anyone
would

00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
stay there just second is there is
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
anyone here who can speak in favor of
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
cares to speak in favor of this bill
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
the way it was described to me is that
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
this is opposed by the hospitals because
 
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.910 align:start position:0%
this is opposed by the hospitals because
um

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
it enables
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
additional competition to the hospitals
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
which is a cynical thing but i just
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
thought i'd put the cynical thing on the
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
table sure um we're not opposed to
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
competition we're opposed to
 
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.269 align:start position:0%
competition we're opposed to
um

00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
impeding access to care for the
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
vulnerable individuals and we believe
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
that this could have that effect
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
and we don't believe state state the
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
state should have a law that um supports
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
that position because
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
um they obviously support coverage for
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
individuals through medicaid and this
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
would bypass that so that's our that was
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
i remember being in another's discussion
 
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.429 align:start position:0%
i remember being in another's discussion
before

00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
but the point
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
being made is the regular hospitals that
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
do provide emergency services etc
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
all have huge
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
discounts on property taxes and business
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
taxes and meals and rooms taxes that
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
amount to millions of dollars
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
and these
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
private type things would not
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the reasons since
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
that you're getting all the tax breaks
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
at the hospitals that's the reason why
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
because we're asking you to
 
00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.669 align:start position:0%
because we're asking you to
provide

00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:52.950 align:start position:0%
provide
service

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
and quite often it's it's the board of
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
directors that decides how much but
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
anyway that's just what i've heard in
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
the past on these thank you
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
all right uh are there any other
 
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.350 align:start position:0%
all right uh are there any other
questions

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
um i'm gonna call a five-minute recess
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
so that we can caucus on this
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
i didn't i didn't think we were going to
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
be able to do this today so some of the
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
prior prep hasn't been done
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're ready when you are but there's no
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
hurry if you're not done with your
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
discussion we can wait
 
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.350 align:start position:0%
discussion we can wait
okay

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
okay so we just completed uh less than
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
five minute recess i think so that we
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
could caucus on um
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
amendment 1742
 
00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:54.230 align:start position:0%
amendment 1742
um

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
and so is there a motion
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure the right motion is to make
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
but i'd move that we
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
include amendment 20221742h
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
to sb430
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
moved is that second and then seconded
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
um is there a discussion in your move so
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
effectively that's an otp on this as an
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
amendment to 430 that's what i'm hearing
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
i if this is the only amendment to 430
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
then i'd be moving otpa i guess i'm just
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
not sure if we're done with 430 at this
 
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.630 align:start position:0%
not sure if we're done with 430 at this
point

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we are but we can
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
move on this solitary amendment and then
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
if there are others we can do those also
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
they're not so i guess i'm moving to
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
recommend otpa on 430 with amendment
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
number 2022-1742h
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
all right is there a discussion
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
well i'm i'm going to vote no on this
 
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.230 align:start position:0%
well i'm i'm going to vote no on this
because

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
first of all it's the first thing first
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
time i've heard about it this morning
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
that we were going to uh try to include
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
it here
 
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.110 align:start position:0%
it here
and

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
you know the senate does have it i
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
believe i
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
saw that they have an interim study
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
and it feels to me like this is
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
something that needs a little deeper
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
dive than i can do this morning
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
when i've only had like a
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
10 minute warning so
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am everything you just said is uh
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
um i would i would just say that uh
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
if we uh do adopt this amendment uh
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to get another bite at the
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
apple at three o'clock tomorrow when the
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
full committee hears the
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
our recommendations so
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
it's it it's not quite over but every
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
every point you made is valid
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
and and i apologize for that i i just
 
00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.390 align:start position:0%
and and i apologize for that i i just
couldn't

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
get a response from the clerk fast
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
enough to know whether or not i should
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
be sending this out to everyone and
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
getting you all excited about something
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
that may not be
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
even something we could consider
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
okay so although the uh testimony we
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
heard was opposed and negative to this
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
the way i read this is that we're
 
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.390 align:start position:0%
the way i read this is that we're
um

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.190 align:start position:0%
um
we're

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.909 align:start position:0%
trying to
establish

00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
establish
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
an alternative health care capability
 
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
that is membership based or relies on
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
the direct payment for services and what
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
we're saying is in order to encourage
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
and support an alternative health care
 
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.669 align:start position:0%
and support an alternative health care
model

00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
model
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
that what we're saying is that they
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
would not be
 
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.350 align:start position:0%
would not be
immediately

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.630 align:start position:0%
immediately
subject

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
subject
 
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.830 align:start position:0%
subject
to

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
the provision that's in law that they
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
have to provide services to all persons
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
so they
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
so they're just looking to be able to
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
service their members
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%

i'm gonna i'm gonna vote in favor but uh
 
00:23:53.679 --> 00:23:54.630 align:start position:0%

if there is no other conversation uh mr
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.630 align:start position:0%
 
1742

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
1742
 
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.310 align:start position:0%
1742
h

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%

00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
chairman edwards yes
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair the vote is four to three ah
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so now
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
we have to do an
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
administrative thing
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
in order for us to meet the clerk's
 
00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:03.029 align:start position:0%
in order for us to meet the clerk's
rules

00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
literally and precisely
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
all the way down to the comma identical
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
to what the house passed
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
and this version
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
um this amendment missed a comma
 
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.750 align:start position:0%
um this amendment missed a comma
between

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
the phrase any person and starting in
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
the bold where it says unless the
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
facility is that is that accurate mr
 
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.470 align:start position:0%
facility is that is that accurate mr
ripple

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
ripple
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
yes it is so uh so i think we need a a
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
separate vote
 
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
to and i'm not sure how we would phrase
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
this but i would want to
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
allow you to go get that comma fixed
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
and that we would have we would have
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
already voted that we we want to approve
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
the version with the comma in there
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's fine and if you want
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
to just do a show of hands on that vote
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
i think that would work okay so show of
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
hands if
 
00:25:56.799 --> 00:25:57.590 align:start position:0%
hands if
uh

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
when mr ripple gets the comma inserted
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
in the appropriate place to make this
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
identical to hb one zero four four
 
00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:06.950 align:start position:0%
identical to hb one zero four four
um

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
will you accept that amendment in lieu
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%

00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
this yesterday and the only change that
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
you requested was you wanted to make the
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 2.8 million lapsing and
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%

00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
skimming this looking for where we make
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
it so that the funds are lapsing and i'm
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
section roman seven you had language
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
specifically say stating that it would
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
not lapse and by removing that it would
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
lapse okay thank you for that
 
00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:55.110 align:start position:0%

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
passes 7-0
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
so we're done with with that amendment
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
what what's the next one on the carousel
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
you talked yesterday
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
about deleting section six which is just
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
relative to a reporting requirement um
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
section 6 of the bill as it stands now
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
would remove the provisions saying that
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
this report shall be submitted annually
 
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
thereafter so you want to keep this as
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
an annual report so you would just
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
so amendment
 
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
1783 to
 
00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.350 align:start position:0%
1783 to
sb430

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
sb430
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
serves the purpose of keeping the
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
family planning services annual report
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
as an annual report rather than deleting
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
the requirement to
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
complete the report annually
 
00:31:29.919 --> 00:31:30.710 align:start position:0%
complete the report annually
so

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
i think we discussed this uh yesterday
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
do we have a motion
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
yes i would
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
move we recommend adoption of amendment
 
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.789 align:start position:0%
move we recommend adoption of amendment
20221783h

00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
to sp430 sure second
 
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.190 align:start position:0%
to sp430 sure second
second

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay this it's now open for discussion
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
the discussion should be whether or not
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
you think we ought to continue to get

okay um
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
i i want to do
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
the roll call just because
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
i i don't remember exactly what the deal
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
was but i got ourselves uh off step by
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
taking uh hand votes when they wanted a
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
documented roll call so i just don't
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
want to with the
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
there is no time for a mistake at this
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
point so
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
we have one more on 4 30. you have one
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
more um
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
i'll hand this out this is a department
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
request it amends section 29 of the bill
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
and section 29
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
removes a reference to the anna phil
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
brook center and this will replace it
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
with a reference to hampstead hospital
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
did did we discuss it at all yesterday
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
all right so this is this is a little
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
bit of a surprise but as far as
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:35.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you mr williams
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
and and my question is
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
um are we getting over our skis a little
 
00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:44.629 align:start position:0%
um are we getting over our skis a little
bit

00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
siding hampstead hospital when as i
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
understand it that deal is not
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
uh chairman edwards for the record john
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
williams legislative uh director for the
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
department of health and services and
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
with me is uh joe curisti chief
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
financial officer for new hampshire
 
00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.589 align:start position:0%
financial officer for new hampshire
hospital

00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
and uh chairman edward thank you very
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
much for preparing this amendment at the
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
request of the department we are
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
actually on on going through the process
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
right now to identify contracting
 
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.670 align:start position:0%
right now to identify contracting
for

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
certain rate settings with commercial
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
private insurers very much like we do
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
under the current statute current law as
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
it relates to new hampshire hospital and
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
glencliff home so this is really a belt
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
and suspenders amendment that's being
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
requested by the department because the
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
bill currently has provision where the
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
in philbrook center no longer is
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
utilized for children's behavioral
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
health services and it already has a
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
catch-all for other entities that are in
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
the state mental health system but our
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
wonderful general legal counsel frank
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
nachman identified the potential for a
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
belt and suspenders request
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
that where the anaphil berk has been
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
struck we are moving into negotiations
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh contracting around rate setting with
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
the commercial private insurers um that
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
we just want to make sure that we
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
include hampstead hospital specifically
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
as an entity in addition to that mr
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
christie who's with me here today also
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
identified because we're just looking at
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
this one specific statute to making a
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
change uh to that because this is that
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
statute that deals with the contracting
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
authority that uh mr christie identified
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
that we want to limit the scope of our
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
universe to the state-owned uh
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
facilities so that's the only change
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
that we're requesting for this
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
particular section and these
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
conversations are going on as we speak i
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
understand so i'm gonna have mr christie
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
please either add or correct anything i
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
might have mistakes so in an interesting
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
time let me let me just say back what i
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
think i heard you say and then mr
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
christie can uh uh you know extend or
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
revise my remarks okay what i what i
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
think i heard is that we're doing the
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
obvious thing we're getting we're taking
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
the and phil brook center out because
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
we're no longer negotiating rates for
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
them and although we don't yet
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh have the hampstead hospital in our
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
constellation of state-owned facilities
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
where they're nevertheless trying to get
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
ahead of the curve and doing the rate
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
negotiation now
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
and we don't actually have any current
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
authority to do those contract
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
negotiations unless we pass this bill is
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
is that is that fair
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
um do you have anything else you'd like
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
to say about this
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
no thank you for your consideration all
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
right thank you uh do i have a motion
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes i move we recommend adopting
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
amendment number two zero two two dash
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
one seven zero one h two s p four thirty
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
representing bean seconds is there any
 
00:37:53.359 --> 00:37:56.790 align:start position:0%
representing bean seconds is there any
discussion

00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
i guess i should have asked this of john
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
williams but
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
if we didn't include
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
hampstead hospital
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
what what problems would that
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
could have what what are the problems
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
that could occur if you don't mind that
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
i asked them i no i think that's fine
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
once you come on up i i i'm going to try
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
to guess the lawyer part and just say
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
that uh we don't have the authority to
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
negotiate commercial rates uh
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
until we own the facility and this
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
allows that commercial rate negotiation
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
to go by in a binding way
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
is that close
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
that is um accurate that is from frank
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
nachman who's our chief legal counsel
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
from the department who confirmed that
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
we do need to have this legislative
 
00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.349 align:start position:0%
we do need to have this legislative
change

00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
for being able to do what we otherwise
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
were able to do with the anna feldberg
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
center and mr christie anything else ad
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
i i would just add that this um
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
the notion of our general counsel uh
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
thinking of this actually came from us
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
working on trying to negotiate rates for
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
hampstead hospital
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
glad to have a follow-up so the the
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
words in here that say other state-owned
 
00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:09.270 align:start position:0%
words in here that say other state-owned
facilities

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully i i believe that it does
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
however belts and suspenders being what
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
it is and our chief legal counsel did
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
make the request for us to proceed to
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
further clarifying that uh the hampstead
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
hospital could be included in the
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
legislation on only this specific
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
section you'll see throughout uh senate
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
bill uh central 430 there are other
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
references for cleanup that we're not
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
touching today that just used the
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
broader language moving forward
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
so mr williams follow up on that
 
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
today or today
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
hampstead hospital is not
 
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
a state-owned facility is that
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
correct or wrong
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
okay so today if we want to negotiate
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
commercial rates
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
we have to specifically include them in
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
the language otherwise they would not be
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
included is that
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
yes i think that's a fair assessment
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay okay so based on that
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
should we put a separate sub
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
effective date for this paragraph
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
or or does 430 just say upon signature
 
00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
of the governor anyways
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
i would defer to mr ripple just that's a
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
great question uh what the effective
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
date is for section 29 i think this
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
might have been one upon passage but i
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
just don't have the effective dates in
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
front of me and similarly is there any
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
wisdom or any legal ability for us to
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
retroactively make this effective as of
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know a month or two ago because the
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
negotiation started a month or two ago i
 
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.430 align:start position:0%
negotiation started a month or two ago i
suspect

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
suspect
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
is you're nodding your head mr christie
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
is that does that make sense to try to
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
make it retroactive if that's legal
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
i think that would make sense we
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
certainly started these conversations
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
over the past six weeks or so so what if
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
we could make it retroactive what date
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think april first would be fine
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
april fool's my favorite uh mr ripple um
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
so it is currently effective upon
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
passage and i'm not sure i've ever seen
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
a retroactive effective date before on a
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
bill so i'm not sure that that's
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
something you would want to attempt
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
more of that crazy out of the box
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
thinking so uh so i'll leave that alone
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
and assume that the people negotiating
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
want the negotiations to be binding
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
anyway so we don't need the extra
 
00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.069 align:start position:0%
anyway so we don't need the extra
detail

00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
detail
 
00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:45.109 align:start position:0%
detail
okay

00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh were we still in discussion do you
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
have more follow-up go ahead one one
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
more one more question so if the deal
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
what does this have any would this have
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
any um
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
obligation for the state if we had
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
included it here and the deal fell
 
00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.150 align:start position:0%
included it here and the deal fell
through

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead take a job
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so um i think if the
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
deal were to fall through the state
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
would have no
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
authority to set rates for dams or for
 
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
hampstead hospital or real no purpose to
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
do so
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
not not seeing any i think we've
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
completed the discussion and we're ready
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%

on uh 4 30 uh for today um
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
we probably need to write a blurb on
 
00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.589 align:start position:0%
we probably need to write a blurb on
this

00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
is there is there a requirement for a
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
blurb well there is right
 
00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.589 align:start position:0%
blurb well there is right
yes

00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
any anyone enthusiastic about writing
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
now we'll find somebody
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
we will have to describe what each
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
separate amendment did
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
just the amendments not the whole bill
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
is is that the case no you will say you
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
know the committee voted in favor and
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
you describe what the bill does and then
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
say that this amendment changes this
 
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
this all right change that you'll write
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative will uh write that
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh did you have a question i do have a
 
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.510 align:start position:0%
uh did you have a question i do have a
question

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
so tomorrow when we um come to this bill
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
there will be and that one opera there
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
will be another opportunity to amend it
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
i i will make sure that in particular
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
you have an opportunity to talk through
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
the membership based amendment do you
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
want to talk to all of them or
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
specifically to that one no just that
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
one so i i will i will make sure that uh
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
we we take a fresh look in the full
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee on that okay i want to think
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
through what the process is though to
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
exclu to get that out of the bill let's
 
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
say that's what i want to do is to take
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
you won't because the motion tomorrow
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
would be ought to pass as amended and
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
you would take separate votes on each
 
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
amendment uh so you would have it again
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay tomorrow so we can just vote no on
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
that amendment right tomorrow
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
right right
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you no problem and to tie it into
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
a side conversation you may have heard
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
snippets of
 
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:31.750 align:start position:0%
snippets of
it

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
it had been recommended to me to try to
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
make this the form of a a trailer bill
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
format so that we could
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
add and subtract particular clauses
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
without having to redo the whole thing
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
and as mr ripple has
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
educated me it's effectively already
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
that way because we're handling these
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
amendments separately is that correct
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
okay i'm representing weiler
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
could i ask mr ripple
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
is it five total amendments
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
four amendments
 
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.870 align:start position:0%
four amendments
okay

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
all right which one am i mistaken on
 
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
1778 1783
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
1701 yeah
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
and 1742 with the addition of a comma
 
00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
i had it down twice thank you
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
such a good it was such a good amendment
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
do it twice
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh i think i think we're done
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
discussing 430 um
 
00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:50.839 align:start position:0%
so so let's go
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
mr ripple as i recall the amendment we
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
were going to ask
 
00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.630 align:start position:0%
were going to ask
was

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
on line eight
 
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.549 align:start position:0%
on line eight
the

00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
term and non-public
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
was was added
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
and it looks like we added at the bottom
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
on line 19 into 20
 
00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
the governor may remove any
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
non-legislative member with or without
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
cause that's that's what you requested
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
yep and i do have that amendment yeah
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
and and i think i for some reason i
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
think i already have it uh but is it uh
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
one seven seven five
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
it is and you know i think i handed it
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
out at the end of the day yesterday so i
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
have spare copies if anybody needs one
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay and then we also
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
does the amendment technically added a
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph w
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
because there's a v and then a w is
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
that's just like a little renumbering
 
00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:59.829 align:start position:0%
that's just like a little renumbering
thing

00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.839 --> 00:49:12.549 align:start position:0%
 
w

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:12.559 --> 00:49:18.630 align:start position:0%
 
275.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
okay so in summary we're going to uh
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
pull up an amendment to sb 275 that was
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh partially discussed yesterday the
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
part that we discussed was the inclusion
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
of the phrase and non-public to
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
expand upon the idea that this support
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
is intended for public
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
school programs and also the non-public
 
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.150 align:start position:0%
school programs and also the non-public
ones

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
ones
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
the part that we did not discuss i don't
 
00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:45.750 align:start position:0%
the part that we did not discuss i don't
believe

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
is the last sentence that says the
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
governor may remove any non-legislative
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
member with or without cause
 
00:49:53.359 --> 00:49:54.549 align:start position:0%
member with or without cause
um

00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
that seems to me to make sense because
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
if if anyone gets arrested for
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
something horrible
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
it may be necessary for the good of the
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
reputation of the advisory commission to
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
be able to remove an individual
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
such as that
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know for example if somebody got
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
arrested you know dealing opioids it
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
would be good to get them off of the
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
opioid commission
 
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.069 align:start position:0%
opioid commission
um

00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
so uh so that that's the general purpose
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
so so we can take a motion and if
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
there's a second we can discuss it
 
00:50:31.119 --> 00:50:33.670 align:start position:0%
there's a second we can discuss it
further

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
i would move
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh amendment number 2022-1775h
 
00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.750 align:start position:0%
uh amendment number 2022-1775h
to

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
that we recommend that amendment to it
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative bean
 
00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:56.470 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative bean
discussion

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to specifically ask you
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
what's your reaction to the addition of
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
the power of the governor to remove a
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
commission member
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
i i think i'm fine if you said with
 
00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.589 align:start position:0%
i i think i'm fine if you said with
cause

00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
cause
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
but the without cause
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
is concerning to me because it seems
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
like that could get very political
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
sure sure i didn't mean it to be
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
political i just meant that i i wanted
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
if the governor were to do it i didn't
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
want to have to evolve involve some
 
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.030 align:start position:0%
want to have to evolve involve some
legal

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.309 align:start position:0%
legal
process

00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
to show cause um that that's why i did
 
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
that but if you'd be happier with the
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
striking or without
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't i don't have a real concern
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
about it i was just trying to make sure
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
we didn't end up in a big hr protracted
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
well i mean i just saw this but what
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
strikes me about it is the without cause
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
um i mean with cause if someone is
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
picked up for dwi
 
00:51:58.559 --> 00:52:00.230 align:start position:0%
picked up for dwi
or

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
using drugs or something i guess that
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
would be cause i don't know who
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
determines what causes either it it
 
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
would be the governor
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's why it would be
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
flexible um
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
without question really bothers me
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
because it seems like that could turn
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
into a political thing is it is there
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
any other thought on that
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah you agree representative
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
nordgren how about you representative
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
i also agree i i believe there's already
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
cause if somebody's sitting on a drug
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
task force and they get arrested for
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
dealing drugs i i think there's already
 
00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:35.990 align:start position:0%
dealing drugs i i think there's already
a

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh policy with which they could
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
be put off that so yeah i would agree
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
with the uh removing without with cost
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
you're okay with cause right okay
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
so uh any other discussion on on that i
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
i i'm open to
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
deleting or without
 
00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.109 align:start position:0%
deleting or without
um

00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
just you know because i
 
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully it'll never happen to begin
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
with but uh
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
but i just don't want anyone to think
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
man ask me a question uh yes go ahead
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative can we do that without
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
getting another rewritten amendment or
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
you could you could adopt the amendment
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
remove my i mean withdraw my my motion
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
and make a new one
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
just keep it clean yes sir
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
so i would move
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
adoption of amendment number two zero
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
two two dash one seven seven five h to
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
sp 275
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
with the removal of the words with or
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
with without cause at the end of the
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
piece amending section seven
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
but we i think we intend to keep the the
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
words worth calling sorry thank you or
 
00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
with excuse me
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
rewording those last few words
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
removal of or without cause
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
no no remove or without
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
just with cause
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%

or without the two words or or without
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%

00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
from amendment one seven seven five
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%

okay thank you
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
which takes us to 416.
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
i i think there's an amendment there
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
that you've not yet passed out that's
 
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
so yesterday you considered an amendment
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
to remove section 3 entirely
 
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:45.589 align:start position:0%
to remove section 3 entirely
and

00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
you ultimately decided to ask for
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
another amendment to leave section 3 in
 
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
place but add the words
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
if a functional behavioral assessment
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
exists for the student so that's the
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
which bill are we doing now
 
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay just just to
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
i guess restate
 
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.430 align:start position:0%
i guess restate
what

00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
mr ripple just said
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
does something very narrow
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
it seems to comply with the intent that
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
we heard in testimony yesterday that
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
they aren't looking to create a new
 
00:58:55.119 --> 00:58:56.390 align:start position:0%
they aren't looking to create a new
requirement

00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
for a functional behavioral assessment
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
if there isn't one when it's time to be
 
00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.109 align:start position:0%
if there isn't one when it's time to be
considered

00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
by not making it
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
a new requirement
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
we dealt with the financial aspect
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
i had been concerned going into it if we
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
were creating an unfunded mandate and so
 
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:16.630 align:start position:0%
were creating an unfunded mandate and so
that

00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
easily took care of my concern
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
so um so that's that's all i think this
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
amendment does
 
00:59:24.079 --> 00:59:24.950 align:start position:0%
amendment does
um

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:59:26.079 --> 00:59:28.549 align:start position:0%
is there
emotion

00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
emotion
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
excuse me i would move that we adopt or
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
that the committee adopt
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
uh amendment of
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
2022-1786-h to
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
sb 416.
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
excuse me again what you say the
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
amendment does uh
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
but what it does yeah it okay it's just
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
sprays here if a behavioral assessment
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
exists for the student
 
00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.270 align:start position:0%
exists for the student
and

00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
and the reason this was important
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
is because yeah otherwise it's it read
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
like everyone would have to do one for
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
every piece of
 
01:00:02.559 --> 01:00:03.910 align:start position:0%
every piece of
okay

01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
okay so is there a second to the motion
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative bean
 
01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.470 align:start position:0%
representative bean
seconds

01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any discussion um
 
01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any discussion um
so

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:21.570 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:24.230 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
you got so much writing to do there mr
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
clerk so but when you're ready we'll be
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
patient when you're ready we'll we can
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
do a roll call on this
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
um you know let's because we're going to
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
have to do roll call on the otpa let's
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
just do a show of hands on this
 
01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:38.710 align:start position:0%
just do a show of hands on this
amendment

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
there we go so show of hands if you
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
approve of this amendment that looks to
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
be seven to nothing
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
so so now i need a mo
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
now i need a motion on ot
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
i would move otpa
 
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
with that amendment i would move we
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
recommend otpa with amendment number two
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
zero two two dash one seven eight six h
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
on to sb four one six is that second i'm
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
sorry before you take that vote could i
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
just mention one thing i just want i
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
wanna make sure
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
it it comes up so the other issue that
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
you discussed yesterday was the
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
possibility of a state cost
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i emailed you all
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
an email provided by rebecca ross of the
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
department that showed a state cost of
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
725 000 in fiscal 24 and 1.5 1.4 million
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
and 25 so i just wanted to make sure you
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
all had that and were aware of it before
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
you voted on the bill
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
all right give me those figures again
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
you have a copy of the email can can we
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
just share a copy of the email because
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
i'll get them in the record okay
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh 725 000 in fiscal 24
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
and 1.4 million in fiscal 25.
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
i think we have a motion and a second
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
and so is there any further discussion
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
if if anyone would like to discuss the
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers that mr ripple just shared
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
i i have a question for for you mr
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
ripple or maybe somebody in the crowd
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
by inserting the phrase if a functional
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
behavioral assessment exists for the
 
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.750 align:start position:0%
behavioral assessment exists for the
student

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's not requiring a new one to be done
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm just wondering
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
where the these what the what's driving
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
these costs
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
i think that amendment addresses any
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
potential local cost however there's a
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
state cost created by sections one and
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
two and i think uh
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
miss ross would be better
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
better situated to answer that than i
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
would okay so we're we're talking about
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
the body the bill again not the
 
01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.069 align:start position:0%
the body the bill again not the
amendment

01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
okay is ross do you do you want to
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
remind us of what you probably said
 
01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:10.390 align:start position:0%
remind us of what you probably said
yesterday

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
members of the committee rebecca ross
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
the director of the bureau for
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health when we
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
discussed this yesterday we talked about
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment resolving any question
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
that there would be additional costs
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
through the educational system in the
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
local school districts
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
but the the body of the bill requires
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
that if an fba has not been done in the
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
school context and there is one needed
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
for a youth who's at risk of residential
 
01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.630 align:start position:0%
for a youth who's at risk of residential
placement

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
placement
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
either through the bureau of children's
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
behavioral health or dcyf that dhhs
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
obtaining that fba and in order to do
 
01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.109 align:start position:0%
obtaining that fba and in order to do
that

01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
we came up with these numbers for the
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
six months from january 1 in 2024 and a
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
full year
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
in the second year and 25.
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay i know you did this yesterday but
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
would you remind us
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
this is the cost of doing an fba would
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
you would you just uh
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
trip through a couple of benefits and
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
what the financial implication may be of
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
the benefits of having an fba available
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
sure the the
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
if an individual is going into
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
residential treatment as a result of the
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
their behavior in at home or in the
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
community and an fba can be used to
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
address and come up with a plan for
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
those behavioral challenges the goal
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
would be to reduce or eliminate the need
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
for residential treatment including
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
out-of-state residential treatment
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
the goal of doing it when they are at
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
risk of going into residential would be
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
doing it earlier so that we're not
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
waiting to treat them in a residential
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
setting so by spending 10 to 15 hours at
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
approximately 400 an hour to have the
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate professional do the
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
functional behavioral assessment and
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
have a corresponding treatment plan that
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
works with all of the other elements of
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
the system of care
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
including the cans assessment and the
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
cat tool for
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
determining the appropriate level of
 
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
residential treatment we would then take
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
that information
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
to meet the child's treatment needs and
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
reduce the need for expensive care
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
either residentially or out of state
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
so um i have a follow-up for you
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
and and this and this is probably
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of used to seeing cost-benefit
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
analysis and and i'm seeing the cost
 
01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.829 align:start position:0%
analysis and and i'm seeing the cost
analysis

01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
a benefit analysis would inform us
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
whether or not it would be possible to
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
actually reduce our net costs because
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
as a benefit to having the information
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm just curious in your professional
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
opinion do you think this is
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
incremental cost addition or do you
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
think once we
 
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
factor in the benefit of having this
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
information earlier that we may actually
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
avoid costs and end up in a
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
a you know financially a positive
 
01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.670 align:start position:0%
a you know financially a positive
situation

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
i think this combined with the other
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
initiatives of the children's system of
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
care we will absolutely
 
01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:19.430 align:start position:0%
care we will absolutely
see

01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
over time a reduction in the higher
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
expenditures which will overall reduce
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
costs i think that we won't see that
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
until we we have it in place and have it
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the residential and
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
community based treatment programs so
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
initially there will be that added cost
 
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
the five to ten year will certainly this
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
will contribute to decreases in costs of
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
residential and long-term care
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
so so what i would appreciate you
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about is if i get invited back
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
next year to have anything to do with
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
dhhs budgeting i if you could make sure
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
to remind us
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
if you have more better information
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
about the cost-benefit side of this i i
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
just would like to hear it as an update
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely i think what is difficult is
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
with all of the changes that we're
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
making to reflect the outcome from one
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
particular change it's more of the
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
system-wide change and this is a key
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
piece of that i totally believe you uh
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
are there uh representative walner
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
yes uh from a question for miss ross um
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
does this also include children in the
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely so all children who were
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
going into residential treatment
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
or at risk of now we've we've taken out
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
of the numbers those that have an autism
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
spectrum diagnosis that would be covered
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
with by medicaid those that had already
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
had one through the schools so we've
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
tried to narrow it down to those who
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
anywhere in this system would be
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
accessing residential but don't
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise have one provided for them
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
and we have we we have a motion in a
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
second on an otpa i believe um
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%

so i think we've uh completed action on
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
sb 416 is that correct
 
01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.349 align:start position:0%
sb 416 is that correct
that's

01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh do we have anyone wanting to write
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
the committee report uh representative
 
01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.510 align:start position:0%
the committee report uh representative
walner

01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
walner
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
and then all these reports were
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
i think the real answer is it should be
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
done before three o'clock tomorrow but
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
the sooners the better
 
01:09:09.199 --> 01:09:10.309 align:start position:0%
the sooners the better
um

01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
we did 4 30 we did 4 44 yesterday
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
we did um 4 58 yesterday
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
that brings us down to our last item of
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
business which is uh sb 459 mr ripple
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
did we get the amendment
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
no um and i'm not sure when it will be
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
back i do expect it back today but i
 
01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
didn't leave it with ols until around 11
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
o'clock and i think it might take them
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
what what is on the calendar for
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning for finance i i know
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
that uh representative umberger doesn't
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
but i i don't have situational awareness
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
on the rest of the finance movements
 
01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.310 align:start position:0%
on the rest of the finance movements
tomorrow

01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
there's no other finance
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
meetings scheduled until the three
 
01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.709 align:start position:0%
meetings scheduled until the three
o'clock

01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
but if you did a recess and announce it
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
now to a time certain that would be
 
01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.669 align:start position:0%
now to a time certain that would be
legal

01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
legal
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
to continue this the people that are
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
interested are here now as are the
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
people that might want to testify
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
and uh i'll ask
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
janet to put a note outside the door
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
and we could probably meet here at 11 or
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
something like that so so let's discuss
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
this uh it it it
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
we have to come in tomorrow anyways
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative long are you are you
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
gonna be there for the finance meeting
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow anyway so
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
i don't believe
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
for three o'clock i was i'd yeah i
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
didn't know about that but yeah i guess
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
at three i believe i am
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
we might
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
how long is it going to take you might
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
want to meet at 2 30 here so so this
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
this is what i'm thinking
 
01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:03.910 align:start position:0%
this is what i'm thinking
um

01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of words i think
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
in 259 that we the amen or the amendment
 
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
to 459 has a lot of words in it it's got
 
01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.350 align:start position:0%
to 459 has a lot of words in it it's got
probably

01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
five or six different concepts in it uh
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
to me that is not a 30-minute
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
conversation that feels to me to be
 
01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.950 align:start position:0%
conversation that feels to me to be
longer

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
longer
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
what do you think miss ripple
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
it could be longer for sure um i think
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
everything that's in the amendment was
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
talked about yesterday however seeing it
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
with fresh eyes might uh encourage more
 
01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.310 align:start position:0%
with fresh eyes might uh encourage more
conversation

01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay so we we could get through it in 30
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
minutes it could take 90 minutes
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
so so so what i'm thinking go ahead
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
represent i just we um we had scheduled
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
a caucus
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
for all the finance democrats at two
 
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.430 align:start position:0%
for all the finance democrats at two
o'clock

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
before the three o'clock meeting so if
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
we could just avoid that because then
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
i've got to change everybody yes ma'am
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
so so here's my proposal
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
i propose
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
we start at 11
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
and then if we finish early then we can
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
have a nice relaxing lunch and you can
 
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
you can saunter into the
 
01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:11.830 align:start position:0%
you can saunter into the
caucus

01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
um and and if it happens to go long
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
we have some time to handle it and have
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
a complete conversation and we'd still
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
be done by two with probably time to
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
