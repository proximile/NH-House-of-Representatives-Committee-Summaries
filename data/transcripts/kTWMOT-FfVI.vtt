see her because she's been waiting for
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
so long for somebody because she
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
she needed him
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%

now

00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.309 align:start position:0%
we have 10 bills on the agenda this
morning

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%

the last bill is house bill 10
 
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.350 align:start position:0%
the last bill is house bill 10
0

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
0
 
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.150 align:start position:0%
0
1063

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
1063
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
had to do with
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
technical corrections for the
 
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.909 align:start position:0%
technical corrections for the
dra

00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
dra
 
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
we passed that out of this committee and
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
i held it
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
because the senate had senate bill 435
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
which is all there's a lot of similarity
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
with that bill
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
and waiting to see
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
what the senate did on that
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
they passed it out a committee
 
00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.230 align:start position:0%
they passed it out a committee
amended

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
and it was supposed to have been heard
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
it's going to be held
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
in session on the 16th of this month
 
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.230 align:start position:0%
in session on the 16th of this month
so

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to do with 1063
 
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have jennifer do a
 
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
between senate bill 435
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
and house bill 1063
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
so we can see what the differences are
 
00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:15.350 align:start position:0%
so we can see what the differences are
because

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
i looked at my folder and i'm starting
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
to get confused on the thing
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
the next time we meet
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
we'll have that side by side and i'll
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
have the dra to come in
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
so answer any questions and and uh
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
full committee understands what's going
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
on both with the senate bill and our
 
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.910 align:start position:0%
on both with the senate bill and our
bill

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
and then we can decide what action we
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
want to take on that so we're going to
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
so we'll go to
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
1097

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
1097
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
is relative to taxation of income
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
we're going to hold this bill
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
because there's more work that needs to
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
be done on it
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
they haven't been able to come up with
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
an amendment that
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
is clear
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.550 align:start position:0%
between dra and the ag's office about
our

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
tax law and to what extent we would be
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
violating our own tax law in this bill
 
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
if it wouldn't be better to have a
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
lawyer on our side
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
looking at it
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
instead of justifying definitely yes
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury you're an
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
attorney right
 
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.389 align:start position:0%
attorney right
and

00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:05.269 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
i am not a lawyer
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
so they
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
we have somebody from the attorney
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
that that's here now yes and hi sam and
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming he's going to be working
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
and he doesn't have a solution at this
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
but he's going to
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
work to come up with a solution if it
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
can be
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
if it can happen
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's not an easy
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
i have a great deal of respect for
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
attorney garland but
 
00:13:47.199 --> 00:13:48.389 align:start position:0%
attorney garland but

on
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
it would be comforting to make sure that
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
there's someone from dra that's on top
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
all right any other
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
relative to the rates of the business
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
profits tax in the business enterprise
 
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:40.230 align:start position:0%
profits tax in the business enterprise
tax

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.509 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's on
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
which is amendment
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
which representative genevieve you want
 
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.030 align:start position:0%
which representative genevieve you want
to

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
talk about your
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
amendment yes thank you mr chairman yes
 
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
0471h to
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
hb1221 and very simply what
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
i've done here is pretty much cut out
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
there were two taxes being cut here the
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
bpt business profits tax and the
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax the bet
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
i've removed
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
the bet
 
00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
tax portion of this so there would be no
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
reduction to the bet tax only the
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
reduction to the b peep t
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
business profits tax from 7.6 to 7.5
 
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.310 align:start position:0%
business profits tax from 7.6 to 7.5
percent

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
yields about an 8 million dollar
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
reduction in revenues over the year
 
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.870 align:start position:0%
reduction in revenues over the year
however

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
not lowering the bet tax
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
which was estimated as about i don't
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
have it right in front of you about a 27
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
or 28 million reduction
 
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.030 align:start position:0%
or 28 million reduction
um

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
could mean that the bpt doesn't
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
drop as much the revenue loss so
 
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.150 align:start position:0%
drop as much the revenue loss so
um

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
i guess it'd be nice if we could have um
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
dra maybe give us a new fiscal note
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
um on that piece
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
but um but i would argue that um if
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to lower any tax this is the
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
tax to focus on it's the most visible
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
tax to
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
businesses and and outside
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
people who are looking potentially to
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
come to new hampshire
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
i think it's 7.5 percent business
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
profits tax looks favorable
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
it looks favorable as compared to
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
surrounding states uh vermont i believe
 
00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:53.749 align:start position:0%
surrounding states uh vermont i believe
was

00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
i may have this backwards vermont is i
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
believe 8.3 and mass is 8.0 or i've got
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
the two mix but in any case the 7.5 is
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
enough of a difference that it
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
highlights new hampshire's business
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
friendly state
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
but we also are looking at a fairly
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
small drop in revenue going to 0.1
 
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.909 align:start position:0%
small drop in revenue going to 0.1
percent

00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
i'll ask the dra if they would come up
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
with a new fiscal note based on on this
 
00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:22.949 align:start position:0%
with a new fiscal note based on on this
amendment

00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
that they would only be doing the
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
reduction in the bpt and not the
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
reduction in the bet
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
how would that affect the fiscal note
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
and then we can handle this the next at
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i've been having some
 
00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:47.350 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i've been having some
conversation

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
with chris shea from lbao
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
about trying to figure out
 
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.470 align:start position:0%
about trying to figure out
what

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
the total effect of tax cuts is
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
during that he he mentioned that
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
these constant
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
recalibrations of our tax rates
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
is making it
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
just about impossible to do any kind of
 
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.310 align:start position:0%
just about impossible to do any kind of
longitudinal

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
longitudinal
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh study of that because every single
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
time they do one of these they do it
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
based on the most recent
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
kafir and the kafirs do not include a
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
of things that affect that year that
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
come later
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
they show up
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
a year or two later in the kafir
 
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.870 align:start position:0%
a year or two later in the kafir
and

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
seem to me
 
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.669 align:start position:0%
seem to me
that

00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to get much out of a fiscal
 
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.350 align:start position:0%
we're going to get much out of a fiscal
note

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
note
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
but it also seems to me like
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
this is not going to
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
send much of a signal to
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
the uh people
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
in other states that might be thinking
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
of coming to us but it is sending a
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
signal to all of the companies that pay
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
are going to
 
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.270 align:start position:0%
are going to
continue

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
to confront more of the load
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the business
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
while the companies that make big
 
00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:28.230 align:start position:0%
while the companies that make big
profits

thank you

thank you for your comments

representative
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to put this in context
 
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.470 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to put this in context
uh

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
and by this i mean uh
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
revenues even though it's relatively
 
00:19:51.679 --> 00:19:53.350 align:start position:0%
revenues even though it's relatively
small

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
i just spent yesterday evening
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
at the jaffrey rindge cooperative school
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
which was in many ways a very heartening
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
session for me a strong support for the
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
school district
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
jeffrey is one of the property poor
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
towns in the state
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
30th from the bottom
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
along with uh you're probably about the
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
same place charles down a little bit
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
higher maybe
 
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.070 align:start position:0%
higher maybe
um

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
the effect of the budget
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
recommended by the school committee
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
will be about a four dollar increase in
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
the property tax rate
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
if you trace back to the
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
state aid to jeffrey it's been going
 
00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:41.669 align:start position:0%
state aid to jeffrey it's been going
down

00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
not just because of a
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
shrinkage of the population the school
 
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
shrinkage of the population the school
population

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
because there's less of it
 
00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:51.830 align:start position:0%
because there's less of it
and

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's a big problem so
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
property taxes down
 
00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:58.789 align:start position:0%
property taxes down
state

00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:01.510 align:start position:0%
state
bbt

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
down or
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
keep it at least at the same level
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
maybe we can do something about the
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
property tax i've been working hard as
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
some know
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
on uh reform of our school funding
 
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.470 align:start position:0%
on uh reform of our school funding
system

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
it depends on tax revenue from
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
all of our
 
00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:22.230 align:start position:0%
all of our
collective

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
collective
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
sources at the state level
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
we can't really do anything about that
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
property tax problem if we don't have
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
revenue um so we've got a bit maybe you
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
could call it a dilemma
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
we've got to figure this out
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
when i see cuts like this i think about
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
what's happening at the local level
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
in places like jaffrey
 
00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:44.630 align:start position:0%
in places like jaffrey
and

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
how it affects the school children
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the jeffrey greens uh cooperative
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
school district and as i say there was
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
strong support
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh hand-wringing and
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
unhappiness about the tax rate but
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
strong support for the school district
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
in that meeting which was well attended
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
and had both
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
sides of the argument well presented
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to put that in context
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%

representing

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
representing
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to add on to that last
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
fall there was
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
a virtual meeting of the bia
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
the annual legislative
 
00:22:36.159 --> 00:22:38.230 align:start position:0%
the annual legislative
conference

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
conference
 
00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.350 align:start position:0%
conference
and

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
i listened into the part about
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
business taxes with businessmen
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
and they were
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
they were taught what what the
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
businessmen there were saying
 
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
once somebody from the audience asked a
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
question that was relayed to them
 
00:22:58.159 --> 00:22:59.270 align:start position:0%
question that was relayed to them
was

00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
that they either didn't know
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
what part of what taxes they were paying
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
they just got given the full amount that
 
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
they were paying
 
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.110 align:start position:0%
they were paying
or

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
they did know and they knew that the
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
property tax was the biggest part of
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
their tax bill
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
now when we're trying to help businesses
 
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
the question is are we trying to help
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
all businesses that are in this state
 
00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:29.110 align:start position:0%
all businesses that are in this state
that

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
come from this state and are staying in
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
this state
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
or are we only trying to help the ones
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
that are flooding around the country
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
developing huge profit margins and
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
moving when
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
it seems likely that one or the other
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
state is offering them more
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
i i very much appreciate the comments of
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative ames i share the concern
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
that if
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
taxes at the state level are cut too
 
00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:09.190 align:start position:0%
taxes at the state level are cut too
substantially

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
substantially
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
it just
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
drives the need on the local level
 
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.990 align:start position:0%
drives the need on the local level
further

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
and i will be looking
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
forward for ways to enhance the state's
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
participation in education costs so
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
taking in balance
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
for tax cut proposals that are before us
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
if i was to choose one that i would
 
00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:34.470 align:start position:0%
if i was to choose one that i would
support

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
it would be this cut of
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
a tenth of a percent to follow through
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
on a prior
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
series of cuts and a commitment
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh and get to a number that i think
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
people would
 
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.549 align:start position:0%
people would
remember

00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
and view positively so
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the proposals to cut
 
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:54.950 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the proposals to cut
the

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
communications tax
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
or the bet
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
i i will look less favorably on those
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
but i'm open-minded to this one and so
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
if we can think of it selectively
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
and come to a consensus that there's one
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
small incremental cut
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
i would suggest this would be it
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comment
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
all right then
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
we will deal with this at our next work
 
00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:43.269 align:start position:0%
we will deal with this at our next work
session

00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make the motion actually if
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
we go to the executive station
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
then we will go into executive session
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1430
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative brown thank you why i
 
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.789 align:start position:0%
representative brown thank you why i
move

00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
itl on house spell 1430.
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative romney you can speak to
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
your motion yes thank you
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
this call this bill calls for the
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
phasing out of the uh
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle rental tax
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
going down some of you on this committee
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
i think i'm looking to my right and to
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
my left here
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
were around when this tax was put into
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
place uh post claremont decision and
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
when they were looking for funding for
 
00:26:56.159 --> 00:26:58.070 align:start position:0%
when they were looking for funding for
education

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
it's not a big dollar amount it's only
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
about eight million dollars what we're
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
but believe it or not
 
00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:07.110 align:start position:0%
but believe it or not
uh

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
the majority here in this committee uh
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
agrees with what's a lot of what
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative ames was saying
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh and that we we want to tread lightly
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
on on the cuts that we do
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
and this is one that we don't
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
don't think it's it's worth cutting
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
there's various reasons for that first
 
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.669 align:start position:0%
there's various reasons for that first
off

00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
every other state has this car rental
 
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.269 align:start position:0%
every other state has this car rental
tax

00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
and our 8.5
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
car rental tax is
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
quite modest compared to other states i
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
mean really modest
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i you heard me speak about this in
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
one of our other uh meetings about about
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
how other states tack on all sorts of
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
other fees on top of their tax and we we
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
just we just haven't pure eight point it
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
was nine it's going to be 8.5 percent
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
so quite modest
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
now enterprise who testified
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
claimed that more locales rent than out
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
of staters uh my locals i say rent than
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
out of staters
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
and that may be true but when we probed
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
it turns out that a lot of those
 
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.110 align:start position:0%
it turns out that a lot of those
in-state

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
in-state
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
renters are renting cars for
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
uh if their car is wrecked or if it's in
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
for maintenance
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh and guess what and many of those
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
especially the car
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
the insurance is paying for it not the
 
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.750 align:start position:0%
the insurance is paying for it not the
individual

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.190 align:start position:0%
individual
so

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
so i have no problem continuing the tax
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
for taurus and and out of state business
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's just returning the same
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
favor that the other states do to us um
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
i mean it's
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
and they and they
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
they treat us
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
wow and i again like i said i used to
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
travel just about every week so i i know
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
i pretty much know all the rates in all
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
these other states
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
then we also heard from our state
 
00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:02.549 align:start position:0%
then we also heard from our state
treasurer

00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
at the economic briefing
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
and one of the one of the key things we
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
have to worry about our bond rating
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
and one of the one of the things that
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
that the bond rating agencies like to
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
see is the diversity of taxes
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
that we have to buffer against ups and
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
downs and certain segments of the
 
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.470 align:start position:0%
downs and certain segments of the
economy

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
economy
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
so this is just one small piece of that
 
00:29:24.159 --> 00:29:25.269 align:start position:0%
so this is just one small piece of that
diversity

00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
diversity
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
again six to seven i said eight million
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
before it's really six to seven million
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh that we're talking about with this
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
so if one if if business taxes are going
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason certain segments of
 
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
our economy drop at least we have some
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
other sources of revenue that's why we
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
like to have
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
different sources of revenue and that's
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
the same logic
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
that we i think we had with the uh
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
telecommunication tax again that wasn't
 
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
a big tax
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
but it was it's something that
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
we we used to balance our portfolio of
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
taxes if you will
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
and and given all of what we have been
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
talking about in this committee for the
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
last couple of months
 
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
do we still have all these unknowns
 
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.630 align:start position:0%
do we still have all these unknowns
about

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
about where the ppp refunds are going to
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh where the new provisions for the
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
credit carry forwards are going to come
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
in in terms of dollars that uh we're
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
gonna have to give back to
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
to the various businesses that are uh
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
now we put a limit on how much could be
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
carried forward
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh now that was just the first step
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
that's gonna continue we're gonna
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
continue cranking that down over time
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
and then of course the the phasing out
 
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
of the stimulus money
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
we have to really see what what that's
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
done to propping up our economy and it
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
could be uh
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know the revenues may not be flowing
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
as as fast as before so
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
with that i i would suggest that we all
 
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
vote itl on this and i think it's the
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
prudent thing to do thank you
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative romney
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments on the
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
motion of itl
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
represent ames
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
just to say that i i support the motion
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
i would also add that um
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
i think it was a year ago or so that we
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
worked on this uh
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
this tax and uh made sure it was
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
broadly applicable to comparable
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
transactions and um throughout that
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
discussion i don't remember any effort
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
to uh bring to our attention the need to
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh repeal the tax
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh i have not heard that
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
said to me you know that hasn't been
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
said to me
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh during all my time here it seems to
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
be a tax that uh
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
that exists and most people accept it as
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
the reality of life no matter where you
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
go you pay a tax when you rent a car and
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
this is the new hampshire's version
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
so i would leave it the way it is
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
first i i commend uh
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
the um proponent of this bill the prime
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor and bringing it forward for
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
discussion and examination
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
we also
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
had the benefit of
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
an impressive and serious
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
set of presentations by people who know
 
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.589 align:start position:0%
set of presentations by people who know
this

00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
subject and particularly the
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
agricultural side of uh
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
of this subject
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
far better than we do and that was
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
helpful and thoughtful
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
and productive
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
i think uh the the the reason that i
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
is twofold i think
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
first the elkship program
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
writ large it has wide support
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's achieved somehow an appropriate
 
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.790 align:start position:0%
it's achieved somehow an appropriate
balance

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
in its funding mechanism and in what it
 
00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.630 align:start position:0%
in its funding mechanism and in what it
does

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
and it does good work i mean you really
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
don't hear any
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
any criticism of what it's doing
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
it does good work
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned that we may
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
upset that balance
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
achievement of
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
a level of excellence that we can all
 
00:36:52.079 --> 00:36:53.030 align:start position:0%
a level of excellence that we can all
support

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
by going forward with this bill at this
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
time testimony from commissioner jasper
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh indicated that the agricultural
 
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.109 align:start position:0%
uh indicated that the agricultural
interests

00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
interests
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
that this bill seeks to
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
bring forward are definitely considered
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
within the frame of the current
 
00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.069 align:start position:0%
within the frame of the current
legislation

00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
so i just assume leave it leave it at
 
00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.589 align:start position:0%
so i just assume leave it leave it at
that

00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:16.630 align:start position:0%
that
and

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
leave the program to march along and
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
maybe at another time it will be
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate to
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
both uh
 
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.630 align:start position:0%

an emphasis on agriculture
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
and provide additional funding but i
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
this bill made me recall
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
it evoked memories of my grandmother and
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
i'd like to share a short story with you
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
in the mid 60s maybe 1966 or so my
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
grandmother took my brother sister and i
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
to a nursing home where my
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
great-grandmother was
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they only allowed two kids
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
in there once so my brother and sister
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
being older than me got to go into the
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
nursing home to visit my great
 
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.510 align:start position:0%
nursing home to visit my great
grandmother

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
grandmother
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
they left me in the car with the back
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
window rolled down a little bit so i
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
could get some air
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
when they came out after visiting my
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
great-grandmother they each had
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
a full hershey bar
 
00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
these aren't the little hershey bars the
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
what they call fun size which i don't
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
know why they call the little ones the
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
fun size
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
but uh i guess my grandmother saw the
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
look in my eyes and she insisted that my
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
brother and sister each give me half of
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
the hershey bar
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
my brother objected saying but that'll
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
mean alan gets a full hersh my
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
grandmother interrupted and said don't
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
you be selfish or slap you down so they
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
each had to give me half of their
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
hershey bar
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
well this bill house bill 1478
 
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.349 align:start position:0%
well this bill house bill 1478
is

00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
where it's coming from it's compassion
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
and the intent is good
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
but it it's
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
the bill is sort of it's so flawed it's
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's nonsensical and it negates the
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
um what this bill does is
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
for any employer with more than 100
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
employees if any one employee
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
makes 15 or less
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
it subjects that
 
00:41:59.839 --> 00:42:00.950 align:start position:0%
it subjects that
business

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
to a surtax
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
raising the business
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
profits tax from seven point six percent
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
to eight percent
 
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.670 align:start position:0%
to eight percent
um

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
many deficiencies with the bill and i'll
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
highlight the main one and that is this
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
is clearly unconstitutional
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh specifically when considering the
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
clause included in part two article five
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire constitution
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
regarding equal and proportional tax
 
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.589 align:start position:0%
regarding equal and proportional tax
rates

00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
for that's the primary reason i'll spare
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
all the other reasons because i just
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
can't get by the constitutionality of
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
this for that reason i suggest that this
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
bill be ito'd
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%

you can expect your motion thank you mr
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
um while well-meaning and i think we had
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
some testimony that suggested that
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
if the communications tax was cut
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
for uh telecom and cable companies
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
it would help result in
 
00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.069 align:start position:0%
it would help result in
bringing

00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
bringing
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
high-speed services to more households
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
however there's nothing in the bill that
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
requires that and there's nothing that
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
suggests that that would have to happen
 
00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.990 align:start position:0%
suggests that that would have to happen
so

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
the the other side of this is that
 
00:45:50.319 --> 00:45:51.270 align:start position:0%
the the other side of this is that
cutting

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
cutting
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
taxes on those companies
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
will result in
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
in potentially
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
towns and cities having to raise taxes
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
on other
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
entities and taxpayers
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to that there's a question
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
of constitutionality with this bill
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
you know it seems it looks like it would
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
not pass constitutional muster given
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
that you are
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
selecting certain companies not to have
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
property taxes so for these reasons
 
00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.470 align:start position:0%
property taxes so for these reasons

waiting probably to testify on
 
00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.750 align:start position:0%
waiting probably to testify on
whether

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
but i think we could go forward
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
since we have an understanding about her
 
00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.270 align:start position:0%

chair

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
this bill terminates the uh fm frm
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
victims contribution recovery fund
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
and i guess it would cancel out all of
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
funding that's
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
already been passed in
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:35.910 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
this is the financial resources mortgage
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
frm victims contribution fund that was
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
established a couple of years ago
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
but just funded uh this past budget with
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
5 million fiscal year ending june 30th
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
of 22 and another 5 million
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
ending june 30th 2023.
 
00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
from the testimony there is no question
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
that the state failed at its oversight
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility thus leading to the
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
failure of frm and harm to its investors
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
this 10 million dollar combination uh
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
the two five millions
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
in no way covers for all the losses
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
incurred by the investors in this fund
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill to repeal this fund
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
and the money already appropriated it
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
would be a classic bait and switch
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
by the state of new hampshire
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
which in my opinion would be an
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
embarrassment to the state if we did
 
00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.790 align:start position:0%
embarrassment to the state if we did
this

00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
please vote itl and i would appreciate
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%

on
 
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
the lawyers in our group cannot remember
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
that any state has ever
 
00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.870 align:start position:0%
that any state has ever
compensated

00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
investors
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
that lost their shirts
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
without being forced to buy a lawsuit
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
but on
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
those of us in
 
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.309 align:start position:0%
those of us in
in

00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
on the democratic side of the aisle
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
believe that it is too late at this
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
point to stop the process of
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
distribution that would be
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
an even worse precedent
 
00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:31.750 align:start position:0%
an even worse precedent
to

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
stop distributing once we have sent out
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
information to investors that this
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
exists and that they should apply
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
so we are voting itl
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
with the majority
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
and uh there will be a
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
short statement about some members
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
feeling that we should not stop the
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
process at this point
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
added to the blurb thank you
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
and that will happen
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
represent ames
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to add that this i
 
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
see this as a unique situation
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
that uh grew out of uh
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
a bad behavior by
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
certain people in the private sector
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
and then a uh
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
confused and discombobulated and uh
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
and harmful response from the state side
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
and that led to years of uh
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
effort by investors
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
who had been scammed to
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
somehow recover some funds and ended
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
i think too late effort to try to repeal
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
what was decided
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
last year so i stand with that
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh repeal
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
but i also want to note that the state
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
has taken significant action
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
since um
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
since this came to light in the early
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
part of the 2000s
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
and we heard about that we had testimony
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
and that was good
 
00:53:14.319 --> 00:53:16.870 align:start position:0%
and that was good
the

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
looking forward we can be hopeful that
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
this won't happen again but i would
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
reiterate that this is a unique
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
situation and i would expect that
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
investors need to keep their eyes open
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
state guidance to bail them out if their
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ames
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman notwithstanding
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
what the ranking member
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
and the vice ranking member have said
 
00:53:52.559 --> 00:53:53.349 align:start position:0%
and the vice ranking member have said
uh

00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
one point
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
i did ask the ag
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
has this ever gone to a court of record
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh if the state was liable
 
00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.069 align:start position:0%
uh if the state was liable
and

00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
were they responsible and both times
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
not to his knowledge
 
00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.069 align:start position:0%
not to his knowledge
and

00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
i sort of get an answer to that one
 
00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
to my question the second part is
 
00:54:14.319 --> 00:54:15.349 align:start position:0%
to my question the second part is
uh

00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
ronald reagan
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
president reagan said
 
00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.470 align:start position:0%
president reagan said
uh

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:21.670 align:start position:0%
uh
party

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
his party does not believe in bailouts
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
he believes in personal responsibility
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
and he said that the approach
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
that they were dealing with
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
back then
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
on a particular item
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
even though i'm going to vote with our
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
the state is providing charity to these
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
individuals that should have
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
taken more personal responsibility
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
further class representing yearly
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
i've had some experience taking cases to
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
court uh not as a
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer but as supporting
 
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.030 align:start position:0%
lawyer but as supporting
lawyers

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
lawyers
 
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.150 align:start position:0%
lawyers
and

00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.549 align:start position:0%
and
my

00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
observation has been
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
that when somebody loses in court they
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
lose more
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
than if a settlement out of court had
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
been made
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i look at this uh
 
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
arrangement that the state has made
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
under frm as the settlement out of court
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
saving the state
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of money
 
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.150 align:start position:0%
a lot of money
as

00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
we heard in testimony and testimony and
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
testimony because of some malfeasance on
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
the part of
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
various state operators which would have
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
most likely have
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
wound up with a
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh i'll use somebody else's language
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
from new york huge
 
00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:54.870 align:start position:0%
from new york huge
settlement

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:57.829 align:start position:0%
but uh
so

00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of the itl motion thank you
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any further
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
comments representative murphy thank you
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
of all the bills this session this is
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
the one that's probably given me the
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
most angst personally
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
for two reasons one is that
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
i was
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
to be consistent i voted last summer
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
to support the amendment to eliminate
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
the 10 million dollars
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
for support of this fund
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
in the amendment uh 1064-h
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
i'm also
 
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the same opinion as ronald reagan and
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg that personal
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility and
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
the accountability of
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
of the state needs to be considered if
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
there is any malfeasance on their part
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
but the state as a bailout you know
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
mechanism for
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
investors that
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
lost money to me is a horrible
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
precedent so
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
in in large part i am
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
concerned by myself being inconsistent
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
because i will probably vote with the
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
majority in our our caucus
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
but it does give me angst to
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
vote in a sense for bailout of investors
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
and also to be inconsistent with my
 
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
previous vote of last summer thank you
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%

thank you this one is
 
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
more personal but it's an example of the
 
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.430 align:start position:0%
more personal but it's an example of the
problems

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
that our attorney general's office has
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
had when i arrived and still has
 
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.230 align:start position:0%
had when i arrived and still has
it's

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.470 align:start position:0%
it's
understaffed

00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
understaffed
 
00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.910 align:start position:0%
understaffed
and

00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
purposefully i think and it
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
does not provide consumer protection
 
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
support to the ordinary citizen of new
 
00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:57.349 align:start position:0%
support to the ordinary citizen of new
hampshire

00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
as an example there was a
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
fraudulent roofer
 
00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:03.829 align:start position:0%
fraudulent roofer
that

00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
took in
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think it was eight people on our side
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the connecticut river
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
three of them in my complex
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
two of them it took the roof off
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
and then didn't come back and the others
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
it had taken that he'd taken the deposit
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
and he didn't come back
 
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
there were i think 28
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
victims on the other side of the
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
connecticut river
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
the attorney general of vermont went
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
after the guy
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
got him locked up got him condemned to
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
restitution for the vermonters
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
nothing was done on our side
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
of the river
 
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:46.950 align:start position:0%
of the river
and

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
it was a significant loss for some of my
 
00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:50.549 align:start position:0%
it was a significant loss for some of my
neighbors

00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
00:58:50.559 --> 00:58:52.789 align:start position:0%

00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
and not to mention that they had to live
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
through the winter with a plastic
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.119 --> 00:59:04.390 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
i do not think that any other state
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
probably does as bad a job of consumer
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
protection for
 
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
multiple cases like that
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
as we do
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
and it's because
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough people to work it
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
they also don't have enough people to
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
help with the condominium problems
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
which is one of my pet peeves
 
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.589 align:start position:0%
which is one of my pet peeves
so

00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
just getting it off my chest
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
almi represented ames
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
yeah just a note uh
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
on this question of inconsistency i too
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh suffer the
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
uh inconsistency angst but uh
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
not so much because i think uh once
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
she's it's sort of the bait and switch
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
metaphor that uh representative ramy
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
used uh
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
i think that's the metaphor he used
 
00:59:57.359 --> 00:59:58.549 align:start position:0%
i think that's the metaphor he used
um

00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
we've started down a road
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
we've uh
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
gone past that vote and started up a
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
program it's in place
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
they're uh so they've solicited
 
01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.710 align:start position:0%
they're uh so they've solicited
applications

01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
applications
 
01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.510 align:start position:0%
applications
they're

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
processing applications if they've come
 
01:00:13.839 --> 01:00:14.789 align:start position:0%
processing applications if they've come
in

01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
we've started down a road and it's it's
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
just too late to close that barn door to
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
use another metaphor
 
01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:23.750 align:start position:0%
use another metaphor
and

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
then so off we go and i think we go with
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of concerns but that's where we
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
i figured this off
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
i couldn't hear you he said that
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
no objection
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
but i was cautioning the emotion maker
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
and the seconder that this will likely
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
i'm going to put this on the regular
 
01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:46.150 align:start position:0%
i'm going to put this on the regular
calendar

01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.349 align:start position:0%
 
mr

mr
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
chairman if you're going to do that we
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
might have a lengthy discussion
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
because we we might have to talk on our
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
side of it as well and then there would
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
be the side of the people that did the
 
01:03:02.559 --> 01:03:04.549 align:start position:0%
be the side of the people that did the
motion

01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay then i'll reverse my decision on
 
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.309 align:start position:0%
okay then i'll reverse my decision on
that

01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:08.319 --> 01:03:09.430 align:start position:0%
that
and

01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
put it on the consent calendar and if it
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
gets pulled off then we will have the
 
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.349 align:start position:0%
gets pulled off then we will have the
discussion

01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:18.789 align:start position:0%

01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
that is going to be we're going to
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury um
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%

01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
establish a national service alumni
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
attraction and retention discussion now
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
by representative schamberg
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg you want to
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
speak to your amendment i will defer to
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
representative pillsbury
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
we're in work session now right
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm not prepared to make a motion at
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
this time
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to hear
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg explain his
 
01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.750 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg explain his
amendment

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
suggest that
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
we have serious reservations about this
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
and i think those reservations
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
will carry to the amendment as well but
 
01:04:42.319 --> 01:04:43.910 align:start position:0%
will carry to the amendment as well but
uh

01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
i think we need to hear
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
what you've done and how you believe it
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%

what initially was a
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
i thought an easy bill
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
i should never think that
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative ames pointed out some
 
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:11.920 align:start position:0%

amendment

01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%

01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
the majority ranking member did point
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
out some things to us because of her
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
that maybe we should look at this
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
redrafting again
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
and we did that we came up with a second
 
01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.109 align:start position:0%
and we did that we came up with a second
one

01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
there were some more questions
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
just about word placement
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh who had responsibility who has
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
controlled the money
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
and what we took out was the arp of
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
funds the actual wording of the arpa
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
funds out of a
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
roman numeral ii
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
thought we had it done when we came up
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
with this amendment but there's been
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
some question about
 
01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.870 align:start position:0%
some question about
uh

01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of money to be hereby
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
appropriated and i would like the
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go back to the ols
 
01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:19.510 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go back to the ols
and

01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
ask them to look at how the money will
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
be appropriated
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
it looks as it's a demand
 
01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.789 align:start position:0%
it looks as it's a demand
versus

01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
an approach of
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
a decision by
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
the governor and the executive council
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
and that's where
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and i believe it should be
 
01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.750 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and i believe it should be
um

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
there were two words that had to be
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
added in
 
01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.069 align:start position:0%
added in
the

01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:46.079 --> 01:06:47.190 align:start position:0%
the
original

01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
section four roman numeral one
 
01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
permissible use had to be established so
 
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
the workforce development word on line
 
01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.630 align:start position:0%
the workforce development word on line
nine

01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
nine
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
and the word education had to be added
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
this is where the arpa money was stated
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the beginning when representative
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
ames talked about the drafting
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
it is now a generic
 
01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:21.109 align:start position:0%
it is now a generic
approach

01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:07:21.119 --> 01:07:22.870 align:start position:0%
approach
of

01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
additional gifts grants donations or
 
01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.470 align:start position:0%
additional gifts grants donations or
bequeaths

01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
bequeaths
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
or any federal state or local funds
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
that made it more than what was said
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
before it just said it shall come from
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
arpa which we did not the sponsor did
 
01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:40.870 align:start position:0%
arpa which we did not the sponsor did
not

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
wish that and does not wish it to come
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
out of the general fund also
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
put an amount in
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
but is it but put a statement is hereby
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
with certain federal funds you can't say
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
you must
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
and so we'd like to take it back mr
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury for
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
maybe a fourth redrafting which may
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
clear up some of the issues that you had
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to hold this for further for
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
a further work session and you'll get an
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that representative
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
romney representative
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
almi followed by representative romney
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:30.799 --> 01:08:31.669 align:start position:0%
thank you
i'm

01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
a little confused
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
by this on the process that is
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
set up is that
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
the money is appropriated
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
on and then the governor shall determine
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
if there are discretionary funds
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
appropriated in arba
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
this was cleared with the sponsor
 
01:08:54.319 --> 01:08:56.709 align:start position:0%
this was cleared with the sponsor
and

01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
it also um
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
what it means
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
and what has happened in the past is
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
that the governor
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
if he decides that there isn't any money
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
in there because he wanted to use it for
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
something else
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
can just not do it
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
and that can be a problem but the
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
and it's not such a problem for them
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
because the governor
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
has a
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
member as a person on their uh
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
their board
 
01:09:30.159 --> 01:09:31.590 align:start position:0%
their board
who

01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
is constantly involved with what they're
 
01:09:33.839 --> 01:09:34.950 align:start position:0%
is constantly involved with what they're
doing

01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.189 align:start position:0%
doing
and

01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
and the governor seems to approve of
 
01:09:39.839 --> 01:09:41.110 align:start position:0%
and the governor seems to approve of
this

01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.910 align:start position:0%
this
so

01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is taking money
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
from arpa that will disappear if it's
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
not used
 
01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.070 align:start position:0%
not used
on

01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.430 align:start position:0%
on
and

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
on putting
 
01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.310 align:start position:0%
on putting
this

01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
not very big amount
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
three-quarters of a million dollars for
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
over three years
 
01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:05.189 align:start position:0%
over three years
into

01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
a board that
 
01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.189 align:start position:0%
a board that
is

01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
trying to increase its work with
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
employers around the state to keep
 
01:10:14.239 --> 01:10:15.350 align:start position:0%
employers around the state to keep
people

01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
that are valuable to the state of new
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire in new hampshire working
 
01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.669 align:start position:0%
hampshire in new hampshire working
and

01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
includes some help in
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
americorps and
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
return peace corps volunteers
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
getting the further education that will
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
make them more valuable
 
01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.870 align:start position:0%
make them more valuable
so

01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
it seemed like a very good bang for the
 
01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:37.990 align:start position:0%
it seemed like a very good bang for the
book

01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
book
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
and the buck isn't ours the buck is the
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
federal government's
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative romney
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
just the two comments on this
 
01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:48.390 align:start position:0%
just the two comments on this
uh

01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
i think somewhere in here you should say
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
that the the
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
state treasurer creates a fund
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
and it's administered by the
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner department of
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
administrative services but it's really
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
the fund is created and maintained by
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
the treasurer
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
i've had other bills where that language
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
so you may want to check with
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
ols on that
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and then that
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
unless it's in there i i just scanned it
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
here i didn't i didn't see it but
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing
 
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
when i read line 23
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
22 and 23

drafting okay if i could the drafter put
in

01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
on if there is not enough money in arpa
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to come out of the general
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
fund and we took it out
 
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.270 align:start position:0%
fund and we took it out
okay

01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
but i'm just saying i i don't know that
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
it just
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
casual reader here it just sounds like
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to be state money so i'd i'd
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
is there any other organization that is
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
you know similar to the peace corps or
 
01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.590 align:start position:0%
you know similar to the peace corps or
americorps

01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
americorps
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
there any other organizations that we
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
we would have to check that out and
 
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
represent elmi yeah
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
we have i don't i forget about 350
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds at this point
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
some of them are just
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
donations and most of those are dead
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
funds that we're weeding out as we go on
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
most of them are getting money either as
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
a percentage of
 
01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:12.630 align:start position:0%
a percentage of
some

01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
fee or some tax
 
01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.390 align:start position:0%
fee or some tax
and

01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
or they got an appropriation from the
 
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
state or a federal or other source
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
that frequently was one time and is
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
meant to be revolving or meant just to
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
finish after a while
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
and this one the the people who got
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
who are asking for the money the board
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
what do they call that board
 
01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:43.350 align:start position:0%
what do they call that board
the

01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.310 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
volunteer new hampshire board
 
01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:47.510 align:start position:0%
volunteer new hampshire board
on

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.470 align:start position:0%
on
they

01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
went into this
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
expecting that it was going to last them
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
three years
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
and that during that time they would
 
01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.669 align:start position:0%
and that during that time they would
develop

01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
develop
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
enough more contacts within the business
 
01:14:00.159 --> 01:14:01.430 align:start position:0%
enough more contacts within the business
community

01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to keep going on
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative bernstein followed by
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative murphy thank you mr chair
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
on february 2nd the the prime sponsor of
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
the bill made of reference to 750 000
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
over three years and representative
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
ahmed you just referenced that twice
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
where is that language in the bill or
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
actually the way that we did it they
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
were saying either 250 a year or 750
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
and we just decided okay
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
give them the 750
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to use it over three years
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
if there's still some left at the end
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
since it's a dedicated fund until we get
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
around to
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
to repealing it at some point and it
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
it would
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
probably be used in the fourth year
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
and if
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
they decided to go two years they could
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
but to be clear the appropriation is a
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
one-time appropriation of 750 000 and is
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
it possible for that
 
01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.270 align:start position:0%
it possible for that
money

01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
to be depleted
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
before three years or
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
two years or one year
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
i should think it could be
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
the governor's
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
person on the
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
council would probably have a problem
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
representative murphy thank you mr
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
in response to representative aaron's uh
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh question i i i don't think we are
 
01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.990 align:start position:0%
uh question i i i don't think we are
supporting

01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
the various organizations by the wording
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
here it says
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
americorps alumni
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
returned peace corps volunteers
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
people have completed one or more terms
 
01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
in the civil service so i think what
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
we're really trying to do is not support
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
those organizations but attract and
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
bring back those qualified and dedicated
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
individuals so that to me makes a
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
difference as in the sense that we're
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
not supporting an individual
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
organization but more an attraction of
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
trying to attract good qualified people
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
representative tucker yes i think
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative aaron you weren't here to
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
hear the testimony
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
that began the process
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't remember the name of the
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
report but there was a report on how do
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
we keep
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
good people here in new hampshire who
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
are leaving
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of effort to
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
understand why it is that we have
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
trouble attracting and keeping young
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
younger workers
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
and there was a report and it suggested
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
this kind of process
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
that would allow
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
small amounts of money to be matched
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
for educational grants that would keep
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
this very group of people
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
many of whom leave so it it wasn't so
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
much that it was started on the basis
 
01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
that there was a precedent already
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
for such a fund but that this was a way
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
to meet today's demands
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
of young people to make new hampshire
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
more attractive so it was a workforce
 
01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.350 align:start position:0%
more attractive so it was a workforce
development

01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.870 align:start position:0%
development
report

01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
and does anyone remember the name of the
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.669 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
i've got it in my hand it was passed out
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
to us i think in the white folder that
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
they sent us
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
represent aaron
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair thank you for
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
that representative tucker um
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
are we aware of any other states that um
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
do this sort of um
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know have this sort of uh
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
at the mr chair
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
at the present time know that new
 
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire would be the first in the
 
01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.390 align:start position:0%
hampshire would be the first in the
nation

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
nation
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
and approach it this way thank you
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative spillsberg
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
i i think there are a number of uh
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
questions and arguments that could be
 
01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:32.470 align:start position:0%
questions and arguments that could be
made

01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
whether this is a good idea in the first
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
place to be the first state to do this
 
01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.149 align:start position:0%
place to be the first state to do this
and

01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
what exactly motivates it um i i
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
understood from representative wilhelm's
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that this was driven largely
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
by workforce development objectives but
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
a careful read of the
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
commission's report which he authored
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
i think reaffirms my
 
01:18:56.719 --> 01:18:57.990 align:start position:0%
i think reaffirms my
impression

01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
impression
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
that in fact
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
the peace corps program itself and the
 
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
americorps program itself
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
are substantially driven by workforce
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
development objectives and it's the
 
01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.149 align:start position:0%
development objectives and it's the
experience

01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
of spending two years overseas in the
 
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
peace corps or a year or more in
 
01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.790 align:start position:0%
peace corps or a year or more in
americorps

01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
americorps
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
that in fact prepares
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
a young person to be
 
01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
a young person to be
attractive

01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
attractive
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
in the workforce or to be better
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
prepared to get the most out of further
 
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.229 align:start position:0%
prepared to get the most out of further
education

01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm's
 
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
report is really quite effective in that
 
01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.630 align:start position:0%
report is really quite effective in that
respect

01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
respect
 
01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:35.590 align:start position:0%
respect
and

01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
there's another
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
extensive piece that was also included
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
in that packet
 
01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.470 align:start position:0%
in that packet
that

01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
primarily dwells on how well prepared
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
those individuals are when they emerge
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
from the program
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm suspecting that
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
what really is the motive behind the
 
01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:55.830 align:start position:0%
what really is the motive behind the
bill

01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.270 align:start position:0%
bill
is

01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
the attraction and retention the
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
question of
 
01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:01.990 align:start position:0%
question of
um

01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
you know not even so much whether
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
they've enhanced
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
workflow but can we keep them in the
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
state well who are they and
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
you know one would hope that
 
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh youth who go through this program
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
would return to the state
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
one might hope that
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
people who come from other states and
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
spend a year here in americorps
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
choose to stay i think those are really
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
valid objectives
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
but i think that
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
it still raises the question whether
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
this is the right mechanism
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
and whether they should be truly singled
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
out so for example if we're going to
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
dedicate a certain amount of funds
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
what's the distinguishing
 
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.270 align:start position:0%
what's the distinguishing
feature

01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
feature
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
that allows us to target the money to
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
these individuals but exclude
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
a wide array
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
of young people whose prospects are
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
equally bright and whose
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
presence in the state would be equally
 
01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.830 align:start position:0%
presence in the state would be equally
valuable

01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
i don't see that distinguishing criteria
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
in the bill in effect i think the bill
 
01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.830 align:start position:0%
in the bill in effect i think the bill
suffers

01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
suffers
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
from a lack of
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
specific and useful parameters it really
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
how much
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
for how long
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
for what purpose
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
with what conditions
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
with what performance expectations or
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
requirements and what outcomes
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
if i as a benefactor chose to establish
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
a scholarship
 
01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:34.790 align:start position:0%
a scholarship
fund

01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
i would lay out those criteria and
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
they're completely absent in this bill
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
which leaves me to believe it's just
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
going to be a wide open rule-making
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
exercise so i think the bill has flaws
 
01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:46.870 align:start position:0%
exercise so i think the bill has flaws
and

01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
and i would just
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
go back to representative alame's point
 
01:21:52.239 --> 01:21:54.709 align:start position:0%
go back to representative alame's point
the

01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
the idea that the funds can be up to 250
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
per year for three years
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
and would come from arpa funds
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
is clear in your statement but it is not
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative spellsbury
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd like to point out we are
 
01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.750 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd like to point out we are
talking

01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
about a small organization which has
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
ties to the peace corps volunteers and
 
01:22:28.239 --> 01:22:29.990 align:start position:0%

on and that this committee after a huge
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
amount of work
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
on arguing
 
01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.629 align:start position:0%
on arguing
approved

01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
approved
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
an enormous amount of money
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
to go to
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
the army
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
program in manchester
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh for similar purposes
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
but specifically for
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
iowa uh
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh how do you call it bio biomechanical
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%

01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
and we still don't have a report on that
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
further comments
 
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.150 align:start position:0%
further comments
then

01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:32.310 align:start position:0%
then

01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
we have some work to do on this bill

01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
put it into the pile
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%

and uh
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%

about a report represent representative
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%

in our next meeting on the 25th of
 
01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.950 align:start position:0%

01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
down the right person
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
maureen tui
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh who
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%

deals who would know something about the
tax

01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:28.719 align:start position:0%
break part that we gave
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
and then we invited james
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh key
 
01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
james key
 
01:24:33.679 --> 01:24:35.270 align:start position:0%
james key
wallace

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
wallace
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
who knows something about the tuition
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
forgiveness part of this
 
01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:40.790 align:start position:0%
forgiveness part of this
so

01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh we hope to
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's amazing
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
i don't really know how many people have
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
how many small companies have taken
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of the program
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
kind of hints that
 
01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.470 align:start position:0%
kind of hints that
yes

01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
there's at least one because they won't
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
tell us but since they won't tell us
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
it's under 10.
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
now i called the commissioner the other
 
01:25:10.159 --> 01:25:12.229 align:start position:0%
now i called the commissioner the other
day

01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
in revenue on department review
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
and i said can you help us out a little
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
bit here i know i know we're not allowed
 
01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:19.430 align:start position:0%
bit here i know i know we're not allowed
to

01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
but it'd be helpful if we you're not to
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
give us names companies or anything like
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
that just to have a dollar amount
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
how many uh you know or uh how many
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
companies how much
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
how much of a tax break have we given to
 
01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:33.110 align:start position:0%
how much of a tax break have we given to
date

01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
date
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
from this program
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
and then when i talked to uh key wallace
 
01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
he said they just got the rules through
 
01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:41.990 align:start position:0%
he said they just got the rules through
yeah

01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
so he's right now zero of taking pace of
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
the trip so but if anybody's interested
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
and want to hear it because it's nine
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
o'clock on the on the uh 25th
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh we're we're bringing the right people
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
in the room to give us an update
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
i think it will be like i think all
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
these things are live streamed yes
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
and interestingly enough i was i managed
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
to because
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative and i
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
and uh senator geider are also on the uh
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming committee
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
i i managed to get us in the same room
 
01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:16.870 align:start position:0%
i i managed to get us in the same room
and

01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know this is a house committee
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
so we're not allowed to use the senate
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
room but we're going to use the center
 
01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:23.669 align:start position:0%
room but we're going to use the center
room

01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
for an hour and a half before the
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
they were so gracious enough to allow us
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
to use the senate room that we're going
 
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
to be in for the other
 
01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.430 align:start position:0%
to be in for the other
so

01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
um anyway if you're interested in it
 
01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's on the 25th i'll make another
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
announcement before we get there thank
 
01:26:37.199 --> 01:26:38.070 align:start position:0%
announcement before we get there thank
you

01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
i would recommend that you either
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
do it virtually
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
or go to it because it's something that
 
01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
we ought to be aware
 
01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:48.639 align:start position:0%
of what the results
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill that we passed i think
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
four years ago
 
01:26:53.679 --> 01:27:00.629 align:start position:0%
four years ago
and

01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
right and so
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
we need to get what's the feedback has
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
it worked
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
and that okay
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh any further discussion on
 
01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.669 align:start position:0%
uh any further discussion on
1524

01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
1524
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
saying none that's
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to discuss it at the future
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
work session which hasn't been set yet
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
and the last bill
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
relative to the old
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
that has
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue working on that
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of issues that are open
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh we're not ready
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
not unless you want to either kill it or
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
go to interim study
 
01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
but we have
 
01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.470 align:start position:0%
but we have
four

01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:02.149 align:start position:0%
four
weeks

01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:28:02.159 --> 01:28:03.110 align:start position:0%
weeks
left

01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
left
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to spend some time
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
understanding this better
 
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
and what i want to do when we do meet
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
next time review this bill
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
put down what questions you have
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
we can take action and
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
if you have questions let me know ahead
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
of time so we can try to get the right
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
the big one coming our way is going to
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
be the marijuana bill that we have to
 
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to be having uh a bill
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
referred to us
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
after it passes the full house next week
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
and that's the marijuana bill
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
that marijuana bill has to do with the
 
01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.950 align:start position:0%
that marijuana bill has to do with the
state

01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:02.149 align:start position:0%
state
operating

01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
operating
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:07.510 align:start position:0%
 
businesses

01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
that only sell marijuana so the state
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
will operate like they do with liquor
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
they'll own
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
the marijuana stores
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
and they will sell and get the markup
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
and they will
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
contract with the growers and the
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
growers have to
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
which provides the material
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:29:32.719 --> 01:29:34.629 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
and

01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
they also estimate that
 
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
profits that they
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
come up with could easily be 250 million
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
dollars or more
 
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
so we need to understand
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
those issues
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
we're not going to deal with the policy
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
but we're going to deal with
 
01:29:58.960 --> 01:29:59.750 align:start position:0%
but we're going to deal with
where

01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.830 align:start position:0%
where
the

01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's a money issue how are they raising
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
the funds
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
and all the issues associated with that
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
because the federal government doesn't
 
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.149 align:start position:0%
because the federal government doesn't
allow

01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:30:14.159 --> 01:30:16.390 align:start position:0%
allow
money

01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
associated with marijuana sales to go
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
through the regular banking system
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
if they can't come up with one they want
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
to generate their own banking system
 
01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:28.470 align:start position:0%
to generate their own banking system
so

01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:29.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very interesting and
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
that that'll be coming to us can i
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
interject a few things on that yes yeah
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
yeah the banking thing we've already we
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
already talked to representative hunt
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
because he he covers banking his first
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
reaction is no
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
no way
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
but you know it can't go to two
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
committees but i think we'll probably
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
have representative that was that was
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
the last minute amendment to the bill
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh and the banking uh the uh head of the
 
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
banking bank association approached me
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
that they have big concerns about going
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
to state bank that's when i talked to
 
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.510 align:start position:0%
to state bank that's when i talked to
hunt

01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
hunt
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
he has concerns too but danny that's
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's that and then uh
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
so the way it's going to work is that
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
there'll be private growers
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
x number to be unlimited marketplace
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
driven that's going to that are going to
 
01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.430 align:start position:0%
driven that's going to that are going to
generate

01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
generate
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
business profits taxes
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be manufacturers
 
01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
that are going to make edibles
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
that would also be free enterprise that
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
the only thing that's going to be retail
 
01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be these actual stores it'll
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
be set up
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
and organizationally they have it set up
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
like the liquor commission under the
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
liquor commission actually it's going to
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
be liquor it's going to change the name
 
01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
of the liquor commission the
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
liquor and
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
liquor and cannabis commission
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
that's all in the bill
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
we'll be getting into those details
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
right so when we get the bill
 
01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:51.430 align:start position:0%
right so when we get the bill
and

01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:52.229 align:start position:0%
and
and

01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
what was
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
told to us is that at least half the
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
funds would come from the sale of these
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
so-called cookies
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
and so we'll need to get i know myself
 
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
i'll need to get educated i don't know
 
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
about the younger people
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have brownies
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
but rather represent
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh just to for
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
disclosure i'm a co-sponsor of that bill
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
and i look forward to the discussion on
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
this there is a way that
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
this can move forward being handled by
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
the state and also benefit all the
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
people of the state of new hampshire and
 
01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
those discussions will come forth with
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh the presentation that will be given
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
to you uh i think this is going to be a
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
very interesting hearing
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:41.679 --> 01:32:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%

talking to the banking commissioner yes
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%

the floor they'll be discussing it
 
01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be discussing it if we
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%

coming back in to do some committee work
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
here any rough idea yes the week after
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
the next next week is a busy week
 
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
and so to be the
 
01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
wake right after that
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
so don't wait until then
 
01:33:39.679 --> 01:33:40.390 align:start position:0%
so don't wait until then
to

01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%

recommendations let me know if there's
somebody

01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
that we need to contact
 
01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:49.350 align:start position:0%
that we need to contact
to

01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
meet with us at the work session so we
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh 15
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
65. i think i keep on getting that
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
number wrong
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
i really think there must be some way we
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
could talk with a member of the
 
01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.030 align:start position:0%
could talk with a member of the
commission

01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:20.870 align:start position:0%
commission
besides

01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
besides
 
01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:22.709 align:start position:0%
besides
on

01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
agreed by the commission is their only
 
01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.990 align:start position:0%
agreed by the commission is their only
spokesperson

01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
spokesperson
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
but i do think it would be useful if we
 
01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:36.229 align:start position:0%
but i do think it would be useful if we
could

01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
other than the attorney general's office
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
to also talk with us about it
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
let me work on that yeah mr chair
 
01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
i i agree and i i would also like to see
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
um representatives from other counties
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
come and talk to us
 
01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:58.310 align:start position:0%
come and talk to us
um

01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:59.669 --> 01:34:59.679 align:start position:0%
because we've we've heard from people
 
01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
from sullivan county as well you know
 
01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.350 align:start position:0%
from sullivan county as well you know
solely

01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
solely
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh i know that there are probably some
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh representatives from coast or
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
cheshire or some of the other counties
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
that might want to weigh in on this
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay i can work on
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
finding some folks if you like
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
i'm finding that very difficult because
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
in my own county
 
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:22.950 align:start position:0%
in my own county
on
